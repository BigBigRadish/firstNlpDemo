Mmmhmm.. right, right
What we have here.. is a collaboration
Of the big daddy kane.. and the little daddy shane
We're gonna send this out to.. all the brothers,
And sisters, around the universe
It's a tune.. a tune about unity..
And peace amongst each other
And we're gonna have some fun, peep this
The b-to-the-i-to-the-g-to-the-d
To-the-a-to-the-d-to-the-d-to-the-y
To-the-k-to-the-a-to-the-n-to-the-e
The smooth operator's in the place to be
,
The l-to-the-i-to-the-l-to-the-d
To-the-a-to-the-d-to-the-d-to-the-y
To-the-s-to-the-h-to-the-a-n-e
The little daddy shane for the world to see
Ricky-ticky-tempo, no surrembo
Italian men, call their girls a bimbo
Puerto rican men call their girls muchacha
Ask me how i know, cause i'm a girl watcher!
,
Now i must admit that i'm a sensitive guy
Cause i cried on cooley high when cochise died
But then again at times i may be a mean fellow
Cause i didn't give a damn about the dog old yeller
But i love my brother (and i love him back)
I wish people of the world could be like that
So shake shake y'all (shake y'all) shake y'all (shake y'all)
And bust the move we make y'all
Brother, brother.. help each other * repeat 2x *
,
I'm not don pardo, or guy lombardo
I love lucy, but i'm not ricky ricardo
I'm just a teen titan, that does some mean fightin
Against any sucker mc that's seen bitin
,
I been through different world's, gave them all a try
Kadeem is my man, but jasmine's not my guy
I wonder if the kane ever dawns on lewis
It's a sin to be bad, but somebody's gotta do it
,
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust (uh-huh)
I can make a nun feel the need for lust (true)
I can make a new car start to rust (uh-huh)
And outrun the dog on the greyhound bus
,
For an mc to try to battle me freestylin
His mind must be somewhere in fantasy island
But i guarantee that by the time i'm through
I make him feel about the size of the midget tattoo
Cause i love my brother (and i love him back)
And more people of the world should be like that
So swing swing y'all (swing y'all) swing y'all (swing y'all)
Check out how we do our thing y'all
Brother, brother.. help each other * repeat 2x *
,
Rhymes that i write generate much juice
Not like dr. seuss or even mother goose
They said i was a child, but then i hit em hard
Yeah it's good to send a boy to do a man's job
,
Well i'm the biggest daddy of the macks and dons
I keep a fleet of women, probably one of them's your moms
A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the fonz
,
Well i'm a new jack from the new school, too cool
But some of the times i get bizarre (word?)
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from melle mel
And start to yell, brrrrahhhhh!
,
While i'm up on stage i feel that it's my duty
To do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty
Because i add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion
But i love you shane (and i love you kane)
That's somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love y'all (love y'all) love y'all (love y'all)
Just a little bit of love y'all..
Peace!

,I wish you could see me
,All broken down this way
,But even if you saw me, baby

,You're gonna have to pay

,Oh, a woman like you needs fine things
,And I knew it from the start
,And I don't have much to offer
,Just this old broken heart, hey baby
,Just this old broken heart
,But if heartaches were nickels
,I wouldn't be here crying in the dark
,Yes, if wine and pills were hundred dollar bills,
,I might keep you satisfied
,And if broken dreams were limousines
,I might take you for a ride

Let go of your love
Ride his pulse and you forget
Slow down, your time will come
If not tonight, surely by the dawn
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
A cat's eye, a lizard's tail
The pentagram, he bought in hell
He stalks the night with no intent
His brow sweets for innocence
And take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
The rain's soul makes kill and cry
He wants desperately to die
But fast and skillfully forgets
He's back on the street with no regrets
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
Into the strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange, strange

Aww look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now your two
Baby you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

(Eminem as Kim)
(Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you?
Just leave me and love him out the blue
Oh, what's a matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at Kim
Look at your husband now!
(No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never going to get away at this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride bitch
Sit up front
(Well I can't just leave Haley alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back
Well I will you'll be in the trunk
 - So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
You really fucked me Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only 18
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh God my brain is racing
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him didn't you?
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me
Kim, KIM!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly don't you
(It's not that!)
No you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!
I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU
OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
Come on get out
(I can't I'm scared)
I said get out bitch!
(Let go of my hair, please don't do this baby)
(Please I love you, look we can just take Haley and leave)
Fuck you, you did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
Get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn't it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've...HEY! Where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! Ha! Got'cha!
(Ahh!)
Ha! Go ahead yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
AH SOMEBODY HELP!
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin to you
You were supposed to love me

NOW BLEED! BITCH BLEED!
BLEED! BITCH BLEED! BLEED!
Loreena McKennitt - Greensleeves


Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously;
And I have loved you oh so long
Delighting in your company.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

I have been ready at your hand
To grant whatever thou would'st crave;
I have waged both life and land
Your love and goodwill for to have.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

Thy petticoat of sendle white
With gold embroidered gorgeously;
Thy petticoat of silk and white
And these I bought gladly.

Greensleeves was my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's　almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love
Almost like being in love
Just like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Just like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love

This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Now who's that kickin' in the K for the West?
Shade pop with the flows that seep hoes in your vest
Half nigga with the word, half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangsta's but me up on game
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gonna change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin' off the broads I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin' bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin' rid of every coast
Still fuckin' with Mizz, we run trizz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenties what they hittin' for
See me if you wanna score, 'cuz I got what you need
Or you can see me at the club, tinted SUV
Gettin' in for free, I'm 'bout to get my name known
Sheist pull a heist nigga just to get it on
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, a gangsta's hard to deceive
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a thing
They ain't, trippin' off nothin' but things
So I, quickly disposed of my shades
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where would we aim
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic why don't you light it up
Yeah, show me somethin' I ain't never seen
I step in the house-party with a gangsta lean
It's Dogg Pound Gangsta's we strikin' back again
Ready to ride in the Lac again
Givin' it up for Mack 10 and T-Boz for doin' it
This ain't nothin' but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be
Nate Dogg and Kurupt broadcast for free
We at the Dogg House, where the dogs at
Who wanna get with me?
Baby meet me in the back
Young Damien Young, this is number two
Ridin' out room, nigga what you wanna do?
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic don't you light it up
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin' on some weed
You got chronic don't you light it up
This is where I wanna be

,
,I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggaz who gossip like bitches
,Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin'
,Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers
,Knowin' they lack the heart of those thats out on the benches
,I was out in the trenches-which enables me
,To write such a powerful picture like apocalypse now
,I put my heart in my lyrics every time I sit down to write
,My swords an inspiration, ain't three and a half mics
,I must have been an MC in my past life
,Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice
,People act like I don't deserve nothing I got
,I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted
,By customers knocks
,Some of y'all should just stop the animosity
,You got for me like it was not
,For years we ran a marathon, it's catastrophic
,Our time, death and pride came out on conquest
,Subsequently some are with me others ain't yet the gun is within
,Mr, I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
,Some place judgment against me based on nothing but envy
,They pray for my downfall like the song by biggie
,Born in the city which never sleeps to rest the piece
,It's carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat
,Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny
,Accept her, hope she never see the jealousy success can bring
,The trifle life and death of kings
,I'm from the rarest breed of people
,Who rep the street and spit poetically
,Never sleep, rest assured mega is dope in his pure form
,The dealer, MC keepin' it real is my protocol
,Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin' on it
,The beat is lifeless, till I put my verses on it
,I reminisce confinement as I read a kite
,From my people with secret indictment freedom and triumph
,Contemplating putting sprees on the tires
,Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
,I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on the wire
,What other lyricist is known for giving people consignment
,I'm eager with rhyming, I rock iceberg jeans with Nikes
,In extremists with rapping thats deep as posidan
,Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful environment
,A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding
,Some probably will fear me from seeing me shining
,Like a phoenix arising from the deep show in the reef with defiance
,Whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,It's yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
,Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
,To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
,Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
,The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
,The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe     hip-hop
,The mind activation, react like I'm facing
,Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
,Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
,Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
,Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
,I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
,I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
,I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
,I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
,I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
,Whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,It's yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
,To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
,I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
,Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
,Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
,The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
,Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
,Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
,There's no days for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
,While all the old folks pray to Jes煤s, soakin' their sins in trays
,Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
,Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
,My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
,Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
,How you living, large -- a broker charge, cards are mediocre
,You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
,It's yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?

,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,I'm the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
,For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
,Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
,I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
,I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
,Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
,Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
,Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
,And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
,Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
,The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
,Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
,Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stoge
,Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
,Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today
,It's yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
,The world is yours, the world is yours
,It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?

Wakin up the mind, wakin up the soul
Sunshine from the brother, let's take a stroll
A jeep goes boom, a mother holds an infant
I hear some buckshots goin off in the distance
I see the visions of my brothers no longer here
I hold back a tear, wind whispers in my ear
The kids in the middle of the street I see 'em playin catch
Make it from the one cause the socks don't match
But with the ancestor both the young kings are blessed
A man and a woman leave the church overdressed
Far from the Lord, close to the Benz
My mother hit the lotto now she got a lot of friends
A young girl starin in the car to the right
I smile back, taken by my own sense of sight
The cops drive by to do some more good deeds
And a young black male spits the sunflower seeds in the air
,

Tests of the strength as the young mack stare
A black queen is judged by the length of her hair
Self-hate grows and it flows like a flood
The light-skinned black's lovin the slavermaster's blood
To be grown up is what the young girl want
See the childhood is short like the life of a blunt
Fertilize your egg cause he whispered in your ear
But you won't have his kid cause he got nappy hair
To the game I'm true like the sun first rose
I'm real like my man Michael Jackson's first nose
Wind blows let the tiny baby take the first step
But at the same time the old man takes a last breath from the air
,

Is this really the end?
Or is it a new beginning?
A new reality
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions

For I am the lifesaver
Scooby doo wah, scooby doo wee
Like a jazz player, I improvise wisely
Free with the style, I flow like the Nile
But remember, don't mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin'
Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing
But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin' here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin' there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin' to kill me and all of us, my friend
But don't bend to the mental strain
Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life, the Lord gave ya
And that's a message from the lifesaver, the lifesaver
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver, I am the lifesaver
It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off
'Cause nowadays everybody's a killer
And as for me, no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life that's been torn apart
Over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence
That the money only takes precedence
'Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die
During every hour, I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver, the lifesaver
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver
People talk about the Armaggedeon
And nowadays everyone, you know is packin' lead son
Each day's another test, aiyyo, I better do my best
'Cause a lot's ridin' on my chest
So when I lead you to the water, you best know
How to swim across, so you can reach the border
It's international, the message and the flavor
So here's some more important words from the lifesaver
The lifesaver, the lifesaver
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I am the lifesaver

I want to tease you
I want to please you
I want to show you baby
That I need you
I want your body
'Till the very last drop girl
I want you to holler
When you want me to stop
And who can love you like me (nobody)
Who can sex you like me (nobody)

yo, the first time I met you it was love on sight
no matter what I do I can't forget that night
in my mind you was fine as wine, air tight
somethin' like a movie, but this is real life
no mistaken, unh, I was taken
girl you hit me harder than the music I be makin'
I exercise, push-ups, how you feel huh?
what's your name girl? how can I get wit' ya?
I can't beleive that she didn't heed that
no type of feed back, I need to pull my sleeves back
and try again, time after time
but I won't stop until I make the girl mine
,
,
I got the digits, unh, remember I was
on the telephone kickin' willy bone for hours
buyin' candy and flowers, often
I can't count amounts but I know I spend a fortune
I never sweat it, you was so cute
that I ran like Pacman in hot pursuit (back back back)
all my friends say you must be buggin' kid
you say I'm just a friend to make me feel like this
but I would never do you like the next guy did
scared to love again and keepin' your heart hid
and just when I think you might come around soon
you proceed to hit me wit' that wait a while tune
,
,
vision of love, the one I think of
if I had my way we'd be tighter than a glove
on the scale of one to ten you must be an eleven
baby hold my hand and walk the highway to heaven
I'm not the same old thing runnin' the game type
love 'em and leave 'em alone, catch the next flight
I promise you, I'm a stay true
if you call my name I'll come to the rescue
I mean a queen like you deserves honor
scoop you in a drop-top Porchse, my tire's armored
for worse or better, no matter what the weather
it don't really matter, we still down together
I got your back, in fact, I'll never hurt you
mislead, decieve, Shaq won't desert you
just call me crazy, I just say whatever
prayin' for the day I'll make you my girl forever

,Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
,That she could make money  and she did it like a dummy
,Now I see her in commercials  she's universal
,She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
,Now she be in the burbs lookin' rock and dressin' hip
,And on some dumb shit  when she comes to the city
,Talkin about poppin glocks  servin rocks  and hittin switches
,Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
,Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
,Tellin me sad stories  now she only fucks with the funk
,Stressin how hardcore and real she is
,She was really the realest  before she got into show-biz
,I did her  not just to say that I did it
,But I'm committed  but so many niggaz hit it
,That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
,I see niggaz slammin her  and takin her to the sewer
,But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop
,Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop
,
,To the beat y'all and you don't stop
,Yes yes, y'all and you don't stop
,Ya'll be the sure shot,

,这一路上走走停停 顺着少年漂流的痕迹
,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打
,-M-
,短短的路走走停停 也有了几分的距离
,不知抚摸的是故事 还是段心情
,也许期待的不过是 与时间为敌
,再次看到你 微凉晨光里 笑的很甜蜜
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,-=-
,晚风吹起你鬓间的白发 抚平回忆留下的疤 你的眼中 明暗交杂 一笑生花
,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话
,我仍感叹于世界之大 也沉醉于儿时情话 不剩真假 不做挣扎 无谓笑话
,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了
,以爱之名 你还愿意吗

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off the law, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
,I'm superman with the wind at his back
,Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
,Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
,You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pain
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eye ball
,Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,雨后有车驶来
,驶过暮色苍白
,旧铁皮往南开 恋人已不在
,收听浓烟下的 诗歌电台
,不动情的咳嗽 至少看起来
,归途也还可爱
,琴弦少了姿态
,再不见那夜里 听歌的小孩
,时光匆匆独白
,将颠沛磨成卡带
,已枯卷的情怀 踏碎成年代
,就老去吧 孤独别醒来
,你渴望的离开
,只是无处停摆
,就歌唱吧 眼睛眯起来
,而热泪的崩坏
,只是没抵达的存在
,青春又醉倒在
,籍籍无名的怀
,靠嬉笑来虚度 聚散得慷慨
,辗转却去不到 对的站台
,如果漂泊是成长 必经的路牌
,你迷醒岁月中
,那贫瘠的未来
,像遗憾季节里 未结果的爱
,弄脏了每一页诗
,吻最疼痛的告白
,而风声吹到这 已无需释怀
,就老去吧 孤独别醒来
,你渴望的离开
,只是无处停摆
,就歌唱吧 眼睛眯起来
,而热泪的崩坏
,只是没抵达的存在
,不说话 以为 沉默能让时光走的缓慢
,不想念 以为 感伤是生活中的小习惯
,一个个 心结 忽然间自己解出了答案
,一个个 旧友 疏于联络也许已有新的伴
,
,我顺着时针在青春里面打转
,一双手推开时光的门 忘记了关
,多少日子如快门一闪
,到几年后 一个镜头就切换
,
,我逆着时针到回忆里头参观
,一圈圈回圈出不同的 情绪片段
,放任热泪围困住心酸
,想说成熟 要用多少个领悟交换
,
,快乐或 孤单 一天的时光用另一天填满
,凌晨或 傍晚 一样的天色掠过晚归的站
,梦里 那个人 遁入另一个梦为谁辗转
,我们的 故事 也落入俗套一去不返

,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话

Barry Manilow - I Can't Give You Anything But Love

I can't give you anything but love...baby
That's the only thing there's plenty of...baby
Dream a while...scheme a while
You're sure to find....happiness and I guess
All those things you've pined for

Gee I love to see you lookin' swell...baby
Diamond bracelets woolworths' doesn't sell...baby
Till that lucky day, you know darn well...baby
I can't give you anything but love

Gee I love to see you lookin' swell...baby
Diamond bracelets woolworths' doesn't sell...baby
Till that lucky day, you know darn well...baby
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love

Gee I love to see you lookin' swell...baby

What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's　almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love
Almost like being in love
Just like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Just like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love
,But Not For Me

,They're writing songs of love but not for me
,A lucky star's above but not for me
,With love to lead the way
,I've found more clouds of gray
,Than any Russian play can guarantee
,
,I was a fool to fall and get that way
,Ah ho alas and awe so lackaday
,Although I can't dismiss
,The memory of her kiss
,I guess she's not for me

Lyrics：Andy Razaf Music：Benny Goodman/Chick Webb/Edgar Sampson
Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.
How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;
The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.
How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never, never, never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you.
please send me someone to love
Sade

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love.

Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.
But, if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.
HMMMMMmmmmmm
There Will Never Be Another
-Brown Bannister & Amy Grant-
By doraliz

There will never be another who will love me like You
There will never be another who could hold me, mold me
There will never be another who could love me purely
No there will never be another who has loved me like You
And I know that there will never be another love
Who could ever be the love that You are
Cause You had so much to lose but still You gave it up for Your scars
But that's the way you are
And if I spent my life attending universities,
Educated in the wisdom of men
And if I could even quote a guy like Socrates,
even then I couldn't comprehend
There will never be another who will love me like You
There will never be another who could hold me, mold me
There will never be another who could love me purely
No there will never be another who has loved me like You
And I know I'll never understand this mystery
If I live to be a hundred and three
How You died to live the love You give to me
There will never be another who will love me like You
There will never be another who could hold me, mold me
There will never be another who could love me purely
No there will never be another who has loved me like You
There will never be another who has loved me like You

(First Chorus)
This little song for my father
Does things that no other
Can do
As I sing it to you

It has a rhythm and rhyme
That will fasten his memory
In time
As his beauty shines through

For through my mind and soul
My heart will always hold
A special place for him
It's true

(Second Chorus)

We bow our heads and we pray
Every day's Father's Day
Let's review
All that he means to you

Our mother's love is real nice
But old Dad sacrificed
For us too
Let us give him his due

We're very proud to be
In his biography
We sing this song for him
And you
Autumn Leaves - Laura Fygi
"千金百分百电视原声带"
The falling leaves
drift by the window
The autumn leaves
of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
old winter's song
But I miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves
start to fall
,
,
,
,
,Stars shining bright above you
,Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
,Birds singing in the sycamore tree
,Dream a little dream of me
,Say "Nighty-night" and kiss me
,Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
,While I'm alone and blue as can be
,Dream a little dream of me
,Stars fading but I linger on dear
,Oh how you linger on
,Still craving your kiss
,How you crave my kiss
,Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
,Just saying this
,Give me a little kiss
,Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
,Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
,But in your dreams, whatever they be
,Dream a little dream of me
,
,Stars fading but I linger on dear
,Still craving your kiss
,Yeah, I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

,Keep dreaming
,Gotta keep dreamin'
,Leave your worries far behind you
,But in your dreams, whatever they be
,You gotta make me a promise
,Promise to me you'll dream
,Dream a little dream of me
,Quand il me prend dans ses bras
,Il me parle tout bas,
,Je vois la vie en rose.

,
, You are the promised kiss of springtime
, That makes the lonely winter seem long
, You are the breathless hush of evening
, That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
, You are the angel glow that lights a star
, The dearest things I know are what you are
, Some day my happy arms will hold you
, And some day I'll know that moment divine
, When all the things you are, are mine
, You are the angel glow that lights a star
, The dearest things I know are what you are
, Some day my happy arms will hold you
, And some day I'll know that moment divine
, When all the things you are, are mine

,je veux seulement l'oublier et puis je fume...

,un million de roses n'embaumerait pas autant.
,Maintenant une seule fleur

,
,Something cool
,I'd like to order something cool
,It's so warm here in town and this heat gets me down
,Yes, I'd like something cool
,
,My, it's nice to simply sit and rest awhile
,You know it's a shame
,I can't think of your name
,I remember your smile
,
,I don't ordinarily drink with strangers
,I guess I usually drink alone
,But you were so awfully nice to ask me
,And I'm so terribly far from home
,
,Like my dress I must confess it's very old
,But it's simple and neat, it's just right for this heat
,Save my furs for the cold
,A cigarette, no I don't smoke them as a rule
,But I'll have one, it might be fun with something cool
,
,I'd bet you wouldn't imagine that I once had a house
,With so many rooms you couldn't count them all
,I'll bet that you couldn't imagine I had fifteen different boys
,Who would beg and beg to take me to a ball
,
,And I know you couldn't picture me
,The time I went to Paris in the fall
,And who would think the man that I loved
,Was quite so handsome and quite so tall
,
,Well, it's through, it's just a memory I had
,One I almost forgot since the weather's so hot
,And I'm feeling so bad about a date, oh wait, I'm such a fool
,He's just a guy who stopped to buy me something cool

,Make Love To Me
,Instead of making conversations
,Make love to me
,Make love to me, my darling
,While there is still a mood
,Must I extend an invitation
,To make love to me
,Make love to me, my darling
,Tonight will end so soon
,There are moments
,When my lips adore addressing you
,But tonight my lips are only for
,Caressing you but how about you
,Before the mood that I'm in changes
,Make love to me
,Make love to me, my darling
,I'm so in love with you
,I can't help it if my lips want kisses
,And my heart begs for love
,I'm so in love with you
,
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,They say that falling in love is wonderful
,So wonderful, so they say
,
,The thing that's known as romance is wonderful
,So wonderful, so they tell me
,
,I can't recall who said it
,I know I never read it
,I only know they tell me that love is grand
,And
,If there's a moon up above
,It's wonderful, wonderful
,In every way, so they say
,
,
,
,You leave your house one morning
,And without any warning
,You'll find yourself shouting that love is grand
,To hold your girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
,In every way, So they say
,
,Quizas, quizas, quizas.
,Siempre que te pregunto
,Que cuando, como y donde
,Tu siempre me respondes
,Quizas, quizas, quizas.
,Y asi pasan los dias

Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.
My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt
So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.
I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

Hues of blues and greens surround me
Knowing you have found another love
Has turned me world to sorrow
Green with envy for another
Fearing she may be the one to soar
Through life with you, can't lose these
Hues of blues in green

,I swear to you that baby for the rest of my days
,I will never forget that you make me smile

,你说你喜欢粉色香槟的粉
,我问你是否爱过一个不该爱过的人
,你说是否过于浪漫一切会失真
,我说我感觉自己现在好像拿破仑
,你突然笑笑 这画面感觉惟妙惟肖
,这氛围缠绕 有时候 浪漫多妖娆
,慢慢变熟悉 动作也渐渐随意
,我事先声明 今天我可没**
,你问我口感怎样 我如实回答
,我说你长的漂亮 你说谢谢夸奖
,进入正题 我话题随机 文字的功底
,你闭上眼睛 我把画面传给你
,这回忆一样的初夏之风叫千羽
,多年以后会温暖的把你回忆起
,你说再浪漫的语言都不及我爱你
,我说这么直接 会吓到我自己
,
,（你温柔的拂面）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,（三月的春艳）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,我向你描绘着书籍里的点点红尘
,你说你不知何时才能遇见想遇见的人
,轻描淡写的口吻 一切随缘 会等
,一人好过 敌不过 两人的体温
,我还是烟雾环绕
,把话题打住
,免得你思绪焦躁
,浪漫的夜晚还是用浪漫去探讨
,手里的北极光 燃烧并发出讯号
,我让你重温时间 那些曾发过的誓言
,恰好的晕眩 慢慢回忆两人画面
,恰巧的浮现 恰当的描绘他的脸
,恰到你最爱的季节 他却向你告别
,分开的时候总带有太多抱歉
,伤感的季节又积累太多抱怨
,热恋的触觉 败给了时间
,我们总是伤害着又爱着像是做实验
,只为了你出现
,我也在做实验
,你也在做实验

,不想把你错过即使我有过错害怕落寞发生晚上
,你总是 不让我跟女生聊天超过三句
,释放贪欲把我关进男友监狱
,虽然说身边可能一直环绕异性
,但是我早就修炼不动如山的意境
,毕竟与你相比 她们显得太过差劲

,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落
,边拥有边失去着
,我知道自己是一个普通的人
,最后也会被埋进一座普通的坟
,但我得感谢说唱帮我打开了这扇大门
,让我在孤独的世界里不再往下沉
,这是2017年一个普通的夜晚
,我想我的失眠症也没得到好转
,坐在电脑前一遍遍听着beat
,感觉浑身无力面对这人生游戏
,服下一袋助眠药剂
,我也想做个用全力追寻梦想的人毫不畏惧勇敢的走
,但现实却关上了所有的门让我白费努力像个小丑
,可以不可以有一天能做自己的神哪怕宣告我一无所有
,我希望能遇见你在某个美好清晨拥抱我的是谁的双手
,停下的笔 笔下的纸 纸上的你
,还没写完的是未熄灭的努力
,是否这一切快没有了意义
,没有关系 一个声音告诉我应该继续
,别停下去把想说的话给传递
,他问我是否感觉累了 好像已经用尽全力
,但我不能在这里睡了 我还得继续去努力
,让糟糕的世界看到我的骨气
,留下我曾在这里斗争过的痕迹
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落
,边拥有边失去着
,我来自南方 一座特别的城市
,导师是谁来充当 饶舌带我去新的层次
,不太绅士 最后被磨平了身上的刺
,变得不再真实 但对热爱还是继续坚持
,想赚多一点钱 不用谁来可怜
,虽然压力挤出的眼泪尝起来感觉很咸
,但坚持过后你会发觉它回味确实甘甜
,欣喜若狂的感觉让我在几个夜里持续失眠
,他们说曾努力过 就算最后失败到头破血流也不会疑惑
,那我最大的优点是不是哪怕被现实摧残也绝不认错
,每次被敲打被辱骂被笑话也总是告诉自己加油振作
,二十一岁的我面对这些事情哪怕困难也要不甘示弱
,这首歌在这里写下是为了表明我的决心
,把思想放进歌词里是让他更加动听
,流下的汗水在某一天会凝结成为结晶
,保持信念记住你的名字跟成功谐音
,最后请记住我的名字 y e z
,想成为一个真的rapper我会努力十倍
,告诉自己已经没有东西可以再去浪费
,怀抱着坚持入睡 直到品尝到成功的滋味
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落
,边拥有边失去着

,Verse 1:
,过去就让他过去
,但无法逾越内心的这道坎
,妄想从脑海过滤
,却越加清晰
,仿佛时间在倒转
,关于你的记忆 脑中循环播放
,关于你的消息 不断四处打探
,明知道身处同在一座城市
,却感觉像是 海霞隔着两岸
,担心你遇到的下一个他
,只不过为了要带你回家
,担心你脸上的装都哭花
,最后确只能是自己来擦
,越去想就陷得越深
,智商都被幻想侵吞
,朋友随便 拿你 跟我开个玩笑
,我都能傻到把这一切当真

,Verse 2:
,早知道今日
,何必当初
,心痛的反复
,究竟是出于愧疚还是对你不舍
,过去这么久却没法感悟
,就像是拔不出的倒刺
,而这把心头锁的钥匙
,被握在你的手里
,所以也只有你
,能够拨开这愁云惨雾
,于是乎
,再一次向你靠近

,当我睁开眼睛 太阳已经下山
,早就不再年轻 熬夜后的负担
,洗去身上的血迹 换过新的床单
,好像一切没有发生过 太阳没上升过
,他财迷心窍装做没事打闹嬉笑
,再脏的钱都收他看似苦恼其实心在笑
,他的心眼太小 看到的只是外表
,还太早 不知道自己是谁 他还在找
,他也是上帝的孩子吗
,我怎麽想要把他换掉 脱罪以后表情依然的自然
,以他的智商 可以逃过这世上 所有的罪不够让他受 就算全身是伤
,试图脱罪的人 蒙羞祖先的魂 在挖掘魔鬼的坟 以为能灌醉了神
,他的家在哪 没把话讲真 听著音乐 他们只能继续等
,他说
,他只是想要脱罪 难道这样不行吗
,他只是想要脱罪 有谁能够原谅他
,祷告吧孩子 祷告吧孩子
,低著头闭上眼唸出祷告词
,祷告吧孩子 祷告吧孩子

,WOO HALLELUJAH
,我说 跪下吧 跪下吧 神的孩子
,主 请祢让他 对天微笑 感受 祢的仁慈
,让他的心可以重头 像是溪流清澈的源头
,其实他 并没有错 只是被人怂恿
,他的心有太多恨 不愿意尝试了解就先下定论
,受够了这些鸟事 不想被笑笨
,他只想要相信人 但是遇到的都是好人 那也不见得
,就算站在悬崖边 有绳子不愿抓
,昧著良心讲话 好话也不愿夸
,他们不是帮派 但是捨不得拿下真面具
,唯有武装自己才能得人尊敬不变的定律
,他不想被取笑 总是被人比较
,他只能树立敌人才显得没乱阵脚
,他需要归属 不是选边
,主请祢让他用祢的眼光看这世界 AMEN
,他只是想要脱罪 难道这样不行吗

,一份pancake和sunny side up的煎蛋
,外加一份morning kiss是完美的早餐
,下过雨的午后走在Santamonica blvd
,流浪的歌手还有淋湿的吉他站在那
,手捧一束鲜花 耳机放着beat
,想用一点时间写首情歌送给你

,我是医生却已治不好我患上的癌
,想要说出内心的爱就在此时此刻

,给我讲讲妳的故事好吗，在深夜。
,那些古老或是新鲜关于妳的一切。
,酒后的夜里风雨孤独，太真切。
,妳被吹散了头发 拥抱后离别。
,今晚的星星全被偷走装进了妳的眼睛，
,暗无天日感情中我一觉睡到天明。
,是天晴 想约妳出去压个马路。
,我想把妳带回到我的家里住。
,我想问问妳喜欢什么样的男生，
,是沉默 是成熟 或者和妳谈谈人生。
,或者是我这种总是假装很深沉，
,或是西装革履带给妳的安稳。
,妳的回应还没着落
,我是真的害怕搞错
,我们不能就这样子错过
,我会落寞 落魄 这感觉抑扬顿挫
,给妳的信没了回信，
,留言信箱没了回音。
,消息码长后又归零，
,妳让我有点儿灰心。
,我们不能这样下去抽空请妳喝杯咖啡，
,傍晚请妳喝杯清酒今天多喝几杯。
,是否人醉了就会说出心里话，
,你对我动心的时候有几刹。
,为妳开始活动摆脱了拖延症。
,曾经厌倦害我得了爱情徒劳病。
,不要在一起就像没头脑和不高兴，
,我们总要和谁分享内心的风景。
,要牵着我的手吗 回家不去酒吧，
,阳光发酵过往只剩下海浪与沙。
,人类孤独太久之后总是开始想家，
,男人想着西服 女人想着婚纱。

,好累 又上了一天班
,我只想回家不想熬夜再到一点半
,还是倒数记得brt是四北站
,公文包中的让我对习惯感觉不习惯
,一样是熟悉的街道都是陌生的人
,不一样的心情但表情都木然的逼真
,我在想为什么我也一样没法去微笑
,可是当她的出现突然气氛变得微妙
,she like angel
,在我的九点钟方向定格
,she like angel
,甚至怀疑她应该不算过客
,是那种不一样的感觉不会太冷也不太热
,是那种有着干净面貌散发香味眼神清澈
,如果 有可能她会成为我的另一半
,那我也不会觉得疲惫
,哪怕每天都上班到这么晚
,时间是这么短 相遇是这么晚
,有你的距离怎么这么难
,他的衬衫领口很白 眼神明显发呆
,我在想怎样一个男生发呆也这么帅
,我猜他这一整天肯定累的够呛
,明显他身材很瘦很高脂肪很少不够胖
,我在想 如果他换上休闲装是什么样
,如果他是我的男朋友会对我怎么样
,怎么会我想的好像有点多但也不算太过
,那如果只是如果 我希望他会说
,我带你环游世界 去最湛蓝的海边
,在巴黎向你求婚 看北海道的蓝天
,要是你累了给你最坚实的臂膀
,要是你饿了给你煮最地道的玉米浓汤
,我会做你的superman 保护你每时每刻
,会做你的bestfriend 一定是最贴心的那一个
,当然也算是闺蜜陪你吐槽身边每个不开心和安慰你的哭泣
,我不想这是如果 就算幻想会出错
,我不想关闭思路 因为你依旧是陌生人
,是路过的人没必要靠幻想来等
,似乎在距离之间相隔一条狭长的梗
,我很想认识你 但你的眼神逃避
,我很想认识你 但依旧保持距离
,我开始相信一见钟情因为见到你
,我开始相信我的直觉他说必须认识你
,但是我应该怎么开口你才会选择回答
,我不太希望你说客套的你好是回答
,我不想太快以往 思路在矛盾相撞
,两米的距离看上去像地狱和天堂
,我不想这次错过但似乎还是沉默
,我不想这次错过但害怕我会做错
,在两米之间难以抉择的是我的懦弱
,在两米之间难以进退因为我的沉默
,我不想这次错过但似乎还是沉默
,我不想这次错过但害怕我会做错
,在嘈杂之中趁机
,似乎车也快到了
,依旧没对白的命运
,我知道你错过了
,我不想这次错过但似乎还是沉默
,我不想这次错过但害怕我会做错
,在两米之间难以抉择的是我的懦弱
,在两米之间难以进退因为我的沉默

曾经的校园生活已经离我远去
用吸管折出的星星塞进了这玻璃
纸条里是答案还是表白呢藏着秘密
被同学们发现后把我嘲笑 我实在气

看不到微信提示也不用去刷着动态
长长的博客空间更加适合拿去记载
没有酒精的夜看着天空也很有感觉
我现在就想回去继续上回我的中学

期待你来电 黑白屏幕的里面
300条短讯要包月我却一一去只为你呈现
那时小灵通最便宜 适合煲电话粥
上课还回着短信结果却被老师收

喜欢下课就冲出教室去打个篮球
iverson的海报贴在了宿舍门的后头
拿出我磁带 插入了复读机
今晚又是谁的音乐伴随着我入息

我想 再次 回去看到你的笑脸
十年 之后 却只想要回到从前
好久 不见 那种感觉十分留念
没有钱的日子 还有那段初恋

把校服裤脚改小 这才是fashion flow
天台上找个墙角 躲起来开始抽
今天的考试结果 依然是六十六
只要能够及格就好其他我就不担忧

生活像场话剧每个人都有大的改变
同学录你的梦想填了什么有没实现
如今环境压力太大 我有点害怕
会不会成为那个我最不想成为的大傻

你的眼睛告诉我 保护好你的梦
你的眼睛告诉我 其实这都不疼
你的眼睛告诉我 抱住理想就往前冲
别被表像蒙惑 杀出从围做大前锋

这清晰的思路来自一张照片
 深邃的眼神 触碰脑海画面 
已经浑浑噩噩糊里糊涂又度过了几年
突然帮助我找回了出发时的新鲜

当我开始准备行动你别靠近
自己顾好自己 每一步留下的烙印
我知道你总是在嘲笑我只是凭运气
令人羡慕的足迹 我都还没用力

深蓝色包装的香烟 重复的抽
屡屡被侵犯的底线 拼命的hold
精彩又危险的目标 手握盾和剑
开始盲从一切 最终谁也都没出线

看看说好一起出发的现在又剩下几个
还没到达半路就相继离开放弃说算了要撤 
可惜我早已经别无 选择了朋友 没有退路了朋友
我先离开队伍了朋友 

我撕开我的面具给你看看我的疼 
机会不会来的容易 彩票不会中 
道理 你都懂 不行动 又有 什么用
很失望你也过得和他们一样大众

我不想成群又结队变成一样糊涂
没玩没了的里程碑自己玩最舒服
讨厌我的个性缞 讨厌我的态度
那哥们你是哪一位我一点都不在乎

我不想听你胡说 教我该去怎么做 en
多花点时间去感受 谁都没有可能不犯错
拿着别人道理去教 无形中形成了信条
把我思路给挡住了单独的一个人抢着呢先去过桥

我的行为不够chill 也想活更自由
谁不想得到更多自由把钱钱钱当个球
我不想制造些争斗 最后自己去承受
赶快离我远点 免得染到你身上的狐臭

哥们的Leven不止难攀 像早世纪的南蛮
不要在我背后喷粗 真正实力特别难缠
花拳绣腿的行动力别想吸引我注意
名言金句都当放屁往前冲我沉住气

一次又一次地指指点点指指点点
一次又一次地指指点点指指点点
一次又一次地指指点点指指点点
一次又一次地指指点点指指点点

你的眼睛告诉我 保护好你的梦
你的眼睛告诉我 其实这都不疼
你的眼睛告诉我 抱住理想就往前冲
别被表像蒙惑 杀出从围做大前锋

你的眼睛告诉我 是你的就能得的到
你的眼睛告诉我 去忘掉那些假的名号
你的眼睛告诉我 一直一直告诉我
别管未来能不能火音乐播放继续跳

A jeśli Ty
Znikniesz gdzieś
Nie wiem jak 
Mam odnaleźć cię
A jeśli ja 
Gdzieś zgubię się
Podpowiedz jak 
Znów zdobyć Cie

Wiem już jak to jest gdy nie ma cię
Wszystko dzieje się inaczej 
Tak jak tego chcę
Chociaż cały czas uśmiecham się
Nie potrafię być bez ciebie 
Dobrze o tym wiesz

A jesli ktoś
Zabierze Cię nie pozwól mi 
Łatwo poddać się
A jeśli Ty 
Będziesz tego chciał
Naucz mnie jak cofnąć czas

Wiem już jak to jest gdy nie ma cię
Wszystko dzieje się inaczej 
Tak jak tego chcę
Chociaz caly czas uśmiecham się
Nie potrafię byc bez ciebie dobrze o tym wiesz (x2)

,Get messed up today
,I'll be okay tomorrow
,
,Hey yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back
,Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work (word)
,That crazy shit, yeah the stupid shit
,Hey yo Eazy! (Yo!)
,Hey man why don't you come off the piano for a minute
,And bust this crazy shit
,Woke up quick at about noon
,Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
,I gotta get drunk before the day begins
,Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
,About to go and damn near went blind
,Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs
,Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
,With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip
,Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
,Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
,Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride
,I got front back and side to side
,Then I let the Alpine play
,Bumpin' new shit by NWA
,It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list
,Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this:
,Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
,Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
,Went to the park to get the scoop
,Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
,A car pulls up, who can it be?
,A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G
,He rolls down his window and he started to say
,It's all about makin' that GTA
,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
,You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
,Down on B's in the place to give me the pace
,He said my man JB is on freebase
,The boy JB was a friend of mine
,Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
,Chased him up the street to call a truce
,The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce
,Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
,One sucker dead, LA Times front page
,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
,You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
,Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
,So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
,The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
,I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
,They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
,And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
,Left to get my girl, to rock that body
,Before I left I hit the Bacardi
,Went to her house to get her out of the pad
,Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
,She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
,So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
,She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
,Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
,Her father jumped up and he started to shout
,So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out
,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
,You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
,I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
,Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll
,I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother
,I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
,Walkin home and I see the G ride
,Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
,As they busted a U, they got pulled over
,An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
,Kat got beat for resistin arrest
,He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
,Now G is cut for doin the crime
,For defence on the boy, he'll do some time
,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
,You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit
,I went to get them out but there was no bail
,The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
,Two days later in municipal court
,Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork
,"Disruption of the court", said the judge
,On a six year sentence my man didn't budge
,Bailiff came over to turn him in
,Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
,He yelled out "FIRE!", then came Suzi
,The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
,Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
,Both up state for attempted murder
,Cuz the boyz n tha hood are always hard
,You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card
,Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
,Don't quote me boy, cuz I ain't sayin' shit

,I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
,Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
,staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
,I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
,Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
,Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
,You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
,Running into the dark underground
,All the subways around create a great sound
,To my motion fatigue: farewell
,With your ear to a seashell
,You can hear the waves in underwater caves
,As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
,
,Time together is just never quite enough
,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
,We need time, only time
,When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
,If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
,So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
,All the time, all the time
,Can you believe that the crew has gone
,and wouldn't let me sign on?
,All my islands have sunk in the deep,
,so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
,I feel as if I were home some nights
,when we count all the ship lights
,I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
,We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
,~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~

,Don't let it be a sad, sad song
,Baby tell me something I don't wanna hear
,Come say you need me, turn around and disappear
,Come take me deeper, kick my heart and make my soul
,Come say you love me, turn around and let me go
,Like a knife do it right, cut me deep cut me slow
,All my life, you would try but you'll never know
,Am I a masochist to let them in each time
,What don't kill you makes you stronger, I know I'll be fine
,Better than the last time
,Oooh, oooh

,Yeeeeaaaaaaaah

,And keep your guard up, or life will know your tooth out
,Cuz' it's a cold world, homie, but I'm loose out
,I hear em calling for me, howling was loose out

,And when they told me that I'll never be
,All that I dreamed of, baby I still believe
,Ooohh, nothing can break me, or they'll take me

,Harder push me harder, I grow stronger hear them calling
,and you can watch me(yes you can)
,BUT YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
,Nah, cuz’ I ain't slowing down for nothing
,The power's inside, so I'm blowing up - Combustion
,My pens blowing, the inks bleeding, the paper soaks it
,And I read it, recite it, and ya'll feel it
,Because I've been practicing writing for 12 seasons

,I've seen you change a lot you seen me grow up
,From when my flow sucked threw shows but no one showed up
,And so what you still had my back through the rain
,It's crazy when I think about the change insane and lately
,They show me love so when I spit I represent you
,The 2-0 through gowe 6'ing instrumentals
,Killing any beat in itself I'm speaking
,Myself so when the heat peeks I'm keeping it seeking for help
,You light my eyes up when the night falls
,So I slow down on I-5 to get a better picture
,You're so pretty
,I could leave but I would miss ya
,And to breathe in the sea is where the air is never crisper
,I've seen people leave but I'm a stand right here
,So if the spotlight shines
,You're gonna be right there
,But tell me if I had no rhythm or flow
,Would you still have a place in the city for gowe
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I had a passion to write the pen was glued to my hand
,When I was writing these poems they were forming a band
,Alone did I stand my dreams still intact all the times
,I was smacked for even mentioning rap
,Now my folks love it and they just came to a show
,They don't catch all of the words but they applaud for gowe
,And as a son, that brings a big smile to my face
,So When I'm done
,I'll leave the bright lights of the stage and recline
,Reminisce on the times like my first battle At the Nippon kan theatre
,I lost that one Or my first out of state gig
,And the crowd was small
,Or the time we didn't have a stage at terry hall
,But we still rocked it
,and it's for the love of the art
,And a rest in peace goes out to the dearly depart
,So I bump biggie smalls one of the best emcees
,While I zone out at my spot as I reflect on me
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me? Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I used to sit at this bench and just write rhymes
,So I could see the city lights and memorize the skylines
,So when I closed my eyes
,I would see without seeing you
,It was beautiful the nights were so colorful
,And now that I've grown up I return to the spot
,And take a seat on this bench you got me thinking a lot
,About the past and the present and Whether not I was destined
,Or is it really a question will I compromise in my message?
,Never, you also told me that my rhymes were too hard
,That it was a bit complex and so I took it to heart
,Now my parts are more friendly extending my hand
,Not as abstract as then so we can both understand
,See you relate to my words cause I experience you
,Not to mention we been close since the days of my youth
,So regardless of where I flew or might travel around
,Where there's gowe there'll also be Seattle my town
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?

,Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
,I always thought it would only be one kiss
,One became a honey
,Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
,Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
,I only wanted a taste of your lips
,Lips became your body, nights turning to naughty
,You hit me with a plot twist
,Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy
,I might drive fast, but don't slow dance
,I fuck all night, I don't really fuck with romance
,I might be hands on, but I never hold hands
,Since you came into my world
,I had to leave that in the past tense
,Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,All my life I've been a player, player, player
,But I don't wanna play no more
,I guess that's the effect you got on me
,Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
,For the one I was before
,I guess that's the effect you got on me

,Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
,Baby, turn me up, baby, turn me up
,It was only one night, I was in and out
,How the fuck I fall in love? How I fall in love?
,Yeah, she got inside
,She built a brand new house in my mind
,And damn, she already close with my moms
,I couldn't even kick her out if I tried
,Oh, I had it figured out
,How'd she shoot me down?
,Now she's moving in
,Ah, shit
,Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
,I always thought it would only be one kiss
,One became a honey
,Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
,Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
,I only wanted a taste of your lips
,Lips became your body, nights turning to naughty
,You hit me with a plot twist
,Bridge: Marc E. Bassy
,See, I've never been in love
,But I've never been opposed to it
,I never really thought I'd ever get this close to it
,Where do we take a chance?
,You wanna make a go for it
,'Cause now you come into my world
,I'll chase you 'round the globe for it
,Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,All my life I've been a player, player, player
,But I don't wanna play no more
,I guess that's the effect you got on me
,Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
,For the one I was before
,I guess that's the effect you got on me
,Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
,I always thought it would only be one kiss
,One became a honey
,Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
,Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
,I only wanted a taste of your lips
,Lips became your body, nights turning to naughty
,You hit me with a plot twist
,Outro: Marc E. Bassy
,I never thought it would end up like this
,I always thought it would only be one kiss
,One became a honey
,Oh, all of a sudden, I'm singing, "I love you"
,Plot twist, never thought it would end up like this
,I only wanted a taste of your lips

,Summer Is Over
,新浪微博 @harry鲍
,Autumn never seemed this cold before
,Here I am sleeping on the floor
,We changed just like the leaves
,Outside my house
,And my phone lay silent by the couch
,
,I remember June
,Back when I met you
,And your eyes were green
,And we were, too
,
,But summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,And we knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
,'Cause summer is over
,
,I can still see your silhouette
,In the white hot sand
,Still feel my ring on your hand
,The clock was always ticking down
,Behind that glass
,Singing “love, be good while you last”
,
,But we both knew
,What we were getting into
,The things we said
,Sounded true
,
,But summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,And we knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss
,goodbye to the lovers
,’Cause summer is over
,
,The distant innocence
,We are leaving far behind
,Your last words will be burning in my mind
,In the winter time
,
,Well summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,I knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye
,goodbye
,
,Summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,And we knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town

,You got a way of making me feel insane
,Like I can't trust my own brain
,Unless it's screaming your name
,I'd have it no other way
,I'd have it no other way
,And maybe that's why I stay
,How many times can we pick up the same fight?
,Can we keep screaming all night?
,And make up until it's light?
,That's when I say that you're right
,And feel your body on mine
,Oh, maybe that's why I stay
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,Keep coming back
,Guess you can say I'm attached
,Last time we called it a wrap
,I came begging and all that
,You're like a habit, it's bad
,I gotta have it, it's bad
,Oh no, I'm not even mad, no
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,It's the way you keep me up all night
,It's the way you make me lose my mind
,Every time I'm saying one more night
,It's the way you know I'm yours
,It's the way you know I'm yours for life
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,
, We can take an Uber to the beach, babe
, Got a little seasick riding the waves
, Maybe take a trip up the mountains
, Get a little fresh air, eyeing the trees
,
, But pardon me, I know I'm being forward
, Really want you to be my lover
, 'Cause I cannot hide it and
, I don't wanna fight it anymore
,
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, 'Cause you come and you go and
, You never let me know when you come back
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, So won't you stay here?
,
, We can make a movie in the desert
, Nothing but your T-shirt on, on
, We can chase the Sun up on his elbow
, Watching all the clouds go by, go by
,
, But pardon me, I know I'm being forward
, (I'm being forward, baby)
, Really want you to be my lover(really want to)
, 'Cause I cannot hide it and
, I don't wanna fight it anymore
,

,twelve hundred ways that you showed me
,how I can be the one for you and still be the old me
,a pair of you and a mixer, trinity holy,
,in your arms is where I want to rest solely
,the video of you getting down on a kitchen table
,turned me on as a sprung teenager
,rugged yet sleek in figure
,built tough on the bottom and silver on top,
,you were magnetic not a belt drive
,should I go at 33 or 45,
,spinning platter like a mirror ball on a stage live
,I wanted to get to know you inside and out
,turned me into somebody that wants to feel you
,everyday in my sight, even when I sleep tight
,I can picture you in my dreams alright only
,if I could get my hands on a set, good night
,twelve hundred ways that you showed me
,how I can be the one for you and still be the old me

,over the years, I watched you grow up
,mark2, a young model when I first met you
,when we got close you let me pick your brain
,flipped you over and you didn't complain
,i was amazed how you were so grounded,
,touched your colorful wires, and sounds bled,
,thin like capillaries, burned circuit I replaced it
,soldered ends that were meant to be
,copious amount of screws on the wooden floor
,I know you let me in where others wouldn't tour
,around like some clowns but you knew that I'm legit
,sealed you up and now you're ready for the hits
,twelve hundred ways that you showed me
,how I can be the one for you and still be the old me
,a pair of you and a mixer, trinity holy,
,in your arms is where I want to rest solely
,I heard they stopped making you a while ago
,cut you off the assembly line and in catalogs and still strongly
,pursued on the market like online dating
,servicing billion of records that are waiting to be slapped on
,and the needle to be played and be scratched on
,like all digi everything you gotta be kidding me, right
,how can they replace thee?
,I mean a moving disc with a piece of plastic
,putting a scooter ahead of a sedan
,the young guns don't know any better cuz
,once they get to spend a day with you, hot damn
,twelve hundred ways that you showed me
,how I can be the one for you and still be the old me

,Tonight after you were gone
,I thought a lot
,About you
,And how you've been treating me
,And I thought
,Why do I love you?
,
,Living with the memory in the glass
,Everything is so white in the past
,Cant see, everything I try to be
,Just ends up failing in front of me
,
,Brown hair, brown eyes
,You can’t compare someone’s soul by size
,So I’m living with the floorboards
,Buried with our childhood lies
,
,Out by the back were our dog used to sing
,Place me next to him
,Well never speak of this again.
,
,I found lust in petty smiles
,I got lost in you for awhile
,The ghost by the chair
,Looking at us still pulling out my hair
,I was the residence of your bed
,The emotions you never fed
,Even at this point in life
,My psychiatrist says I was better off dead
,
,So little birch, come grow on my spine
,Be the one who says you’ll always be mine
,But the fire inside, never burns that bright
,Dim with the shadows, a soul not in sight
,
,Being a wall flower is far from new to me
,Its blasphemy thinking this is what love could be
,Suicidal thoughts creeping up the back my neck
,Hanging the noose with good intentions and a welfare check
,
,Maybe I’ve just been wishing too much
,Maybe I’ve just been wishing
,
,Living with the memory in the glass
,Everything is so white in the past
,Cant see, everything I try to be
,Just ends up failing in front of me
,
,Brown hair, brown eyes
,You can’t compare someone’s soul by size
,So I’m living with the floorboards
,Buried with our childhood lies
,
,Ill park in the drive way
,Where this rain never seems to end
,Flooded gutters, flooded eyes
,Stories of a time when we can mend
,But seriously since when did anxiety become too much to swallow
,My back burner is burning a hole
,Straight through my bones leaving me hollow
,
,I guess I’m just calling
,Just to say I’ve been thinking a lot lately
,With dreams of dying
,I was stupid to think that you would change me
,I became used to breathing nicotine
,Every time our lips seem to touch
,I guess this is a stretch
,But black lungs never really meant much.
,
,I never did really mean that much did I
,I never really meant that much to you.

,
,Album: Before And After Science(1976)
,Here we are stuck by this river
,You and I underneath a sky
,That's ever falling down down down
,Ever falling down
,Through the day as if on an ocean
,Waiting here always failing to remember
,Why we came came came
,I wonder why we came
,music:
,You talk to me as if from a distance
,And I reply with impressions chosen
,From another time time time
,From another time.

作词 : Brown, Criss, Gist ...
Oh finally, finally(Here we are)
And for good, are the three, follow me(It ain't far)
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are?(There they are)
A devil with the dorags be walkin', now 
I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw(The Nature's back for),
Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbour
Freeze the 
MC's that wanna see thee
By now Naughty 
By Nature by me
They want me to come and come up faster, that could be arranged
Dump the last of the matinee, 'cos they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line
Bite the head off a snake
Chew up from the first to last break and shoot 'em in the face make way(Move)
Who are you to test me?
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me
Wassup? Cuddle sport, here's a thought(The only records that they got, are the records their crew bought)
Damn real 
B rock, get fienin', spunky
Pin the tail on the donkey,
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I do more poppin' than a blockhead, wreck the wax-heads, 
I'm fed(Go ahead, you retired tack-head)
Back to the fact of the track witta new thought
You couldn't smoke butts witta match and a 
NewportHere we go, we go, we go again, witta flow we know, we know it's in(Def play like Poppa Simpson)
KayGee's on the slice, can he coclean?
Doin' more scratchin' than a funk and a dope fiend
Go knock the blocks off, get your props off
But don't cop off, cop out, and 
I'll cuts off
Another renegade of rap will stop that
I'm more feared than a 
Sugar Hill contract
I'm known for 
Lettin' The 
Hos Go, my demo's all flow
When cursin' was a nono, you dodo
Give it up cos 
I'm hot witta warm hate
I won't stop, pop, 'til that head is screwed on straight
I take shorts, and no sorts, so take that clone
The only thing 
I take is the 8 to the path home
And I take you all the way to the north stop
Your style's more foul than a pork chop
I rock the hip-hop, nonstop ticktock
Around the big clock, witta spot, ticktock
Pin the tail on the jackass, it don't mean jack(Chill)
To a brother from down the hill
Back track with a rap that remains funky(Hmm, and it's ugh)
Back in the day, y'all, 
I played with playdough
The dough is real now, and dildo's feel how
A starvin' hungry 
MC gets when
MC , your own is the big sin
I'm starvin' up, it's time ta, call them up, yup
Get 'em and cut 'em up, stuff 'em and cook the duck
Tough luck, tell 'em to shut up and jet
And feel the threat of a real life roughneck
Pin the tail on the donkey,(Check check, where you, where you at, at?)
That another best will need a hard vest for this head check)(What? There's another, Treach?)
That's what 
I heard, yep
Three steps from a pit, boom, in his chest
I never knew a nigga really wanted to die
Instead he bit, instead of lookin' me eye-to-eye, then 
IKnew he was truly thru, dumb plus the one
To meet the mighty one, call a bad one
I rhyme about what 
I want to, microphone 12
You're doin' like , then a bomb do
The MC of 
RHP to L double ok
At, in the ninetie, or watch me 
SCAnd I might top to step to a sexy
Fancy, prancy and dancy
No cosmo stomp, her's the true form
Style's so fat, it gets fitted with a shoe horn
Here's a clearer mirror, dear ya
Lookin' in nearer, 'cos 
I don't fear ya
Some get too souped to the point
Where it's still too thick but still lick thru and thru
Always wanted a guy to come and try
To get sly and try ta, get by my
Hideous, treacherous style that's wreckin' it
Pin the tail on the donkey

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)
Ring the alarm, I don't wanna stay calm cause
I'm about to rip this psalm
When the mic is gripped my lyrics do split up like
Bombs from Vietnam
Cause I'm sweet, neat, I don't romp or skinteet
Lyrics I lick with my tongue
And rhymes I nymn with my teeth
This lyrical prophet you can't stop this from the West Indies
You can tell I'm a lyrical prophet from the words spoken and broken up
In these books and scrolls that I unfold
The knowledge I use does make me bold
The intelligence in my system
Converts itself and becomes wisdom
Born in Trinidad, not Tobogo, land of steel pan and calypso
Cyop is a buck and a buck is a cyop
That's the real true thing and a natural fact
This lyrical man you can't hold me back
From the red, the white, and also the black
Island, which is my land, my place of birth
You can tell by the tongue that's swung
And the lyrical structure in me verse
So all MC's don't cross this border
Cause by now you should know sort of
Lyrically wise but now I despise
All youth that's out of order
Don't try to test any of the Schnikens
Cause I'm not done with the lyrical boxin'
The beatin' and the lickin'
Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)
You two-facety, you can't face me
And my rhymes you'll bite and learn
Soon you'll acknowledge my lyrical substance just like a bookworm
Chip FU, then you will extend and show all the youth them
That me big boutcha under roots and culture
And the bad bull in the pen
Because when I grip the mic (yes, man)
All MC's they do stop yes and hush
Any mic I touch, any mic I brush, any mic I clutch
With these lyrical styles of such
And if I do unleash a lyrical masterpiece
Lyrics never cease, then a piece I'll unleash and make it brief
Please don't bite yes or thief
C-H-I-P FU is my name, it will stay just the same
Give me any mic on stage in a rage I'll engage
And drop rhymes just the same
Quote for quote, note for note, did you comphrehend
So jack it up and pull it up operator
Wheel and come again
Cause MC's try these rastafarianic raps and sound like wanna-be's
But a wanna-be's not what I want to be
See the FU-Schnickens have to be
The true prophets free
Free to preach FU-Schnick prophecies
We thee untouchable, matchable, stoppable MC's for unity
Me, a rastafarian, no not me but I do stun
I'm not faking Jamacian, so all MC's you better run
Because Mr. Chip FU man a come
And me sitdong pon de riddim sitdong pion de vibes
A de hartical don
True me full up a style and me wicked and wild
With peer pattern watch how me chat it in a verb
And capsize it in a noun
Uno better give I and I respect
When this Trinidadian I come
Sing out
Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)
Phenomenon one, phenomenon two, phenomenon three
Come follow me
POC FU's the rough-neck chicken and I'm the wild Apache
See I'm the C the H the I the P
Down with the P the O the C, the K the U the N the G
The M the O, yes and the C
And when the M the I the C is in my H the A-N-D
I preach and teach and educate all ghetto youth about unity
But wait, let me get set not to sweat
But to get something straight
All MC's come out with good styles
And all of them do sound great
But ring the alarm and don't stay calm
Because I won't procrastinate
These lyrical styles that I compile
To preach and teach and educate me
A new jack brother (who's that)
When you were at the parties rapping and scratching I did a chat
On tape, on tape and cassette, you'll hear me live and direct
Yes and who never hear me yet when you hear my voice it's perfect
So just pack up because your lyrics are weak when you speak
Don't step so just back up, wake up, take off the make-up
The mic because I'll break up
MC's limbs from limb, slim me trim
You see me, I don't follow no style and I don't follow no pattern
So take head to this lesson I bring or the lesson I brought
Which was taught to one and another
All slack MC's better ring the alarm
In other words, run for cover

"I am pleased, to have the opportunity to discuss,
your new gun with you."
,
I heard you had beef on your block
so you bought you a Glock, the one with the 17 shots
Nicknamed Smith & Wesson
Gonna teach them punks on your blocks a little lesson
But, who you gon' shoot with that, homey?
You'd rather blast an original instead of a phony
Chewin' macaroni, you don't even know me
And why does your gun say, 'Niggaz only'?
But you need to get an angle on an anglo
I mean shoot your bucks at the Ku Klux
Got your gat, but you ain't thinkin of 'em
'Cause deep inside, I know you love 'em
Point your gat at me and I'll blast ya
But first I gotta ask ya..
Fool, who you talkin to?
What you gotta ask me?
,
But first I gotta ask ya..
,
Who ya gonna who ya gonna shoot wit that, punk?
Who ya gonna shoot wit that, punk?
Who ya gonna who ya gonna shoot wit that, punk?
Yo man, whassup with the jack move fool?
I ain't got no money man!
What you aimin' that pistol at me for man?
Ay man, why don't you go on with that?
Go up to Beverly Hills or somethin
"I am pleased, to have the opportunity to discuss,
your new gun with you."
,
I'm drivin down the street, and I ain't got much more than you
but you still wanna jack for my six-two
Impala, it's all about the dollar
You claim you're gonna bust if I holler
Don't say nuttin as I jump out
But why you gotta blast me, before you stomp out?
Start runnin' cause I'm terrified
Two shots from his gat made me realize
You woulda let me through if I was a caucasian
a jew or an asian
But I see you wanna do me, do me
Is it 'cause, I'm black as you be?
Don't talk about a rep to me
'Cause deep inside, I know you're white as a deputy
Sold my car and bought a brand new gat
Punk, but who you gon' shoot with that?
Chorus + J-Dee (line 4)
,
I hope they find your ass dead in a trunk!
"I am pleased, to have the opportunity to discuss,
your new gun with you."
Hey yo man, I just got jacked man
They always talkin that black on black crime man
I'm fin' to go put in some work man
"I am pleased, to have the opportunity to discuss,
your new gun with you."
,
Now it's time to trip
This fool done caught me slippin and he jacked me
I'm off to the house to take my pistol and my khakis
Never ever thought I would get, got
So I grabbed the fo'-fo' with the thirteen shots
Hunted him down like an animal
Caught his ass slippin with a scadalous hoe
I crept up behind him, put my hands around his mouth
Fo'-fo' to the dome, yo punk we breakin' out
I ducked in the alley off the boulevard
Jumped in the back, trailed by one car
I'm thinkin to myself I can't kill him he's a brother
even though he keeps robbin, and stealin from my mother
He's lookin in my eyes, he's gazin at my gat
And then he said, "Who you gon' shoot with.." {*BLAM*}

, 作词 : Anselm, Dechalus, Kirkland ...
,Verse 1
,Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies
,The highs at all of these industry shing-dings
,Where you see the pretty girls
,In the high animated world
,Checkin' for a rapper with all the dough
,If you take a shit they want to know
,And if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all
,So you still wanna do the show business?
,And you think that you got what it takes?
,I mean you really gotta rap and be all that
,And prepare yourself for the breaks
,Check it out!
,Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
,The ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)
,Always gettin' fronted on at shows (The Business)
,People gotta stick their nose (In the Business)
,Verse 2
,(Q-Tip)
,Yo, I gotta speak on the cesspool
,It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool
,Only if you're on stage, but if you're speakin' to your people
,Ain't no-one your equal
,Especially on the industry side
,Don't let the games just glide
,Right through your fingers, you gotta know the deal
,So Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...
,(Lord Jamar)
,They're givin' you the business and puttin' on a show
,You're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough
,But you got a ho tickets backstage to a show
,Sedated and at that fact they elated
,Time pass and your ass say "Where's my loot?"
,The reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
,All you wanna do is taste the fruit
,But in the back they're makin' fruit juice
,You ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label
,Not able cuz you signed at the table
,For a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance
,That you didn't recoup, more soup wit' ya meal?
,Cos this is the real when you get a record deal
,And I say...
,(Phife)
,Aw....shucks, look what the cat hauled in
,It's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin
,Like Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind
,'bout these no-talent artists gettin' signed, they can't rhyme
,And if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers
,Goin' out like suckers, motherfuckers
,Feel it's time that I let loose the lion
,And if not that then I'll commence to head flyin'
,Seems in '91 everybody want a rhyme
,And then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?
,Please nigga, I've worked too hard for this
,No more will I take the booty end of the stick
,Bogus brothers makin' albums when they know they can't hack it
,Cuz they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets
,Now tell me I can't tear it up
,Go get yourself some toilet paper cuz your lyrics is butt
,Do you wanna be in the business? (The Business)
,People can't walk a straight line in (The Business)
,Some of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)
,A-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)
,Verse 3
,(Sadat X)
,The party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same
,You see the same faces, but at different places
,When you're up and ridin' high everything is palsy-palsy
,Get a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs
,Well that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag
,Prefer to max on the side and let my pants sag
,"Oh, he's a cutie", yeah, real cute
,But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot
,Although I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs
,So fuck what you heard
,The born cipher, cipher master makes me think much faster
,But critics still continue to plaster
,My name and discredit my fame
,All that shit is game
,And I don't really give a damn
,Eat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham
,(Diamond D)
,Well, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in
,Don't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in
,A matter of minutes so it must be told
,All that glitters' not gold
,Everybody wants a deal, help me make a demo
,See my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo
,My moms keeps beefin' ("Boy, get a job")
,But I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam
,Huh, well it's not that easy
,You gotta get a label that's willin' and able
,To market and promote, and you better hope
,(For what?) That the product is dope
,Take it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbin'
,When it comes to rhymin' you gotta put your time in
,Get a good lawyer so problems won't pile
,You don't wanna make a pitch that's wild

, 作曲 : James Sheppard/William Miller
,You're my love you're my angel
,You're the girl of my dreams
,I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently
,Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
,
,How I've waited for this moment
,To be by your side
,Your best friend wrote and told me
,You had teardrops in your eyes
,Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
,
,It wasn't on a sunday (monday and tuesday went by)
,It wasn't on a tuesday afternoon (all I could do was cry)
,But I made a promise that you treasured
,I made it back home to you
,How I've waited for this moment
,To be by your side
,Your best friend wrote and told me
,You had teardrops in your eyes
,Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
,Daddy's home to stay
,I'm not a thousand miles away
,
,Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
,With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
,A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
,
,But if me and a certain character met
,That guy that invented the cigarette
,I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
,
,That ain't that I don't smoke myself
,And I don't reckon they'll harm your health
,I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
,
,But nicotine slaves are all the same
,At a pettin' party or a poker game
,Everythin's gotta stop when they have that cigarette
,
,Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
,Puff puff puff
,And if you smoke yourself to death
,Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate
,That you hate to make him wait
,But you just gotta have another cigarette
,
,Now at a game of chance the other night
,Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
,Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
,
,Well I got a full and I bet it high
,But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
,He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down

,忙碌的人
,演唱者：龙胆紫
,
,来来回回早出晚归
,手忙脚乱又忙碌的人们
,干了这杯
,
,接着想着一辈子
,都认识了谁
,离开了错误但谁靠近了对
,可是重复再重复
,让他们麻木
,
,挖了一个B奴车奴房奴的坟墓
,欠的太多了还不清了
,谁也不能停
,所有忙碌的人
,我对你表示同情
,
,日出而作就习惯了保持沉默
,日落而息才敢脱下外衣
,抓紧时间被利用被浪费
,先学习后工作去排个长队
,
,每天天还没亮他们就开始忙
,还有几个没睡的得扛到天亮
,可我着不了那急也真等不了
,吃完早点接着回家睡觉
,
,看看我的大街小巷换了个样
,得了吧真没您那么大的面儿
,看看路上我问您
,那些人都来自哪儿
,你可以选择开车可必须踩个点儿
,
,没错儿去他妈的上班儿上课
,去他妈的早起排队堵车
,那些人每天走着相同的路
,辛苦的忙碌为了所谓的幸福
,
,忙碌的人在按照计划想着办法
,为了收获疯狂的付出代价
,可贫穷的重复的生活
,简单又快乐
,复杂又寂寞酸甜苦辣
,
,如果你现在还年轻
,别为了钱玩儿命
,在你做梦的时候
,关了你的闹铃儿
,
,我们最根本的本性
,不是善与恶
,而是回避痛苦
,追求快乐
,可你别忘了
,什么能做什么不能做
,
,现在张开你的嘴巴
,跟我一起说
,说没错儿
,说去你妈的
,我现在太累了
,想不想卷一个
,请忙碌的人
,尊重自然的选择
,
,着急地想快点儿
,享受地想慢点儿
,有时候站在中间
,寻找两端
,有人已经当了老板
,有的睡在车站
,有人造了很多孽
,还有人吃不上饭
,新盖了几栋楼
,又做了几笔生意
,换了新的看门儿狗和
,够劲儿的小蜜
,
,有人不偷不抢
,不干净的不敢想
,于是城市里的程序化
,删除了梦想
,难道一上一下
,从左到了右
,都有责任和欠的债
,让你承受
,
,记住每时每刻
,每分每一秒
,不要忘记过去
,现在继续创造着
,如果真实的声音
,让你感觉可靠
,
,当你听到的时候说
,它就是你想要的
,两个闲不住的人
,一首关于你的歌儿
,我们不该有区别
,本来都差不多
,
,我们最根本的本性
,不是善与恶
,而是回避痛苦
,追求快乐
,可你别忘了
,什么能做什么不能做
,
,现在张开你的嘴巴
,跟我一起说
,说没错儿
,说去你妈的
,我现在太累了
,想不想卷一个
,请忙碌的人

,跟着来自心跳的节奏
,漫步在黄金年代的街头
,Purple Soul and loop
,龙胆紫再次带你回到内时候的flow
,说实话谋杀了人的思想强制洗脑之后的伟大领袖
,统治我的祖国熟悉的梦带着光划过眼前
,直到窗外的噪音打扰了我的睡眠你发现
,我也发现了你所有经历遭遇的和我相同相似的在想的问题
,这么大的地球自由的人受委屈
,贪得注入苦海下面是地狱别装逼
,谁想去你离开我继续得把注意力转移
,翻来覆去考虑想化解自私与矛盾被误会滋养的根
,得罪的装的真的藏的深的像针
,谁怕被扎破了除非你是玩了命的时代机器
,还在得意着保了密的劳动积蓄不可操之过急
,这个社会主义目的让你骗了自己
,新的开始 keep underground loop
,别冲动这不是你最想走的路
,在城市里被现实打败的过程
,自以为是与众不同可谁知道疼
,这种态度 Purple Soul在保护
,DJ MC涂鸦和你的舞步
,自然紫色的疗伤药水儿治你的疼
,除非你伤口干燥的已经化脓
,还是按老规矩keep fire burning
,点燃Jah的火焰燃烧巴比伦的城市
,如果无耻已经成为你生活的方式
,那么我想让你看看什么才是活的真实
,每个身上的伤疤都代表着什么
,别拿出来炫耀了好吗至少你现在还活着
,可能最疼的感觉你早就已经忘了
,但是我保证还有更新的良心说唱
,龙胆紫来自自然生活在城市
,根儿在地下家在ghetto混在街头
,在内时候我没有别的选择只有拳头
,但是我现在举起拳头是为了自由
,紫色灵魂帮你止血消毒
,给你一个伤疤是为了让你以后记住
,当爱的力量大过于对力量的爱
,这个世界将会和平你才会感到自由
,站在自己的hoodI represent my crew
,江湖人士过河卒，路是不归路
,所有兄弟们都清楚但没办法这是我们自己选择的路
,那好吧original soldier keep fire
,这是我们的cypher 兄弟们都在这儿
,你看看他们身上哪个还没点儿伤呢
,哪个不是天天希望自己兜里揣把枪就像
,我们的说唱能够以柔克刚
,先花了你的概念再乱了你的气场
,这些伤留在心里让你不能痊愈
,就像我们的简历上面儿写着进过监狱
,都是受过伤的经历了太多悲剧
,谁不想变强壮好面对过去
,无法逃避的我们需要keep it real
,听听新的节奏这就是purple soul
,像是一种染料改变了原来的lifestyle
,或者说是一种药
,没有任何毒性没有任何副作用放在我的伤口上还能防止化脓
,谁都知道大的道理大家谁都懂但遇事儿就犯懵好了伤疤忘了疼
,我们可以不尊重自己的身体
,但别忘了最深的伤口是在心里
,这是新的开始keep underground loop
,别冲动这不是你最想走的路
,在城市里被现实打败的过程
,自以为是与众不同可谁知道疼
,这种态度 Purple Soul在保护

梧桐把自然光遮蔽地剩下一些斑点

街边的法式建筑已经爬满藤蔓

下雨的时候，来来往往看不真切的过客

听不见我外面冰冷内里炽热的节奏

6路公交站台，我抛开雨伞

手指在空气中跳着舞
,Do you recall, not long ago
,We would walk on the sidewalk
,Innocent, remember?
,All we did was care for each other
,But the night was warm
,We were bold and young
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,What will we do when we get old?
,Will we walk down the same road?
,Will you be there by my side?
,Standing strong as the waves roll over
,When the nights are long
,Longing for you to come home
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...

,It was the year
,I didn’t check the terms and conditions of your heart, dear
,You wrote out your song that swept into the summer of it all
,It was the time your momma warned us all you were gone
,She told me love had ﬁxed you, turned you wrong
,That winter you were calling out your song
,Song, oh
,
,You know I want the best in you
,Hey, boy, give me back your love

,
,To let go of all the weight

,I don't know why I feel this way
,
,Everything should feel right
,
,Starving for that big, hot sun
,
,Just can't find the light
,
,The days, they keep on passing
,
,And I can't catch my train
,
,I feel like a passenger whose ride never came

,…I am sitting  din din din……
,I am sitting in the morning
,At the diner on the corner
,I am waiting at the counter
,For the man to pour the coffee
,And he fills it only halfway
,And before I even argue
,He is looking out the window
,At somebody Coming in
,
,"It is always nice to see you"
,Says the man behind the counter
,To the woman who has come in
,She is shaking her umbrella
,And I look the other way
,As they are kissing their hellos
,I'm pretending not to see them
,Instead I pour the milk
,
,I open up the paper
,There's a story of an actor
,Who had died while he was drinking
,It was no one I had heard of
,And I'm turning to the horoscope
,And looking for the funnies
,When I'm feeling someone watching me
,And so I raise my head
,Da da da le da da da le……

,Turn away, walk alone
,Watch my body turn to stone
,I need to know, where is your heart?
,Just so I can find my own
,Can we make peace?
,You keep pushing me around
,But you just get me somehow
,Like the stars in the sky
,It's certain to be seen
,That I would like to make you mine
,We're heading down this road
,And I don't know where it leads
,But I will learn to love you in time
,And we'll wait for the sun
,When you've got flowers in your hands
,You've picked the petals one by one
,Just to find out where you stand
,You've been running from the smoke
,But you've been caught up by the flame
,Falling headfirst through the dark
,When everything just seems to change
,When everything just seems to change
,When everything just seems to change
,When everything just seems to change
,When everything just seems to change
,Be the tremble in my arms, be the air within my lungs
,Be the ground beneath my feet so I can stand
,The words we both speak are getting lost within our cheeks
,Like they were written in the sand
,With your arms around my neck
,And your hands upon my chest
,I get this feeling that never goes away
,And while we're stuck here falling
,There's water out there calling
,And I've been building my own ship to sail away
,And we'll wait for the sun
,When you've got flowers in your hands
,You've picked the petals one by one
,Just to find out where you stand
,You've been running from the smoke
,But you've been caught up by the flame

Eu sei e voce sabe
Que o amor
Tem o seu momento
De briga e dor
Mais o que importa
e ver voce sorrir
Depois fazer as pazes
Namorar
Eu tenho um grande amor
Por ti, meu bem
Perdoa as vezes a minha insensatez
Venha, vamos andar
a beira mar, e ver!
A lua se mostrou
Eu sou so tua
Mais o que importa
E ver voce sorrir
Depois fazer as pazes
Namorar

Eu sou so tua
A lua se mostrou
Quando a noite vem...
Leva-me pra Lua
Quero ficar entre as estrelas
Deixa-me voar
Em direção a este lugar Dá-me tuas mãos Vem comigo Vem me encontrar Nesta viagem
Leva-me pra onde
O amor exista de verdade
Onde a felicidade
Só procure por nós dois Em outras palavras
Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Leva-me pra Lua Quero ficar entre as estrelas Deixa-me voar
Em direção a este lugar
Dá-me tuas mãos
Vem comigo Vem me encontrar Nesta viagem Leva-me pra onde O amor exista de verdade Onde a felicidade Só procure por nós dois Em outras palavras Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Em outras palavras Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Fly me tô the moon, And let me play among the stars.

,它是我的最爱
,它流进脑海 永远放不开
,丢不下它存在
,慢慢住在心怀
,内容说个大概
,其他的你去猜
,我减慢车速 今天的心情
,是灰色或像夜色是黑的
,我摇上车窗 隔离了世界
,放空在小空间藏匿着
,不诚实的城市变幻从无预告
,视线中他出现在记忆的拐角
,霓虹街道的人流唯他黑白
,嘴中碎念没人能懂的对白
,落地橱窗的光 洒在他脸上
,捕捉他那瞬息万变的神态
,他解开了扣子 慌忙 擦去了汗
,也许这变幻 的都市他难以喘气
,他怀疑这城市也怀疑着自己
,擦肩又回 头会 下位 是谁
,这街上 的一切 像按了循环键
,耸了耸肩 他远离了视线
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方
,今天的心情是红色还是橙 色
,夜晚戴上全黑new era的款式
,出门右转的橱窗点亮了彻夜
,走过匆匆 人流只看到疲倦的侧面
,他解开一颗扣子看了看手表
,擦去了汗珠终于放松了手脚
,也许是约会的forever love
,也许是转折却不确定这love
,谁猜 测 他的开 心来自等待
,送给心爱的人 一杯仙草冻奶
,将要拥抱的感觉像是中彩
,灰白的都市 唯他拥有色彩
,他怀疑这城市坚持自己
,品尝那份执着尽管诱惑闪烁
,我咬着吸管刚才被冷落
,耸了耸肩他远离了视线
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方
,我走向街角 我驶向街角
,一辆车向我驶来 一人向我走来
,夜色已深无人的街道我试着打车
,夜色已深的街道有人朝我招手
,车门开了 我载你一程吧
,刚才街上有个人跟你很像
,难道我们不都匆忙成一样
,是的但是他总在嘀咕着什么
,或许是压力 或是甜蜜的烦恼
,是等待约会 或许在游荡
,他怀疑着城市坚持着自己（怀疑）
,他在都市的舞台上找到了自己（迷失)
,有人到达了 有人迷路了
,有人不敢去 有人不畏惧
,耸了耸肩 我们远离了视线
,对视一眼 哈 他就是我们自己
,U180 白天不亮 树
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方

,I can see the purple rain

,somewhere inside us is getting beautiful
,we're too easily lose touch with
,the better and softer ourselves
,somewhere inside us we were looking for
,somewhere inside us we called it flaming youth
,I could be your patience baby
,I could be your mountains baby
,I can never treat you like an invader

,我们都有问题 都很难入睡
,我们都有问题 造成很多误会
,我们都有问题 围绕着是非
,我们都不知道怎麽处理我们的问题
,我们很像 都说我们没有问题
,也都坚持我们不一样
,隔着防备 却不知不觉被影响
,其实 我只想对你讲
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题
,我们知道自己弱点 但说得坚强
,一道道证明题 都解得牵强
,但为了阐述我的理想 激昂地演讲
,也为了攻破你 用力地回想
,我们那些很扯的过去
,成为彼此批判的字句
,用我的秩序镇压 是党的胜利
,战火烧过之後 剩下仿的正义
,不同的个体 不同的灵魂
,却总要对方了解自己 特别是情人
,我们的争吵 已是不红的新闻
,我们让嘴用来伤人 不重视亲吻
,针锋相对的刺蝟 潇洒的话是自卫
,我们的智慧 是没法为彼此交换位置
,一直只想对峙 忘了尊严和面子是两回事
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题
,是什麽一点一点累积 越来越不能忍耐
,一点一点消逝 一刻也不能等待
,越来越没默契 错误的翻译
,就连玩笑都被解释成责怪
,原本 能笑看对方超越自己底线
,渐渐 却像是睫毛掉进眼睛里面
,当冷漠不断扩张在爱恨之间
,最後 两个熟识的人就从此失联
,所以当我们已经对着不同角落放空
,我只想让我们关系善终
,让我们不受情绪搧动
,用理智收起一些放纵
,即使不能欢送彼此
,让我们想起初衷 不是比较 是微笑
,不是计较着 把什麽赔掉
,笑着接受 缘份是难以预料的
,不管被加入还是去掉了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过(SL:那些到底算是谁的错) 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过(SL:那些到底算是谁的错) 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话(SL:那些只是气话其实我) 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题

,如今的自己不再竹篮打水一场空
,不再幻想把所有的付出与实际行动
,也知道完成梦想其实它真的并不轻松
,渐渐看看自己 在这里一天天地长大
,也看着父母的头上长出了一根根的白发
,那瞬间 我不禁把头低下
,从那以后 我开始和他们认真地说话
,记不清从何时喜欢懒洋洋的冬天

,如果有谁觉得时间走得慢
,可以把箭装进一颗蛋,拿一个碗
,本来射向人间的灯火阑珊
,却变成一束月光照在日上三竿
,还是觉得慢,慢得扩散
,连你怀里的蛋，都开始捣蛋
,给它一个搅拌
,让它迷乱禁止上街散发传单扰乱治安想推翻
,什么人呢
,他用哪一只手拿筷子
,他能不能够
,和我们一样

,一个月色撩人的早上
,在月色撩人的早上
,打开你的窗帘
,撕碎你自己的脸
,看见你的眼神空洞
,但充满月光的蓝色
,洒满在这城市里的每一个角落
,你骑着自行车
,贴着一片邮票
,在你的手的指梢轻轻巧巧
,你发现你的五官开始错乱
,好像是九大行星运转
,在这里没有任何东西可以抓得住
,好像是你的手指的指纹的命运一样无常
,你也许会马上结婚有马上离婚
,或者马上和另外一个人一起私奔到世界尽头的角落
,如果你觉得那地方非常黑暗
,像一个保险柜的里扳？
,你把密码都忘了
,自己出不去但是这个月亮还是能够穿透你
,你发现你的城市很冷
,有时沙子很多
,眼睛有时很淡
,世界有时很小
,语言有时很差
,这物价这糟糕的物价飞涨着你不知道
,有时不想上班有时也会迟到
,有时打着电脑有时候把自己的T-shrit一件一件撕了
,吐出那口烟雾之后发现
,拉开窗帘这是一个早上
,一个月色撩人的早上
,一个神清气爽的早上
,一个不在地球上的早上
,我和Jeff一起做音乐的早上
,月光洒下了，但是这是一个早上
,因为我们在宇宙中漂浮
,就为我们鼓掌

,朦胧恍惚间的共鸣不止少数我想你也会
,不断 不断挣脱 布满 羁绊的锁
,真真假假错的对的 缠绕旋转 纠葛
,我梦见没有出口的商店 我梦见海浪跨过地平线
,我梦见坠入宇宙最边缘 我梦见混合血液的意大利面
,我梦见没有表情没有面孔一张张脸和我擦过肩
,我梦见光我梦见伤我梦见化尸骨水流往加工厂
,我梦见欲望浸满浴缸撑破家的窗
,我梦见我梦见我梦见做了梦中梦
,梦中的梦是梦中的梦永远记不清的痛
,无尽的痛围绕是怎么走也走不完的楼道
,或许梦醒时分只是短时间的求饶

这是一个开始 和一个新起点
时间滴答滴答我的热情并无削减
虽然钟表 它不停地回到原点
你三 百六十五天原地转了几圈
止步不前 坐井观天 不是我
冲刺抢点那生命线上的自我
加速过 才知道快感就是没输过
困难甚至变成动力加入我
假如说 遇见过客我会轻轻点个头
如果你 跟我一样早起那就握个手
他们消失在站台 你们在台下站着
行驶在赛 道需要你们一旁鼓舞
20几的岁 月还有几年可以挥 霍
霍霍不甘落后永远只做No.2
年轻的圆心 梦想的半径
那未来的无限只管 前进
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep on n on we gotta go
打开了邮箱收到几封私信
怎么讲把心里的话 献给我的至亲 
梦 至今 没有被雪浇得死心 
看到每天一起玩的都是知音 
有时候气力耗尽 你给我加一把力 
i feel so strong像是超级玛丽 
我秘方 goes on 不怕被谁吓唬 
我开始跑 你是否还在原地踏步 
人流之中我庆幸遇到知己 
这段征程没想过拿到大四喜 
我用我的真诚不停留 
每一步他们越喷 我越认真 
前方纵有太多的埋伏 请你跟上好吗 
如果 你一样 那还有谁在怕 
我们击掌 让他们追 只看到背影 
开拓这 穷乡僻壤 根本不靠背景
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep on n on we gotta go
时间在人生中 途他捣乱
物是人非 总是见怪不怪
年少时美妙的朋友有些不再相伴
they make me move on im still here 
感谢hater 口口相传我成佳话
魂斗罗两位大叔向前从没废话
如今他们年迈棒子到我手 另一手
牵着理想 为新的一天欢呼
想到过去的人和事两个字青涩 
过去的陪伴此刻又在和谁亲热 
不用去管夜晚关了灯闭上眼 
转了身又是新的清晨 
得了精神病整个人好精神 
湿过枕巾 曾经也画意诗情 
失禁的信心 背上包我了然确定 
这趟 我离梦想越接近
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
两西：
你会莫名的激动 莫名的哭
想要有扇方便的门随意进出
掺合着愤怒
牵绊着无助
焦虑和吩咐
方式很特别 我正在领悟
更小的细节 衔接着以前
发生的一切 
都是它对你的试验
什么事都会变
直到挣脱这锁链
和真实再相见
的你
看起来更矫健
每次接近都熟悉
感觉是 独一
和被忘记的呼吸
跟她说的对不起
当昨天被翻面了
始终都回不去
像无声音的默剧
循环中规律
你选择等待 
时间和未来
左胸口抚摸着爱
明天更加澎湃
最直接的状态
冲破阴影的障碍
后得到关怀
所有一切
只希望你能明白

,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,对我来说，地球就是一家便利店
,
,门外是再见，你默默抽着烟
,
,我知道你很恨我，而且不是第一次
,
,但我还是笑着发抖，准备给你讲个故事
,
,那是从我的爷爷的爷爷的爷爷就开始的冒险
,
,当女人吹灭蜡烛
,
,就要准备起飞
,
,你想想看，我和你的这座城市
,
,有多少人正在熟睡
,
,梦里说再见
,
,在这样沉醉的晚上
,
,我们疯狂亲吻对方，
,
,可即使是爱情也阻止不了我的幻想
,
,过去拥抱你的手臂
,
,现在用来远离
,
,使劲划着桨
,
,穿透大气层到没有重力的地方
,
,没有水也没有光
,
,没有涂抹防晒霜的心，直接面对太阳
,
,如果命运烧成灰，请你抓住我的彗尾
,
,比岩浆还烫，正好蒸发你的眼泪
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,把一句微小的格言刻在巨大角落
,
,我的母亲河不是黄河，是银河
,
,有一匹牧场上的马喜欢吃星星
,
,只有从太空吹来的风，才能吹动风铃
,
,这些年在地上收获了太多温存之后
,
,你持续的不安来自我的不安分
,
,但我毕竟是我爷爷的爷爷的爷爷的孙子的孙子的孙子
,
,在宇宙中诞生的蛋
,
,相比 律师、记者、作家、银行家
,
,歌手、水手、拳击手、大提琴手
,
,飞行员、保险推销员、注意安全
,
,安全？没有危险，哪来的安全，我险些死于大火
,
,一次次把自己写成情歌
,
,我喜欢打断生活
,
,也喜欢生活被打断的声音
,
,这让我更加渴望
,
,那未知的召唤
,
,哪怕前方无知己的孤独
,
,那是我的星宿
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,跑吧，兔子，跑吧，快跑吧
,
,拼命地挖吧，挖空了太阳
,
,你想活多久，你想飞多高
,
,都是你的奔跑，通往另一个森林
,
,呼吸，呼吸吧呼吸
,
,不要离开，你要离开我的担心
,
,你准备笑出的笑，你准备哭出的哭
,
,都是你的生命，通往另一个坟墓
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次

,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,Like a movie that you can't predict
,Like a book that you can't resist
,I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
,bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
,verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
,with the whole city fast asleep, out cold
,true words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
,of a poet in me, most powerfully
,I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
,It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing,
,trying to find a reason to work, god willing
,I admit, my thinking is wishful
,like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
,how far do we have to stretch the truth
,to fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite
,throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
,on the analog player watch the people glow
,sit back to the breeze and let the memories flow
,comedy tragedy all the highs and lows
,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,Like your moves that I can't predict
,Like your look that I can't resist
,The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
,the lingering appeal was so unusual
,herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
,with the whole body fast asleep, out cold
,true vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
,of a prophet in me most visibly
,I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
,It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing,
,trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
,I admit, our dealing is painful
,like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
,how far do we have to stretch the picture
,before pixelating the human texture
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
,homecoming gathering with a big surprise
,throw on your favorite record that's good to go
,on the analog table and it's hooked to blow
,sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
,hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows
,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,okay we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite
,throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
,on the analog trail and you look the role
,just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
,sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite

,She was a murderess in a million dollar dress
,Far from these haunted shores she went
,She was a billionaire just like the girl with flaxen hair
,A beauty queen from the scene she had been set
,
,Beneath those wide dark eyes
,She was never satsified
,Please Venus lay your head down low
,Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
,When you rise again the dunes will dance
,The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
,O your love has gone but your not alone
,
,So as she left the sands
,A dream boat with hard lock hands
,Fingers full of pearl rings
,Should have seen her shake her tambourine
,And her pride and joy, was her darling boy
,He came invisible and disappeared into the screen
,And beneath those city lights
,Her heart started beating like dynamite
,Please venus lay your head down low
,Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
,When you rise again the dunes will dance
,The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
,O your love has gone but your not alone
,
,And you'll find her at the fairground
,At the end of the pier
,Watching all the ships go by
,With the shell against her ear
,And now she takes her leave
,Cos there's nothing left here to believe
,And she walks beneath the waves once more
,She rides again
,Riding a shell some kind of hollow eve
,And walks upon new golden shore
,And if you see her go ask her where's she's been
,Just kneel and follow the sound of that tambourine
,Please venus lay your head down low
,Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
,When you rise again the dunes will dance
,The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
,Cos your love has gone but your not alone

,生日快乐，我的小怪物。笑觉就算和你的关系如何超越定义还是免不了俗。
,跟刚过去的213天一样在没有你的城市里想念你，我在边界挣扎着不死去的少年。
,想念有你在旁边才会出现的我粉色的灵魂。想念你抱着我的那个夏天。
,那时候，对我来说来说，童子洲就是这世界上最大的地方。
,要知道我会永远为你祝福，但愿你能永远年轻，有漂亮衣服。晚安，小怪物。

,I guess this is a bitter end I didn't see coming
,And I'm havin' a little bit of trouble accepting, too
,I don't know what to say to you
,There's nothing I can do to reset your point of view
,We both said this was just physical
,Well, one of us lied, can't set feelings aside, truth be told, yeah
,You asked to see me once again at half past ten
,I got nervous, so I got faded, made things complicated
,
,I'm sorry for the stupid shit I said
,You ordered fun, I served you threads
,It's probably good you left 'cause I finally admit
,
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Sorry, I never meant to
,But who we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
,One look at you and I wouldn't have it any other way
,I want you, I want you, I want you
,I want you to want me too
,I know that I signed up for this casually
,But I fell for your tricks, now I'm the casualty
,
,Can we just reset, restart and then replay
,Take me back to when all
,You wanted was to love on me every day, yeah
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Words I won't ever hear from you
,Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
,To when I feel your hands on me and your lips on mine
,
,I know that that was too much the last time you saw me
,And I don't blame you for getting over everything so easy
,But I just can't seem to figure you out you goddamn mystery
,Good God, how you kiss me
,Didn't think it'd be distress galore
,Thought I just wanted you there
,With your hands in my hair
,But I craved more
,And you just wanted rock 'n roll, no heart and soul
,And I knew that from the beginning
,So why don't I feel like I'm winning?
,
,Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the joke
,The punchline that got too old
,It's killing me to see you gone 'cause I never told you
,
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Sorry, I never meant to
,But who we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
,One look at you and I wouldn't
,Have it any other way
,I want you, I want you, I want you
,I want you to want me too
,I know that I signed up for this casually
,But I fell for your tricks, now I'm the casualty
,
,Can we just reset, restart and replay
,Take me back to when all
,You wanted as to love on me everyday, yeah
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Words I won't ever hear from you
,Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
,To when I feel your hands on me
,And your lips on mine
,
,Something 'bout you makes me difficult
,But that makes us even 'cause you top of the charts
,Egotistical, it's so typical
,For me to fall for your kind
,But, oh God, I wish you were mine
,
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Sorry, I never meant to
,But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
,One look at you and I wouldn't have it any other way
,I want you, I want you, I want you
,I want you to want me, too
,Would it be a stretch if I asked you to try again?
,I'll be patient, I swear I'll even count to ten
,One, two, three, four, five
,Fuck it
,
,Can we just reset, restart and then replay
,Take me back to when all
,You wanted was to love on me every day, yeah
,I like you, I like you, I like you
,Words I won't ever hear from you
,Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time
,To when "I like you" was only just a secret
,Crime
,
,Yeah, uh
,
, Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
, The kind you'd find on someone that could save
, If they don't put me away
, Well, it'll be a miracle
,
, Do you believe you're missing out?
, That everything good is happening somewhere else
, With nobody in your bed
, The night is hard to get through
,
, And I will die all alone
, And when I arrive I won't know anyone
,
, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
, So what did you do those three days you were dead?
, Because this problem is gonna last
, More than the weekend
,
, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
, But I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
, Do I get the gold chariot?
, Do I float through the ceiling?
,
, Or do I divide and fall apart
, Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
, This ship went down in sight of land
, And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?
,
, I know you're coming in the night like a thief
, But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
, I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
, But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up
, So do you think that we could work out a sign
, So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try
, I know you're coming for the people like me
, But we all got wood and nails
, And we turn out hate in factories
, We all got wood and nails
, And we turn out hate in factories
, We all got wood and nails
, And we sleep inside of this machine
,
,So I think we’ve said all there is to be said
,All the words keep bouncing around in my head
,Oh I feel so numb
,Please just take me home
,Seems like all the talking it took us nowhere
,All I really want is the touch of your hand
,I won’t speak a sound
,If you take me home
,If you hold me close
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,If I start to scream from the top of my lungs
,It would make no difference I’d still be alone
,It would leave you numb
,The words would echo on
,Rockets can be flown all the way to the moon
,So much we can do yet we fail to get through
,To one another me and you
,A traffic jam of words
,Can’t move forward, can’t reverse
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,Silence it will save us
,Making room for our love
,Yes it will
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins

,风里飘散的头发，门外空荡荡的家
,
,从不开始的冬天，从未晴朗的屋檐
,没人教会我想念，烧成灰烬的木棉
,
,我蓝色的降落伞，在天空里那么孤单
,飘向翻涌的人海，望着我被掩埋
,
,那个青涩的男孩，在岁月里那么孤单
,他嘴角的那根烟，忽明忽暗地走远

晴空突然下起了雨 天上的云朵怎么了
  平静湖水泛起浪花 水里的鱼儿怎么了
  喧闹的城市安静了 忙碌的人儿怎么了
  不安的情绪纷乱的心 你到底怎么了

怎么了呀怎么了 你我到底怎么了
  不爱吗留恋吗 就这样散了吗
  怎么了呀怎么了 你我到底怎么了
  哭了吗想了吗 就这样散了吗

从前的我们多快乐 现在的我们怎么了
  放了手却又在拉扯 问问你的心怎么了
  失败了曲终人散了 我对你又能怎么呢
  都懂了却还爱你呐 我的爱怎么了


怎么了呀怎么了 你我到底怎么了
  不爱吗留恋吗 就这样散了吗
  怎么了呀怎么了 你我到底怎么了
  哭了吗想了吗 就这样散了吗

  不爱吗留恋吗 就这样散了吗

,天边夕阳再次映上我的脸庞
,再次映着我那不安的心
,这是什么地方依然是如此的荒凉
,那无尽的旅程如此漫长
,我是永远向着远方独行的浪子
,你是茫茫人海之中我的女人
,在异乡的路上每一个寒冷的夜晚
,这思念它如刀让我伤痛
,总是在梦里我看到你无助的双眼
,我的心又一次被唤醒
,我站在这里想起和你曾经离别情景
,你站在人群中间那么孤单
,那是你破碎的心
,我的心却那么狂野
,
,你在我的心里永远是故乡
,你总为我独自守候沉默等待
,在异乡的路上每一个寒冷的夜晚
,这思念它如刀让我伤痛
,总是在梦里我看到你无助的双眼
,我的心又一次被唤醒
,我站在这里想起和你曾经离别情景
,你站在人群中间那么孤单
,那是你破碎的心
,我的心却那么狂野
,总是在梦里我看到你无助的双眼
,我的心又一次被唤醒
,总是在梦里看到自己走在归乡路上
,你站在夕阳下面容颜娇艳
,那是你衣裙漫飞
,那是你温柔如水

,Dreaming of you when I'm alone
,Baby don't trip I'm coming home, kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
,Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything I want
,This is for you baby listen it's your song
,Oye cariño, solo pienso en ti
,When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep
,How I wish you were mine, I think of you all the time
,I always feel like I'm flying, baby you make me feel fine
,Lost in the words that you say to me y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream
,I'm on the top of the world baby girl can't you see
,I found my perfect girl, I want to make you my queen
,Time and time again I can be feeling real sad, cos mi sueño no se ha hecho una realidad
,Pero el tiempo dirá, el tiempo dirá
,If we go spend our life together en lo que el mundo gira
,I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you and nobody's touch and nobody's lips can make me feel like yours do
,Our hands in a lock, nuestros labios se conocen
,Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa we'll be okay
,Dreaming of you when i'm alone
,Baby don't trip i'm coming home, kick it with me i don't care if the sun is down
,Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything i want
,This is for you baby listen, it's your song
,Sin ti mis días son largos y se sienten tan amargos
,me ahogo en un lago de mis lagrimas que hago
,Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you
,Promise that I'm gonna love you, it's about that time you do
,I swear I don't see nothing but I want to lay here with you
,And I hope you know I miss you, from my head, I can't dismiss you
,Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida, que me falta
,Lo que siento is surreal, i can't lie to you for real
,Sabes bien que te quiero and if you're down to spend your summer with me just let me know
,You know you are my sueño, you came to my life and now I feel alright
,Dreaming of you when I'm alone
,Baby don't trip I'm coming home, kick it with me I don't care if the sun is down
,Baby don't cry when I am gone, promise you are everything I want

,They asked me how I knew
,my true love was true
,I of course replied "something here inside
,cannot be denied"
,They said "someday you'll find
,all who love are blind"
,When your heart's on fire
,you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
,So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
,to think they could doubt my love
,Yet today my love has flown away
,I am without my love
,Now laughing friends deride
,tears I cannot hide
,So I smile and say
,"when a lovely flame dies,
,smoke gets in your eyes"
,smoke gets in your eyes"
,
,The clock has ticked eleven and the place is clear
,Reality is kicking in and so is my beer
,I don't make excuses when it's all my fault
,If a heart is made of money he's cleaned out my vault
,I feel a little wounded and it isn't fair
,To sit inside a parlour and see him standing over there
,As smug as a robber that a cop can't catch
,The lipstick on his collar doesn't seem to match mine
,
,Now Joe behind the bar is offering advice
,
,Cause I'm a broken record and he has to tell me twice
,Why don't I understand that he just can't change
,
,I wanna be his woman not his weekend dame
,
,Now Joe has eyes a'rollin' says it's just too bad
,
,And he'll be back tomorrow for my heartbeat crash
,
,I'd like to say goodbye, but hello is the match
,
,Though the lipstick on his collar never seems to match mine
,
,This line is disconnected
,
,
,Loving you is easy cos`you`re beautiful
,Making love with you is all I wanna do
,Loving you is more than just the dream come true
,And everything that I do is out of loving you
,La La……do do……
,No one else can make me feel
,The colours that you bring
,Stay with me while we grow old
,And we will live each day in springtime
,Cos'Loving you has made my life so beautiful
,everyday of my life is filled with loving you
,Loving you I see your soul
,Come shining through
,And every time that we, Ooh
,I`m more in love with you
,La La……do do……

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
I can't stay
Yes I know
You know I
Hate to go
But goodbye
Love was sweet
I was kind
Never mean
So I'll cry just a little cause 
I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause 
I have to go
Away...Can't you see
How I feel
When I say
Love's unreal
So goodbye
It's been sweet
Even though
Incomplete
So I'll cry just a little cause 
I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause i have to go
Away...Every night
I still hear
Oh your sigh's
Very nearNow it's gone
Gone awayAs 
I onceHeard you say
Now I'll cry just a little cause 
I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause i have to go
Away...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Richard rodgers / lorenz hart
Once i was young --
Yesterday, perhaps --
Danced with jim and paul
And kissed some other chaps.
Once i was young,
But never was naive.
I thought i had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.
And now i know i was naive.
Refrain
I didn't know what time it was
Then i met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of may it was,
And i'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say i'm all your own.
I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I whanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And i know what time it is now.
Verse 2
Once i was old --
Twenty years or so --
Rather well preserved:
The wrinkles did't show.
Once i was old,
But not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
Up my immaginary gun.
But now i ain for only one!
Refrain
I didn't know what time it was
Then i met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of may it was,
And i'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say i'm all your own.
I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I whanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And i know what time it is now.

,Than take me home

,No se si fue por los vino,
,No se si fue por su boca
,Pero entre tanto tango encontré su ropa,
,junta a mi ropa
,No se si fue por Castillo,
,Pugliese, Troilo o Darienzo
,pero su abrazo en mis manos
,era un pincel y la pista un lienzo.
,Hay los vino, seguro che fueron los vino
,(Yo no fui)
,Seguro che fueron los vino.
,No se si fue por los vino,
,no se si fue por su aliento
,pero entre tanda y tanda encontré
,su ombligo, junto a mi cuerpo.
,Y asi volando en la gloria
,Y aterrizando en la ruina
,Yo fui cayendo y cayendo
,En la red de esas medias asesinas
,Hay los vino, seguro che fueron los vino

,Until there's no one to help and nothing you can do
,And if my dreams would come true
,I'd be there looking at you
,And as you start to undo
,I'll hold a mirror to you
,My only solaces is
,You'll never feel such a kiss
,You'll never know what you missed
,You'll never experience true bliss

,What would I do sweet baby
,Where would I go tell the lady
,If I didn’t have you baby
,Right here standing by my side
,How would I get by, oh baby
,How I would I make it through the night, oh lady
,This old world would conquer
,All of my dreams
,They say dreams don’t always come true
,But I’m here to tell you my dreams came true
,The first day I laid eyes on you
,So how would I get by baby
,How would I make it through the night precious lady
,I could not live without you baby
,Standing right by my side
,Where would I go baby
,Now that the kids are all grown up lady
,It’s just you and me baby
,You mean the world the world to me
,They say dreams don’t always come true
,But my dreams came true the moment the night the day
,That I laid eyes on you
,How would I get by baby
,I’d just lay down without you and die baby
,You are my precious sweet lady
,You mean the world to me
,After all these years, my baby
,All the things we’ve been through
,Just you and I together
,The good times, the bad times, the sad times
,You’re still the dream come true for me
,Don’t make me cry baby
,Who would hold me, kiss me, console me baby
,To me you’re like steak and gravy
,And you’re everything, everything to me
,After all these years
,The joy, the sorrow, the love, the tears
,The children and the precious things and memories
,After all these years

I remember Paris in '49. 

The Champs Elysee, 

Saint Michel and old Beaujolais wine.

And I recall that you were mine 

in those Parisienne days. 

Looking back at the photographs. 

Those summer days spent outside corner cafes. 

Oh, I could write you paragraphs, 

about my old Parisienne days.

,Everybody wants to know
,How i get alone
,In these dark days, since you've been gone
,Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes im dyin
,Standing through once step at a time
,I have good days, bad days...Sunshine and rain
,I have good days and bad days
,But somethings never change
,Somedays i wake up and i make up my mind
,Today is the day, I'll leave the past all behind
,Im alright till some now again
,Then im right back where i've always been
,I have good days, bad days...Sunshine and rain
,I have good days and bad days
,But somethings never change
,Ooh my nights are all the same...
,Tonight i'll go home
,To the same old rutine
,Telephone won't By a phone that dont ring
,Whats the use in going out on the town
,I know i've never wear your memory down
,I have good days, bad days...Sunshine and rain
,I have good days and bad days
,But somethings never change
,Ooh my nights are all the same...
,Keep havings those good days...bad days
,Keep havings those good days...bad days
,
,Had to keep on till a line went empty
,Had to keep on till it came on wide
,Keep on burnin' when the fire was dying
,Till I burn it down...
,I've been lookin' on the dark side
,I don't know what I've thought I could find
,Now there's a stranger in the mirror
,Lookin' back at me, he says it's a payback time
,I could drift away so easy to that old familiar place
,But it's a high price to pay
,I've ran out of excuses and it's hard to face
,But I believe I've lost my way
,I wouldn't cut out to be alone
,But I keep findin' myself alone
,I wear the silence like an overcoat
,And the nightmare lingers on
,I had a dream about a sister who lived alone since gone away
,I reached out and touched her face
,Then she burr to read in silence and she began to pray
,And I knew I'd lost my way
,And I knew I'd lost my way

,
,（S. MacKinnon/M. Johnson）
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love
,
,The sun don't rise the same
,
,When a heart sings,
,
,like a moonbeam
,
,It shines on everything
,
,If I told you,
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,
,I could not lie, if I tried
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love
,
,The birds don't sound the same
,
,With your sweet smile
,
,going on for miles
,
,It warms up everything
,
,If ya told me,
,
,you were so sure
,
,You found out that love
,
,had come to town
,
,you don't second guess it,
,
,if you know love
,
,Cotton candy and summer nights
,
,String of pearls and city lights
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,Lazy river and light
,
,pretty thoubo dark come my eye
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love,
,
,the words won't sound the same
,
,I have stumbled
,
,I have wondered
,
,and found sweet happiness
,
,What if I told you
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,If you know love
,
,well no way yes second guess it
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know like I know love

,
,Why do birds suddenly appear
,Every time you are near?
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,Why do stars fall down from the sky
,Every time you walk by?
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,On the day that you were born the angels got together
,And decided to create a dream come true
,So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
,And starlight in your eyes of blue
,That is why all the boys in town
,Follow you all around
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,Well, on the day that you were born the angels got together
,And decided to create a dream come true
,So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
,And starlight in your eyes of blue
,Yeah, that is why all the boys in town
,Follow you all around
,Well, just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,
,It's late in the evening
,She's wondering what clothes to wear
,She puts on her make-up
,And brushes her long blonde hair
,And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
,And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."
,A noite é de festa
,E ela veste o luar
,Me arrasta me testa
,Se sente uma superstar
,E então pergunta se eu estou em paz
,E eu digo sim
,I feel wonderful tonight
,I feel wonderful because I see
,The love light in your eyes
,And the wonder of it all
,Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
,I feel wonderful because I see
,The love light in your eyes
,And the wonder of it all
,Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
,De volta para casa
,Cansados de festejar
,Me deita me abraça
,Me beija não quer fala
,And then I tell her as I turn off the lights
,Darling, estavas linda até de mais
,I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight
,I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight
,
,I can't believe it's over
,I watched the whole thing fall
,And I never saw the right man was on the wall
,If I'd only knew
,Days were slipping past
,That the good things never last
,That you were crying
,Summer turned to winter
,And the snow it turned to rain
,And the rain turned into tears upon your face
,I hardly recognized the girl you are today
,And god I hope it's not too late
,It's not too late
,'Cause you are not alone
,I'm always there with you
,And we'll get lost together
,Till the light comes pouring through
,'Cause when you feel like you're done
,And the darkness has won
,Babe, you're not lost
,When your worlds crashing down
,And you can't bear the cross
,I said, babe, you're not lost
,Life can show no mercy
,It can tear your soul apart
,It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
,But you're not
,Things have seem to changed
,There's one thing that's still the same
,In my heart you have remained
,And we can fly fly fly away
,'Cause you are not alone
,And I am there with you
,And we'll get lost together
,Till the light comes pouring through
,'Cause when you feel like you're done
,And the darkness has won
,Babe, you're not lost
,When the worlds crashing down
,And you can not bear the cross
,I said, baby, you're not lost
,I said, baby, you're not lost
,you give your hand to me
,and then you say hello
,and i can hardly speak
,my heart is beating so
,and anyone can tell
,you think you know me well
,well you don't know me
,
,no, you don't know the one
,who dreams of you at night
,and longs to kiss your lips
,and longs to hold you tight
,oh i'm just a friend
,that's all i've ever been
,'cause you don't know me
,
,for i never knew
,the art of making love
,though my heart aches
,with love for you
,afraid and shy
,i've let my chance to go by
,a chance that you might
,love me, too
,
,you give your hand to me
,and then you say good-bye
,i watch you walk away
,beside the lucky guy
,you'll never know
,the one who loves you so
,well, you don't know me
,
,for i never knew
,the art of making love
,though my heart aches
,with love for you
,afraid and shy
,i've let my chance go by
,a chance that you might

,
,I see trees of green red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,
,The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,
,I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do
,
,They're really saying I love you
,
,I hear babies cry I watch them grow
,
,They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,Feels like a fire
,That burns in my heart
,Every single moment that we spend apart
,I need you around
,For every day to start
,I haven't left you alone
,Something about you, staring in your eyes
,Everything I looking for I seem to find
,All this time away
,Is killing me inside
,I need your love in my life
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,We fought in a battle, but nobody won
,Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
,You can't turn away,
,The past is said and done
,I need us to carry on
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,You'll try everything
,You never thought of before
,When you live, when you love,
,When you give, when you run
,You can always give up some more
,Baby nothing means anything
,Unless you're here to share with me
,I can breathe, I can live
,I can die,I can sleep
,Cause you are always there in my dreams
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,Birds flying high
,You know how i feel
,Sun in the sky
,You know how i feel
,Reeds driftin' on by
,You know how i feel
,It's a new dawn
,It's a new day
,It's a new life
,For me

,What I got to do to make you love me?
,What I got to do to make you care?
,What do I do when lightning strikes me?
,And I wake to find that you're not there?
,What I got to do to make you want me?
,What I got to do to be heard?
,What do I say when it's all over?
,Sorry seems to be the hardest word.
,It's sad, so sad
,It's a sad, sad situation.
,And it's getting more and more absurd.
,That sorry seems to be the hardest word.
,It's sad, so sad
,Why can't we talk it over?
,Oh it seems to me  sorry seems to be your hardest word
,It's sad, so sad
,It's a sad, sad situation.
,And it's getting more and more absurd.
,It's sad, so sad
,That sorry seems to be the hardest word.
,Why can't we talk it over?
,Oh it seems to me
,What I got to do to make you love me?
,What I got to do to be heard?
,What do I do when lightning strikes me?
,What have I got to do?
,What have I got to do?
,When sorry seems to be the hardest word.
All through the Night
Cyndi Lauper

All through the night
I'll be awake and i'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
~nmusic~
Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
~nmusic~

from Adaptation 
by MYK & Shirosky

,like a lazy afternoon I'm just chilin'
,flat on my back staring up at the ceiling
,feeling the calm and spilling my songs
,I'm here then I'm gone as I'm steadily killin'
,time as the days fly by
,without a particular place to be I'm on that chase for highs
,in space and time, the great divine
,I feel it calling out but can't wake my mind
,this state I find myself in..
,I gotta get away I can't help it
,distractions arise like the blasphemous lies
,the endless in stresses we've dealt with
,for a moment we need to just pause and recollect
,remembering the cause in retrospect
,for a second's breath I said, let's connect

,he sits at his desk with pages and pages 
,of unfinished lines and half written rhymes
*repeat*

,like a lazy afternoon I'm just chillin'
,sun to my back and I'm on my mission
,switch on my headphones listen for fresh tones
,they sound so brilliant
,when your mind is free inside the deep end
,thoughts they flow so sweet it's so complete'n
,I perceive those highs you seek when
,I let go and speak and unfold the beats
,then take it back to the essence of pure
,beautiful scenery's suggesting the cure
,the world's going on outside so get out of your head and head out the door
,for a moment we need to just pause and recollect
,remembering the cause in retrospect
,for a second's breath I said, let's connect

,Yeah yeah, yeah
,Uh, stop rewinding the flow back
,Since the modern days, new wave would throwback

,And if it ain't the same as ours, the we'll wreck your team
,I betcha, we gonna pressure, we twice as strong
,Homie, you ain't winnin' nothin, no, the price is wrong
,Let's say' Brooklyn keep on makin' it, LA keep on takin' it
,Do this for the spray painted??? with the break you kids
,Black tops where we play since '86
,Fake chrome spinners in the place of Mercedes rims
,Busted our Mercedes Benz, blew up on the 405
,No one's never seen it since
,Uh, I don't sweat that though

,Nieve, won't you please playback
,(So I give them something they can playback)
,Another moment, another day in these modern times
,I wanna show them that when I flow on this is more than rhymes
,Is more than anyone expected
,Feel it in my soul, like it's burning in my intestine
,Best in class, now they calling me professor
,Put me on the pedestal and wait for me to mess up
,Little do they know that I'm never gonna crash and burn
,Why the ones who know it all, always last to learn
,They call me Nieve, cause I always had a dream
,That I'll make it to the top from the bottom of the heap
,So no matter what they speak or the words they choose to throw against me
,Don't test me, don't mess my shoes
,They'll play me dirty, I'll never lose sleep or wake up early
,Cause you'll never gonna move me from my slot 11: 30 on the Late Night
,Showing that I'm putting up a great fight
,Go ahead, poke and try to make my, take my

,5 years old, I was turning melodies into gold, yeah, yeah
,Some people said (Some people said)
,Some people said I don't fit the mold (No I don't fit the mold)
,But now my flow is so solid, and it takes away your soul (Yeah, yeah)
,Leaving you astonished and losing all control (Say what, say what)
,Nieve (Yeah Nieve)
,I always had this dream (uh huh), to be the best I can be (Yeah, yeah)
,Soon they're gonna see (Come on, come on)
,Quick, give me the mic and let me spit it
,If I grab it from you swift, don't worry I'll let you finish
,It's been so long, since I heard something that wasn't so raw
,So I tell my stories in my own song
,Trying to get them right from the get go, so they never let go
,Know everybody's got an opinion so it's stressful
,They love the stress yo, I keep it high grade
,That's why I'm keeping it moving while on the highway
,So if you try to pull me over
,I'll have to pull a maneuver before I floor it on my rover
,Here's a move I never showed ya, switch my style
,It's no fair when they're squarer than a kitchen towel
,Step past them, I'm living with a passion
,Written the lyrics on my napkin
,Mixed with the skills that be built from my blood and bones
,You gotta play it back, yo I love this song
,Just step back and relax your mind

,H-E-Art, We be Heart

,The music need a little more heart a little more soul
,Either too hot or a little too cold
,Way too many shallow verses
,Nothing deep rather surface
,Too weak to be defined as timeless
,So we gotta guide these blinded rhymers
,Away from their shiny diamonds and fancy coats
,Show’em what matters most
,Rappers boast, stunt and show off
,Scared to be looked at as something so soft
,Trying to be hard but they’re hardly real
,Making so-called music you hardly feel
,That’s why they leave a lot left to be desired.
,So I try to write to rekindle the fire
,Lifting it higher this simple man with a pen
,Trying to give you something you can feel again
,HE who’s in love with the ART
,Should know its always best to come from the HEART
,When the music don’t feel the same
,Need to let the world feel your pain
,HE who’s in love with the ART
,Should know its always best to come from the HEART
,When the music don’t feel the same
,Need to let the world feel your pain
,And they love to hear it
,Constructing lyrics to touch the spirit
,So fresh it inspire the hopeless
,Better myself and retire the dopest
,Or at least well respected
,I’m free to be me and I sell my message
,But people are rarely rich
,So for little or nothing I share my gift
,While you…vibe to it stare and drift
,In to space take your mind on a daring trip
,To a place music nowadays never ventures
,Embrace the experience let me enter
,The next adventure remains a mystery
,Then I paint a picture to stain your memory
,And secure my place in history
,In your heart I stay, come visit me.
,HE who’s in love with the ART
,Should know its always best to come from the HEART
,When the music don’t feel the same

,I was told not to hold back
,And wrote raps fo’ cats to use for healing
,And say things that you ain’t use to hearing
,Don’t believe everything the news revealing
,So I grab mics and use speakers
,To expose gems for the truth seekers
,Cause they just might be the future leaders
,Erasing all doubt making true believers
,Of you and me (huh) all is possible
,Self pride can make y’all unstoppable
,And help you push through your obstacles
,Peace is a must but war is optional
,HE who’s in love with the ART
,Should know its always best to come from the HEART
,When the music don’t feel the same
,Need to let the world feel your pain

,Consider my love
,The days when we were
,Together so young
,Our love was enough
,Remember?
,1974
,The Lord put me on this planet with a plan to be as hard as granite
,Calm spirit, no panic at the childbirth
,Verse read
,Mother shaped my head with a kiss
,“Damn! he got a strong grip…” as I suckled
,My Father’s knees buckled from the joy
,Luck would have it that this bouncing baby boy would
,Gravitate towards being
,Poetic, Emceein' in the future
,But for now on the nipple like a hookah
,Fast forward, play games and duke a bit
,The years progress
,Messed with cats that dib and dabbled in chess
,Less strategical but meaningful
,Growing was completed so fast
,3rd grader doing 5th grade math
,Knew the library staff and half the books I read shed light
,Damn! Those Arabian Knights
,Was influenced by love that be of my birthright
,Consider my love
,The days when we were
,Together so young
,Our love was enough
,Remember?
,Sundays at church, watching the preacher work the pulpit
,Sit next to Ma
,Pay attention or you’d get pent against the wall
,Times was serious but love conquered
,Above sponsors of hate
,So we had to relate in those days
,Hip Hop was ill
,Conforming to the whack performing was unreal
,And listen that’s real!
,We’d kill for a chance to go dance and wop
,Pop music was hot and new
,Boys would pop and groove with high tops and loose shoes
,To hip hop that incorporated jazz and blues
,In high school, arts were plentiful
,Magnetic programs romance was synthetic
,Dead it in a minute so much love, but love I’m tryin to get it
,Through roads and streets
,Avenues and creeks
,Seek what my heart desires buying tracks that meet
,Complete now so…
,Consider My Love
,The days when we were
,Together so young
,Our love was enough
,Remember?
,Those family functions
,No interruptions
,Bustin “The Dozens” on kin folk
,Mainly your cousins
,It’s all love
,In good spirit
,Used to hear it from the older generation
,Chasin' them dreams and stacking cream for all of us
,We used to boost a bit
,Young kids with the itch to have them cool fits and fly kicks, Nike Dunks
,California raised, so the hustle was engrained from day one
,Fake one’s that front
,Give it up
,Childhood was good
,From Stockton to Inglewood
,Boggs Tract in fact is where the foundation lies at
,Now Mac trucks back up to speed the track up
,I plead, don’t crack up the dirt before we act up
,From the foot to the brain impact cuts the soul deep
,A whole heap but peep we still gain
,Things have changed but memories stay the same
,This brave heart parts with…
,Consider My Love

,Chorus by Chan Kwong Wing
,who love my downfall
,and it's just too cold
,you show me true friend
,baby i was so so
,you might as well call me up physically
,you know, you got me only into extremes
,and i can't believe it
,and don't know what to think
,sometime around it was so love-sick
,now it's so sick
,cause they ain't doubt love
,your hint is apart
,and the day between us wasn't enough
,and i know
,i feel good time's come
,i thought they stay, things are done and become word-made
,
,angels came but they left you day
,had you slip away
,listen now
, burning empty
,still this can't be
,but even now we're not that happy
,hotel motel it's hot in hell free from myself
,but now left with no home
,i want you to know
,i never would have all
,figure out that when you came now
,it could have been forever
,now it does bring me down
, the high now the low up and down we go
,put myself too close got burnt night tones
,it feels like i'm sinking in the dead sea
,don't we care the space inside us so empty
,it's like it's over before be gone
,this song is over now so was i want

,陰と陽 寒と暑 燥と湿 四季の移ろい
,万物のかわりは 初から始
,春を告げる
,もうしゅんき
,ちゅうしゅんき
,きしゅんき
,今天我刚好春意盎然
,迎孟宇的雨露 浸润着新的循环
,我试着把那冷的少年轻轻召唤
,把你昨日带来的冷在心头吹散
,你可以找我聊聊天又或是下盘棋
,我给你泡壶茶再告诉你点小秘密
,夹杂点小诗意 慢慢解读小事情
,微观现小世纪 谈谈自然小秩序
,朦胧烟月下 一醉对花眠
,风冷梦惊觉 飞红埋枕边
,有时候期待一首诗春夜偶成
,有时候推开一扇门恰似你们
,形影问答前我看还是给你撑把伞
,孤独的人若是病了恐怕会没人管
,你说你爱着未知数
,渴望着爱之助
,重复着爱的路
,终于爱变成未知数
,所以 你需要一场春的雨
,所以 你需要搭配吹奏一首春的曲
,所以 你需要失去重力的像春的绿
,失去重力之前标题先打上春的序
,你看那云层上的阳光
,会让你安静只想仰望
,她教你万物中的想象
,既清冷又温暖的春阳
,晒掉身上的霉味
,丢掉虚伪的玫瑰
,无聊的人在讨论这段感情对不对
,寂寞的人在讨论今晚我们睡不睡
,孤独的人在看着他们到底累不累
,你问我春天是什么
,我说答案在太阳里面
,你问我春天是什么
,我说答案在月球背面
,你问我春天是什么
,我说答案在太阳里面
,你问我春天是什么
,我说答案在月球背面
,你问我春天是什么

,Where the stars come and go

,Not as distant as it seemed
,Dreams are moments night is long
,Yet we linger in the past
,Tell me do you feel the same
,I can take you far far away
,Far enough for us to disappear
,Should you feel a little scared
,Know that I'm still right here
,It will be a little bittersweet
,It might even feel a bit surreal
,Just see the stars run past you as you
,Drift apart in air
,Like the leaves riding on the autumn breeze
,Like the days gone too far for us to seize
,We move on and leave it as it is
,But once in a while let the reminiscence brighten this melody

,你说你喜欢粉色香槟的粉
,我问你是否爱过一个不该爱过的人
,你说是否过于浪漫一切会失真
,我说我感觉自己现在好像拿破仑
,你突然笑笑 这画面感觉惟妙惟肖
,这氛围缠绕 有时候 浪漫多妖娆
,慢慢变熟悉 动作也渐渐随意
,我事先声明 今天我可没**
,你问我口感怎样 我如实回答
,我说你长的漂亮 你说谢谢夸奖
,进入正题 我话题随机 文字的功底
,你闭上眼睛 我把画面传给你
,这回忆一样的初夏之风叫千羽
,多年以后会温暖的把你回忆起
,你说再浪漫的语言都不及我爱你
,我说这么直接 会吓到我自己
,
,（你温柔的拂面）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,（三月的春艳）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,我向你描绘着书籍里的点点红尘
,你说你不知何时才能遇见想遇见的人
,轻描淡写的口吻 一切随缘 会等
,一人好过 敌不过 两人的体温
,我还是烟雾环绕
,把话题打住
,免得你思绪焦躁
,浪漫的夜晚还是用浪漫去探讨
,手里的北极光 燃烧并发出讯号
,我让你重温时间 那些曾发过的誓言
,恰好的晕眩 慢慢回忆两人画面
,恰巧的浮现 恰当的描绘他的脸
,恰到你最爱的季节 他却向你告别
,分开的时候总带有太多抱歉
,伤感的季节又积累太多抱怨
,热恋的触觉 败给了时间
,我们总是伤害着又爱着像是做实验
,只为了你出现
,我也在做实验
,你也在做实验

,But you're never here to see me right
,And I never seem to lose a run
,When we're following your stars at night
,See your lungs are never breathing right
,Your mother's never eaten right
,You see she never really won her fight
,She's handing me her torch to light
,Your fears and tribulations they are formed into a painting
,They are formed into a painting of us
,As I peer across the nation all your stars get to formation
,They are more than your creation of love
,And the rhythm of our are hearts are syncopated vindicated
,Leave our doubts to sleep right here
,Feel I wish that I could speak your perfect language
,I wish that we could travel to those places
,Where we're faceless and we're nameless

,You're only searching for that buried treasure

,Could ever bring you any sort of pleasure

,For every stain neither of us feeling better

,Too unaware to see the truth
,The loss of a girls wasted youth
,And you can't save her no more
,Uhh uhh
,And you can't save her no more
,Tough as diamonds
,Soft as silk
,She's as pure as devils milk
,She's a product
,Of the party
,That is done
,Another notch
,On her bed
,She forgets the times she said
,That when sex becomes a habit
,It's no fun
,Crossing the line between love and lust
,The only difference here is the heartache
,And the utter lack of trust
,And you can't save her no more

Like Cleopatra got the masses at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze
And if you stay a while
Inevitably, you gone be biting my style
In your later days (well, well, well)
Let me tell you what is fact and what is true
I get high and that ain’t that much to do
I'm always in a daze (uh huh)
That was just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well

Don't let the days of your life pass you by

Can't spend your whole life trying to get high

What's been happening? How you doing? Where you been
I'm further behind now than I was back then
Lost in some old maze (uh huh)
Some years have passed me by
All I want is to go get high
I'll get it together some other day

,
In my dreams I dwell
Cause all my dreams are swell
You would too
If you could see them
That's what I know
I gotta go
Get up
Get out and (yeah)

Bernadette people are searchin' for
the kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
and never find the love I've found in you.
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
and I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend when all the time
they long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own
for just one moment we have known.
Bernadette they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette
when they can not control themselves Bernadette
from needing you wanting you
But darling you belong to me.
I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world you're the soul of me
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
the world is searching for
But you you give me the joy this heart of mine
has always been longing for.
In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore
that's why I treasure you and place you high above
for the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do Bernadette keep on loving me
Bernadette keep on needing me
Bernadette.
Bernadette.
Your the soul of me
more than a dream your a plan to me.
you mean more to me
than a woman was ever meant to be.

,And feather canyons everywhere

,But now they only block the sun
,They rain and snow on everyone
,So many things I would have done
,But clouds got in my way

,From up and down, and still somehow
,It`s cloud illusions I recall
,I really don`t know clouds at all
,(-------- Misic --------)
,Moons and junes and ferris wheels
,The dizzy dancing way you feel
,As every fairy tale comes real
,I`ve looked at love that way

,But now it`s just another show
,You leave them laughing when you go
,And if you care, don`t let them know
,Don`t give yourself away

,From give and take, and still somehow
,It`s loves illusions I recall

,To say I love you right out loud
,Dreams and schemes and circus crowds

Love the one that's right
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your eyes
Take a look, let him in
Don't let your life go by dreamin'
'Bout some other guy when you are dancin'
With him cheek to cheek
Flying around in a jet
Champagne and limos you bet!
Laughing and having some fun
Though he's not even the one
Love the one that's right for love
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your heart
Take a chance, let him in
Don't try to say that he's not
'Cause of all the things that he's got
For he's just a guy that wants you and he'll be true
And although he just tries to explain
That all of this fun's not a game
He'll turn around and walk out that door
Just tell him he's yours!

I'm looking for something
And that something is you
You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold
But all that really matters
Are the things that we do
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
But I can't stand still
I'm so excited, I just wanna scream
I see you right before me
And it's like a real good dream
But I want you to know something, Baby
Yes, it's really true
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
I can't stand still
I'm looking for something
And that something is you
You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold

Written：Harold Arlen/Ted Koehler Arranger：Nelson Riddle
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world, what a life - I'm in love.
I got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger.
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love.
Life is a beautiful thing as long as I hold the string.
I'd be a silly so-and-so if I should ever let it go.
I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger.
What a world, what a life - I'm in love.
Life is a beautiful thing as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so if I should ever let it go.
I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world!　Man, this is the life.
Hey, now! I'm so in love.
That's how it goes
When you feel so sad you feel so low
Life seems so bad I know, I know
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
You may think it's funny
but it always shows,
Try to hide it honey, oh no, it shows.
That's how it goes
Some people say,
Everything's gonna be okay,
Just give it a while,
You'll find you're back
Back in style
But I don't know life will get better
I am sure they know,
Sooner or later it shows, I know
That's how it goes
It's funny to see how easy life can be
Just sit back and smile
You'll find that life is worthwhile
That's how it goes
When you're on top the whole world knows
Wouldn't want to stop it, oh no, it shows
That's how it goes

,Songs Title：i get a kick out of you
,My story is much to sad to be told
,But practically everything leaves me totally cold
,The only exception I know is the case
,When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
,Then I suddenly turn and see
,Your fabulous face
,I get no kick from champagne
,Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
,So tell me why should it be true
,That I get a kick out of you
,Some like the perfume from spain
,Im sure that if I took even one sniff
,It would bore me terrifically too
,But I get a kick out of you
,I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
,I get a kick though its clear to see, you obviously do not adore me
,
,I get no kick in a plane
,Flying too high with some gal in the sky
,Is my idea of nothing to do
,But I get a kick out of you
,
,
When I look into your eyes
I see sunshine
The coulds are blown away
I hope you're here to stay'
Cause I've got me needing more of you
Guess I'm falling for you
You walk away
My eyes caress you
Then you turn and smile
You've caught me thinkin' of love with you
Guess I'm falling, 
I may be falling for you
Since I met you days are brighter
Life's uneven loads are lighter
When I hear you whisper the words 
I long to hear dear
Now I look into your eyes
I'm lost in knowing that you are all 
I wantMy need for you is growing
Guess I'm falling, 
I think I'm falling for you
Think about falling for me too
,A foggy day in London Town
,I had me low and had me down
,
,I viewed the morning with such alarm
,
,The British Museum had lost its charm
,
,How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
,But the age of miracles hadn't passed,
,
,For, suddenly, I saw you there
,
,And through foggy London Town
,
,The sun was shining everywhere.

,You're dancin', dancin', dancin' throught the night
,You're swingin' now
,Make your move, take a chance
,Just get on that floor and dance
,Don't be cool, don't be slick
,You just keep on swingin', keep on swingin'

,Grab a guy
,You tell him, tell him, tell him don't ask why

,
,
,
,Lover, when Im near you, and I hear you - speak my name
,
,Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame
,
,Lover, please be tender, when youre tender - fears depart
,
,Lover, I surrender - to my heart
I'm making this one special evening
Taking a chance in my life
Hoping you feel the same way as I do tonight
Just try and look into my eyes
Don't be scared of what you might see there
The first time I saw you
I knew love at first sight must be true, so true, oh so true
And now I just have to explain why I feel this way
I feel joy, I feel pain
You're in my heart and it's tearing me apart
'Cause I love you, I love you, I love you!
,
,
,
,
,Another night, another drink
,Another time to contemplate and think
,Will I ever, ever have anyone to love
,
,It's not that I don't try
,Maybe I try too hard
,Seems like I'm living a lie
,So there's a game I just won't learn
,And I wonder will I always be alone
,I take a sip and wonder
,Why I haven't anyone to love
,
,I guess I'll say goodnight
,My drink's done and it's morning light
,Sorry my friend but you see
,What other ending could there be
,And I wonder will I always be alone?
,I take a drink and wonder
,Will I ever have anyone to love?
,My Funny Valentines - Frank Sinatra
,My funny valentine
,sweet comic valentine
,You make me smile with my heart
,Your lips are laughable
,Unphotographable
,Yet you're my favoring work of art
,Is your figure less than Greek
,Is your mouth a little weak
,When you open it to speak
,are you smart
,But don't change a hair for me
,Not if you care for me
,stay little valentine stay
,Each day is valentine's day
,Is your mouth a little weak
,When you open it to speak
,are you smart
,But don't change a hair for me
,Not if you care for me
,stay little valentine stay
,Each day is valentine's day
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day, day and night
Why is it so that this longing for you
Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

,一路披荆斩棘 对明天 极度憧憬
,这生活像是演习 忘了那 一路风景
,天生注定殊途 就不要妄想舒服
,如果人与人能了解谁又会染上孤独 病
,卑鄙还是伟大
,恶毒或者天生善良
,有些人为了清清静静
,有些人为了得到赞扬
,这辈子也确实比较漫长
,让人不懂如何磨合
,混凝土不过也是烂墙
,而我从小就野心勃勃
,不甘一生平庸
,成功 绝对不是凭空
,空想结果只有 腾空
,努力才能逢凶 化吉
,眼里要有通天路
,不然被自己锁在门中
,如果 循环有序
,朝 人前走去
,这条路绝不能崩
,跌倒怎么会算失败
,在于你是否爬的起来
,怪父母没给好的姿态
,变成了手里杂的底牌
,不努力不自取还怪人无视你
,喝着那涣散的药
,不敢衣锦还乡
,你不敢面对你爸妈那灿烂的笑
,这不是二次元的世界 这生活里面哪有雏田
,在外奔波多少日夜 回到家照样哑口无言
,笔墨纸砚满肚城府 现状却活的惨不忍睹
,自己还在告诫自己 武松 岂能胆怵猛虎
,别埋怨社会变了 厌了 倦了 你见的都太片刻
,其实事与物从未变过 是你一直被自己骗着
,活在黑暗中嘲讽光亮惨 对比着赢家去当样板
,在他们冷眼中变的也很想疯把握不住方向感
,捧哏怎么就没逗哏棒 当不上主角就滚蛋
,生活总是起伏跌荡那么满腹经纶又怎样
,咸鱼翻身才超棒的
,跃了龙门难道不高尚吗
,至少不会再原地招望着
,那就在漫长黑夜去飘荡吧
,捧哏怎么就没逗哏棒 当不上主角就滚蛋

,那就在漫长黑夜去飘荡吧
,有些人来自乡下
,而我也来自乡下
,要做被敬仰的艺术家
,也想要后人都记住他
,从此背负多少脏骂
,和母亲对我的牵挂
,自古以来都是 得民心者 才能得到天下
,看不惯坏人的冷嘲热讽 他的假话像刺骨的风
,打不倒爷的铁骨铮铮 少势兄弟的第一盏灯
,进入你世界 来到你世界 才明白 都是你埋好的根
,你眼中的罪人比谁都真
,你选中的罪人没有在恨
,要像个孩子般天真的笑 哎
,拜把子喝过的尿 哎

,凡事贯彻互惠互利双赢，说话直白开门见山我就是这种人
,你的眼神里面没得诚意
,我看到的只有索取
,开你妈个跛儿皮喝酒钱都给不起
,唯一能做的只有称兄道弟

,PO8 on the track
,在凌晨 三点钟 克利夫兰机场在安检中
,手机上的邮件都没有任何留恋的全部被删减空
,时不时地看向那机舱外
,速度放得低 碾碎跑道上的冰雪
,Billionaire Swag一身装扮
,头上戴耳机 听的beat都是经典
,我在这城市里留下过太多的记忆
,和离开后就不能再说的秘密
,为爱风干禁忌 会载歌般庆幸
,会盖过这年纪不该有的细腻
,情绪会突然的崩坏在某一个平静又下雨的晴天
,关于离去 或关于某一位曾被我占有的裙边
,凌晨五点航班带上一切然后慢慢升空
,也把那些经历过的患难挣脱
,空荡的街区像乌云般叠起
,下一场阔别冬雨 打在了沥青上沾湿我鞋底 也许
,会让我泪目 让我去遗忘或让我去对付尴尬的岁数
,常常会坠入 时间的陷阱它刺痛我肋部
,像一个城市里迷失的背包客
,用纸笔抒写段过往的云烟
,从快贷球场的中心飞过 那来往的车辆依旧没有停歇
,chorus
,像一幅画卷的城市 慢慢升空也许我从没来过
,让灵感乍现的文字 慢慢升空带走了挫败的我
,熟悉的味道在新的风景里围绕
,最后的冬天就让我一个人睡着
,都抓不住的时间 像沙一样流走的瞬间 hold on
,还想要说些什么 但只能沉默
,告别那过去的生活 太多的矛与盾相对的争夺
,让我去斟酌 习惯了分合 眼泪到离开后才会动真格
,但是我从来没想要跟谁比 我在站在这时间的分水岭
,为我的音乐 注满了心血 就一头扎进了深水里
,在那没有光的房间一个人的夜里
,脑袋里面重复放着一座城的电影
,就压着那无关痛痒的韵 那是封关于我过往的信
,渐渐 习惯 睡梦的辗转反侧
,在下雨之后不远处的云端都被燃烧过的日落给完全染色
,当阳光进入会偶尔想窗边看 映入我眼里的光圈散
,静默在在房间看又一根夹她手指的香烟断了
,可能我只是个闯大江南北的过客
,和这里的人和物完美的错过
,为大麻而堕落的朋友变落破
,也目击过黑人受白人的唾沫
,在每一条大道或每一个街角
,萧条或恬淡被拿捏的刚好
,破旧的城市都被人遗弃
,但诗人总诞生在无名的荒岛
,chorus

Des yeux qui font baiser les miens 
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche 
Voila le portrait sans retouche 
De l’homme auquel j’appartiens 

Quand il me prend dans ses bras 
Je vois la vie en rose 
ll me dit des mots d’amour 
Des mots de tous les jours 
Et ca me fait quelque chose  
ll est entre dans mon coeur 
Une part de bonheur 
Dont je connais la cause 

C’est lui pour moi  
Moi pour lui 
Dans la vie 
ll me l’a dit,l’a jure 
Pour la vie 
Des que je l’apercois 
Alors je me sens en moi 
Mon coeur qui bat 

Des nuits d’amour plus finir 
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place 
Les ennuis,les chagrins trepassent 
Heureux,heureux a en mourir 

Quand il me prend dans ses bras 
Je vois la vie en rose 
ll me dit des mots d’amour 
Des mots de tous les jours 
Et ca me fait quelque chose 
ll est entre dans mon coeur 
Une part de bonheur 
Dont je connais la cause

,I couldn't wait to see you - waiting by the door
,There's no one there to meet me - and your clothes are on the floor
,Sorry if I hurt you - and I made you cry
,Couldn't stand to see you - with another guy
,It's the bluest blues - and it cuts me like a knife
,It's the bluest blues - since you walked out of my life
,Couldn't really tell you - how you hurt my pride
,Something broke within me - down inside
,I never knew I loved you - till you went away
,Now the loneliness surrounds me - everyday
,It's the bluest blues - since you walked out of the door
,It's the bluest blues - cause I won't see you no more
,I'm sorry if I failed you - if somehow I'm to blame
,It's the bluest blues I'm feeling - it's a crying shame
,I just can't live without you - face another day
,It's the bluest blues I'm feeling, and it's here to stay
,It's the bluest blues, and it cuts me to the bone
,It's the bluest blues, when you can't find your way home

,凯斯・厄本――为你牺牲/付出
,Well, all I saw was smoke and fire...
,I didn't feel a thing.
,But suddenly I was rising higher...
,And I felt like I just made...the biggest mistake.
,When I thought about my unborn child...
,When I thought about my wife...
,And the answer rang out CLEAR from somewhere up above
,No greater gift has man, then to lay down his life for Love.
,And I wondered, would I give my life?
,Could I make that sacrifice?
,If it came down to it, could I take the bullet...I would
,Yes I would, For You
,Baby, you don't understand...I don't understand it all myself.
,But there's a Brother on my left and another on my right
,And in his pocket just like mine...he's got a photograph.
,And they're waitin' for him back home.
,And it's weighing on my mind...
,I'm not trying to be the hero...I don't want to die...
,But right now, in this moment, you don't think twice.
,I wondered, would I give my life?
,Could I make that sacrifice?
,If it came down to it, could I take the bullet...I would
,Yes I would
,You don't think about right.
,You don't think about wrong.
,You just do what you gotta do...to defend your own.
,And I do this thi
,For You
,Yes i would
,I would give my life
,I would make that sacrifice
,If it came down to it,could I take bullet...I would
,Yse,I would,I do For You
,I do For You
,Yes I would
,Yes I would

,I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
,You are my shinin' star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
,There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
,You're at the top of my list ‘cause I'm always thinkin' of you
,
,I still remember in the days when I scared to touch you
,How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say I love you
,You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
,That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
,Oh, my love
,A thousand kisses from you is never too much
,I just don't wanna stop
,A million days in your arms is never too much
,Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
,Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
,I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
,Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
,Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'
,Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
,I'd rather be with you ‘cause you make my heart scream and holler
,Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'

It’s time to get back on the road
Saddle up saddle up get ready to go
I’ve got a silly idea, I wanna do something weird
I’ve got a donkey we can ride
I’ve got a suitcase full of sparkling wine
I wanna have some fun before we go over the hill

I know there is a big scary
World out there just waiting for me
And it’s time for us to saddle up

All I wanna do is
settle down settle down and find my tune
Somewhere nice and quiet where I could show vegetables
I might not be a success
But if I make you happy I guess
That’s more than I ever could have hoped for

I know there is a big scary
World out there just waiting for me
And it’s time for us to saddle up

I know there is a big scary
World out there just waiting for me
And I didn’t want to grow up
But I was just so afraid of
Being left behind by everyone

,
,I wanna know
,Is it real what's the deal this time?
,Let's take it slow
,Never be afraid to show
,What we feel
,Let's take a chance
,It's too late I can't wait no more
,Your super magics
,Don't ever wanna let it go
,Tonight is the night
,Love is a kiss away
,So let's make it right
,Tell me you're going to stay
,One minute from love
,Everything can be what flows so still
,One minute from love
,Baby let me hear you say you will
,One minute from love
,Let me hold you in my arms tonight
,One minute from love
,Everything is gonna be alright

(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland)
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts
Of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand
To a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says
"Baby, uh uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers, though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt
(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland)
Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
(I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland)
(All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland, wonderland)
(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)
(I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland)
(Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah
Dance, boogie wonderland, ah, ah)

Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, wonderland
Hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm, hm-hm-hm-hm)
(All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying

,30 days 'til Christmas and all I know
,Is I'm not quite ready to let go of this past year
,I have so much to show
,One more month
,And all I need is a sign from you that you think of me
,If you don't
,Then please just say so
,Cause all I do
,Is think of you
,And it's wearing me out
,It's wearing me down
,This holiday is nothing but frowns for me
,But I've got a gift
,You see
,I'm making a list
,Hell I'll check it twice
,Of all the things you've done in my life
,Then I'll send it your way
,So you see why I love you
,Who would have thought that someone like me
,Could of fall in love so easily.
,I know that you know that I know what I want
,I know I cant have it but give it a thought.
,I know that it sounds crazy baby
,But all I do is think of you.
,And it's wearing me out
,It's wearing me down
,This holiday is nothing but frowns for me
,But I've got a gift
,You see
,I'm making a list
,Hell I'll check it twice
,Of all the things you've done in my life
,Then I'll send it your way
,So you see why I love everything you throw my way
,I know it's hard to say
,But it's a crying shame that I came all this way
,With so much to say
,But all that came out was "Happy Holiday"
,A home cooked meal and a nice warm bed
,Somebody to love
,A place to lay my head
,But I got 30 days and I'm gonna make 'em count
,Cause I cant call it Christmas without someone to smile about
  A kiss, a kiss
 I'm wishing for a Christmas kiss
 You know, I'm standing by the mistletoe
 And if you shimmy to the left,
 My dear, we couldn't miss
 
 I've got a lot of gadgets
 Like my new iPod, cellphone
 Ringtones and mp3's are great, I know
 But high-tech just isn't what I'm wishing for
 
 Well, if you're wondering what to get me
 I've got almost everything on my list
 But, baby, I'm still wishing
 I'm wishing for a Christmas kiss
 
 I would not say no to dinner and a show in Rome
 And, oh, the sun in Mexico
 And the snow in the Alps
 I couldn't help myself
 As if you didn't know
 
 A Les Paul guitar will get you pretty far
 And I'd be over the moon for a Paris rendezvous
 Well, speaking of the moon,
 How 'bout a round trip
 On a rocketship for two?
 
 'Cause if you're wondering what to get me
 I've got almost everything on my list
 But, baby, I'm still wishing
 I'm wishing for a Christmas kiss
 
 A snowy midnight candy cane kiss
 Is even sweeter than summer's bliss
 It may seem small when expectations are high
 But, baby, it's my one heart's desire
 
 A kiss, a kiss
 I'm wishing for a Christmas kiss
 A kiss, a kiss
 I'm wishing for a Christmas kiss
 My dear, you couldn't miss
 Give me just a Christmas kiss

,Winter days, turn to grey, put the headlights on
,Snow and rain, wiped away, I can't keep my eyes on the road
,When I'm driving home, I got tears, running down
,Burning in my eyes and you and I
,Heated by the flicker of a lighter
,Oh, and I let it go
,But I just got here
,I know it's been a while darling, dear
,There's been a change in the time of year
,When the frost bites the snow
,And Christmas comes around
,For the down and outs
,And broken lay-abouts
,What will they do now?
,When Christmas comes around
,We were so in love
,Till I messed it up
,But who will love me now
,When Christmas comes around
,Family asking me, why I let you go
,Telling me, it’s a mistake
,I'm telling them that I know
,But I can't call you
,Your inner space, better place
,Loving on a new man
,I don't blame you at all

,The Christmas sing-alongs
,The merry and the cheer
,Cuz I don't feel like that this year
,All the bells are all in sync
,And my soul is on the brink
,So I'll have myself a drink, and sing
,Christmas comes around
,For the down and outs
,And broken lay-abouts

,So nice and warm
,Look out the window at the snow
,My sister will be suspicious
,
,My brother will be there at the door
,
,My maiden aunts mind is vicious
,
,Well maybe just a cigarette more
,
,I've got to get home
,
,Say lend me a coat
,
,You've really been grand

Lyrics：Brian Wilson Music：Brian Wilson
My baby she told me
She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)
And kiss my lips anymore (unh-unh!)
She's gonna leave me
And she don't believe me
That I'll be true now
Well maybe she don't love me
And is not thinkin' of me
But why'd she do it this time of year?
She knows that I'll miss her
And I'll want to kiss her
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Tell me, what did I do
To really convince you
That I'm not the guy anymore?
Take back my ring now
I'll do anything now
But please forgive me
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby
Merry Christmas, baby

,That this is gonna be
,The brightest holiday
,'Cause here you are with me
,Baby, baby, I can't wait
,To spend this special time of year with someone who
,Makes me feel the special way that you do
,Walkin' with you in a winter's snow

,People smiling everywhere we go
,It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love
,Ooh, you make the season bright
,With the lights reflecting in your eyes
,All my dreams are comin' true tonight
,It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love
,We'll stay up late tonight
,Decorate the tree
,Just look into my eyes
,And I will tell you truthfully
,That I don't need no Santa Claus
,To hear my Christmas wish
,I got you in my arms
,And what could be a better gift
,Than to spend my very favorite time of year
,With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeeeaahhh

Lyrics：Brian Wilson/Mike Love Music：Brian Wilson/Mike Love
He's the man with all the toys
Someone found a lighted house late one night
And he saw through the window a sight
A big man in a chair
And little tiny men everywhere
He's the man with all the toys
Well how thrilled that someone must have been
And he must have been tempted to go in
He stayed out in the cold
And when he left them he told
About the man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
The man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
,
,There is something stirring
,Something crackling like the firewood
,A certain spirit that has lightened up the neighborhood
,I think it's time for the timeless
,Time of the year
,Time of the year
,You're bundled up, got a blizzard coming on the way
,The family fighting like they do
,'Cause it's the holidays
,And every memory you're holding in your heart is alive once more, right here
,Feels like you're a kid again
,Remember you remember when life was good
,Just watching the snow fall down
,Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
,Just remember in December what is coming 'round
,And you'll find the feeling that you always found
,You can count on Christmas
,Count on Christmas
,Coming back home to the home address
,Something burning in the kitchen with the house a mess
,And this year is promising nothing less
,You can count on Christmas
,Count on Christmas
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
,Count on Christmas
,Count on Christmas
,We got a Christmas song, sing-a-long around the tree
,Hit the eggnog flow until we all tipsy
,There's another movie marathon on TV
,Which one could it be?
,But with all of the presents
,All of the gifts
,It's really about who you're sharing them with
,And just for Christmas Eve, the world's the way it used to be
,Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down
,Just remember in December what is coming 'round
,And you'll find the feeling that you always found
,You can count on Christmas
,Count on Christmas
,We're not too late to hear jingle bells ring
,Santa Claus' coming
,What's he gonna bring
,He's little bit man get you everything
,You can count on Christmas, count on Christmas
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
,Count on Christmas, count on Christmas
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
,Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah

,Count on Christmas, count on Christmas
,Doesn't matter if the year's got you feeling down

She's shackled to the night
Bonded to a darker place
Searching for the lover's face
That haunts her
Listening to the sounds
Of a city as it moves around
Hoping that on sacred ground
She'll find him
And the lover who lurks in the shadows
Cut this hole through her soul
So the children she's leaving tomorrow
Can never be told
Yes, this lover who lurks in the shadows
Cut this hole through her soul
And the children she's leaving tomorrow
Can never be told
She's shackled to the night
Bonded to a darker place
Searching for the lover's face
That haunts her
Searching for the lover's face
That haunts her

I'll tell you something that you wanna know
I'll show you the way that it's gonna go
Here's the story, it's a natural fact
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
It don't matter everywhere you been
It doesn't even matter the shape you're in
If you do the substance just jump back, Jack
'Cause once you get a tasted there's no turning back
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
There's no turning back
People gonna give you all that free advice
They'll tell you once, they'll tell you twice
They'll give you no peace, they'll cut you no slack
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
It always will be and it always was
People always tryin' to cop a buzz
To the center of the earth in three seconds flat
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
Oh, there's no turning back
When you caught that plane, you missed the boat
End of story, that's all she wrote
You can get on the train but be off the track
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
'Cause once you get a taste there's no turning back
Ooh, there's no turning back, hey
Once you get a taste
You need to know there's no turning back
Once you get a taste, once you get a taste
There's no turning back
Once you get a taste, once you get a taste
Don't you try it

,Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
,The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
,Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
,Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
,The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
,Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
,But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
,Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
,Oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
,Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
,See she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
,Lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
,Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
,For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
,Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
,Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
,Standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
,Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
,And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
,Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
,Oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
,Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
,Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
,Lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alone

,You may talk about your clementine and sing of rosalee
,But the yellow rose of texas beats the belles of tennessee

,We walks along the river in the quiet summer night
,She said if you remembers when we parted long ago

,Well, I’ve never been a man of many words,
,and there’s nothing I could say that you haven’t heard.
,But I‘ll sing you love songs till the day I die.
,The way I’m feeling,
,I can’t keep it inside.
,I’ll sing a sweet serenade whenever you’re feeling sad,
,and a lullaby each night before you go to bed.
,I’ll sing to you for the rest of your life.
,The way I’m feeling,  I can’t keep it inside.
,No, I can't keep it inside.

,In a sea...of deep confusion
,Somebody told me - I don't know who
,Whenever you are sad and blue
,And you're feejin' all alone and left behind
,Just take a look inside and you will find
,You gotta hold on, hold on through the night
,Hang on, things will be all right
,Even when it's dark
,And not a bit of sparkling
,Sing-song sunshine from above
,Spreading rays of sunny love - just
,Hang on, hang on to the vine
,Stay on, soon you'll be divine
,If you start to cry, look up to the sky
,Something's coming up ahead
,To turn your tears to dew instead
,And so I hold on to this advice
,When change is hard and not so nice
,If you listen to your heart the whole night through
,Your sunny somedav will come one dav soon to you

 Here you gone today, but I wanted to love you, darling,
 Oh, till the end of time,

 Love's got a hold on me baby
 Feels like a ball and chain.
 Oh, love just draggin' me down, yeah yeah yeah,

 Wonder why when I did the very best I could to love you
 You wanted to leave me here, honey in so much pain
 Come on, honey, I want you to tell me, please, yeah.
 Say oh, oh, oh, oh,
 Honey this can't be
 No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa
 Honey, this can't be just because I want to want you
 Does this mean I have to hide to cry, cry all the time ?

 Seems like anything, it could be the telephone company man,

 Over on the other side, say, not quite got it right this very minute.
 I'm so sorry babe, I said I'm so very sorry babe,
 But I never did promise you nothing, right ? I see what you mean.
 Come on, man, now come on, that ain't the name of it,
 And that ain't the end of it, you know what I mean.
 Sometimes, it feels just about breaking things, you know what I mean.
 Just like, just like a grave, just like a grave to call
 Just like a cry to call.
 Honey I never understood and I said please
 Lord, I swear I never understood and I say please
 I want you to help me, fill it up baby,
 I want you to help me, I said allow me to hear
 Please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
 Honey make me understand why love just feels so heavy on me, darling,
 Feels so bad on my back, babe,
 Feels just like a ball,
 Feels like a ball, ball, oh daddy feels like a ball,
 And a chain.

一样的憔悴

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new - yeah yeah

I loved you with the fire red-
Now it's turning blue, and you say...
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid...

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late whoa.....

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-

,I might've had a couple women
,at the same time
,But you handle the pressure,
,Jack Daniels for breakfast
,A cap of valium mixed
,with antidepressants, precious
,My momma said that we need love
,Till I found out life's a bitch
,with no prenup, you're on your own
,Divorces or court splits,
,decisions and choices
,The Porsche or the fortress?
,Ignore it or forefeit
,You say I'm crazy
,Cause you don't think
,I know what you've done
,But when you call me baby
,I know I'm not the only one
,I know I'm not the only one
,I know I'm not the only one
,I know
,I'm not the only one

,"Welcome To Forever" (feat. Jon Bellion)
,This is real life, the only one we get to live
,I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
,This is real life, everything we do is legendary
,And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
,Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
,Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
,Said this is real life, God damn this is real life
,Yeah, I've been fiending for this moment
,I've been dreaming 'bout this moment
,I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted
,Writing these records like a dissertation
,While the fans go crazy from anticipation
,Damn, nine years that's a lot of patiences
,And now I'm looking at my idols and feeling adjacent
,It's hell of a long way from back in the basement
,Looking at hip-hop tryna find my placement
,I bought my first pair of Jordans at 22
,Same year I bought a crib too
,Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
,And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
,Remember meeting Nas for the first time
,Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines
,Said he a fan, God damn this is my time
,I'm a get it, I'm a do it till we prime time
,I told him every single day that I be at it
,In the studio recording like an addict
,He said that real hip-hop shit I had it
,Thinking to myself damn man you made Illmatic
,This is real life, the only one we get to live
,I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
,This is real life, everything we do is legendary
,And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
,Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
,Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
,Said this is real life, God damn this is real life
,I used wonder what it feel like
,Aight, I guess we back again
,With another verse of about how much I'm black again
,You don't like to blame God for my packaging
,Bringing up my race, don't call me a white rapper then
,Damn, they judging me by my skin tone
,Instead of my talent, man these motherfuckers been wrong
,But it's all good I just thought I'd address it
,And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
,This is dedicated to anyone with a dream
,And a realization of what following it means
,Breaking the cycle and not following your genes
,That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
,And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems
,But if you really looking, I promise you'll find your dreams
,This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it
,The other will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
,I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time
,Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme
,I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
,But this is my therapy as I flow this
,Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice
,I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers noticed
,Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated
,But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares
,People watching every move I make like it was theirs
,All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs
,Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't trynna sell you
,Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you
,And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through
,We kept it moving, assuming even the greatest fail too
,I swear this business shit is do or die
,I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive
,In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I And every day
,This is real life, the only one we get to live
,I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
,This is real life, everything we do is legendary
,And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
,Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
,Used to feel like I was nothing, now my life has meaning
,Said this is real life, God damn this is real life
,Everything I seen, made me everything I am
,Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine
,Said, welcome to forever
,Welcome to forever
,Welcome to... forever...

,
,Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look
,Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
,You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
,You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
,You know, hardly getting sleep
,But it' the fuckin' dream though
,Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
,Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
,Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
,And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
,Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
,Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
,Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
,And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
,You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
,Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
,(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
,Man, but before I started feeling bad
,My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back"
,Fuck it
,
,Oh I could let you down
,When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,
,You be the momma, you be the daddy
,Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
,Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
,Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
,Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
,Never got head while flaming up the blunt
,You were my first, I'm just saying
,More folks should try it, it's crazy
,Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
,Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
,Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
,And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
,Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
,Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says
,Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
,We good over here, that's all that we know
,
,Oh I could let you down
,When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,
,To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
,Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
,I'm like why nigga, why?
,You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
,He like "ahhh"
,Fuck it, we about to do therapy
,Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
,You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
,I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
,But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
,It’s probably more entertaining
,Than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
,Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
,Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas too old to
,Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
,Even though he's on target for everything I've been missing
,The closest thing I had to that came in
,That 4AM in and out at 8 for work
,And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
,That's what makes it worse
,
,Oh I could let you down
,When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
,You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
,With this crazy, crazy world
,Thank God I'm with my girl
,
,It'is the sense of touch.
,what?
,In any real city you walk, you know?
,you brush past people and people, Peoele bump into you
,In L.A. noboday touches you.
,we're aways behind this metal and glass.
,I think we miss that touch so much.
,That we"Crash" into each other, just so we can feel something.
,You guys ok?
,I think he hit his head.
,You don't think that's true? true? true?
,She's been my friend for ten years. ha. ha..
,All right, honey. Feel better
,I'll be there soon
,I love you,
,I love you too.

,giving some love to a love one coming home
,reading a book and leaming new things i didn't know
,walkin' slow with a close friend share in time

,Yeah yo yo.
,I was a young cat listening to Snoop and Dre
,Trying to memorize the words that they used to say
,It's like this and like that and like this and uh
,It's like that and like this and like that and uh
,That was back in 92, I was only 10, holding pens
,Back before rap was all about the bling
,I was a young prince kickin' my style
,Not knowing one day I'd be the king of my town
,Now, sittin' around just blazin' them pounds
,At the age of 15
,Rap was only a dream
,Then a brother got a demo
,And some money to settle
,Now I'm 20 years young
,And the best where I'm from
,
,
,Yo. I remember 88 with the backspin
,Back when it was more to hip-hop then rappin'
,Back when everybody spit it with a passion
,Time, time, time, time for some action
,Back when Iron Mike Tyson was the one to be
,Marley Marl and Pete Rock had hottest beats
,Queen Latifah had the video for human teeth
,Around the time that crack fucked up the community
,It was the golden age era for rap
,Nothing like now-a-days with all these terrible cats
,Listening to Kane and to Kool G, it's a wrap
,Everytime you bought an album you just knew it was fat
,Way back, before I had the Sony walkman with playback
,Before I had the A deck, Hydro and a hayracks
,Before the invention of DVD's
,And KRS put it down for the BDP
,
,
,Back in the days when I was young i'm not a kid anymore
,But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
,Eating Skittles and digging in the fridge again
,Back when the doc said that Term needed some Idelin
,On a mission and trying to get them dividends
,Back when I spit for anybody that was listenin'
,Remember pitchin' and a dollar for a nickle and
,In 95 Mobb Deep had The Infamous
,As a young kid, it was a bad influence
,I had the police trying to take my fingerprints
,Cash rules everything around me - CREAM get the money
,4-5-6 give me that 20
,That was the hot shit gettin' funds playin' dice
,Spending our studio time and adding ice
,So I can relate to The Roots man they said it right
,Hip-hop your the love of my life, like
,
,"Gangstarr"
,Is real hip-hop and uh
,"KRS-One"
,That's real hip-hop and uh
,"Rakim"
,Is real hip-hop and uh
,"Public Enemy"
,That's real hip-hop and uh
,"Kool G Rap and Polo"
,That's real hip-hop and uh
,"A Tribe Called Quest"
,That's real hip-hop and uh
,"Big Daddy Kane"
,That's real hip-hop and uh
,"Ed O.G."
,That's realHip-hop - x8
,
,Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight
,I never knew the world could be this mad
,Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
,And I never knew the world could be this cold
,Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
,But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
,They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
,From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
,She said that orifice morph into abortions without precaution
,Problem with our people, there's too many wanna-be Jordan
,Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
,Too many wanna-be actors instead of achieving their masters
,At least a bachelors but no, too many wanna-be rappers
,That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
,Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
,On Jim Crow Laws, you probably missed it
,Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
,So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
,
,
,Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
,Look them in the eye, If looks made you die, you know you merk 'em
,Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
,So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like, quite scared
,But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
,So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
,And don't you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
,Just let 'em disappear the night air, yea with your Nike Airs
,Ride by the crackheads, left alone in the apartment
,Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
,Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
,Since he gain knowledge,I'm keeping it with the synopsis, and
,Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
,To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
,Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
,The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
,And again, and again, and again...
,
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
,So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
,
,
,
,
,Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
,Po' never, blow Berettas 'Cause I know no better
,No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
,No school, no OG, no talent, no me
,What if I just ain't act right?
,What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
,The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
,And give my friends the back knife, 'Cause "That's life, nigga"
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
,So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
,

,"Like Water"(Feat.Capital STEEZ , CJ Fly & Joey BADA$$)
,They say signs of the end is near
,And I quote, we came like them niggas in boats
,Still think it's a joke, your third eye vision is broke
,We lifted from smoke and floating, that's how I got my aura open
,Check the horoscopes, though; you could say I'm horror scoping
,You catch me floating on a four-leaf clover
,That's the pot of gold so we sonnin' them like Maury Povich
,We gone need paternity tests I guess
,Cause them vets ain't learning it step-by-step
,It's Beast Coast, we the murderous set
,We raining fire, and I don't mean the burners and techs
,You gotta love it, all 47 of us
,You ain't got a number, then I guess we gotta get you covered
,I'm connecting to my brethren with the
,West side connection cause he say he got the best there
,We got the birds like 2-4-7
,So I'm a hit you back in a second, cause we already
,Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, you dreamt it
,We lived it, we lived it, we lived it, so we already
,Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
,We lived it, we lifted
,Said you could run, but my niggas will still erase ya
,Everywhere I go, they just copy and paste us
,Pace yourself, wanksta you ain't like that ain't ya? Kerosene for your
,Chaser, waste yourself, and thank your boy
,Shots on me, I'm not drunk, let me explain my story
,I'm not under, I'm higher than who my connect employ
,Said for sure he got fire, most dankest, take a whiff
,The gracious, he never lace the shit, take a trip
,To the astrals, welcome to my land
,It's your first OBE? Tell me how has your body been?
,Spinning wheels on the axle of my embodiment,
,Don't waste your breath, you can't BS, we know what your body meant
,Through third eye codes, your third eye closed
,If Steve Jobs made you purchase a third iPhone
,All seeing eyes know what eye means
,But 33 degrees can't make us freeze
,Said they watered us down so they forced to believe
,That they won us through force and greed
,Eye said they warning us now so of course they need to be
,Wanting a force to lead
,They watered us down so they forces believe
,That they won us through force and greed
,Said we already lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
,We lived it
,I'm opening up my chakras; it's potent enough I chop it
,I'm pointing out all impostors plotting to block my commas, trying to calm us
,Down, but it ain't happening, we mad as shit
,Still managing, girl can I bust if I got cannabis?
,A half a zip could have her pants unzipped
,Ain't enough romantic shit, so don't be sadden if you couldn't have a kiss
,I'm still a bastard kid with blackened lips; I'm still a
,Pacifist, but if you ask for it, then I could pass a fist
,You don't smoke -ism, I'll introduce you, not a buddah
,Abuser, feel like a Bad Boy when I take two puffs, I and I
,Be stoned so Mary Jane is like Medusa, had keys
,For dough, would have thought he was a super, but that's when I grew up
,To realize I'm in a place to be
,Made vacancy and still the emcee, they know they can't see, we part of the
,Resistance, we'll fix things, persistence, we shifting
,We drifting, we lifted
,From the spliff that I lift -
,From the spliff that I lift -
,From the spliff that I lift and inhale
,by og
,
,Could be wrong but I think
,When you take center stage not a single eye blinks
,Some forced to squint
,In an awkward attempt
,To somehow filter your glow
,But you know...
,That the polish of your armor got'em in a trance
,Colors intertwine with the power of a dance
,Poetry in motion got'em in a stand still
,Eyes glaze over, jaws drop like anvils
,A feeling you're wishing that even time can't kill
,Sorry to inform you but it can and will
,So make the most of it
,And folks love it
,Is it the bare essentials
,Or the bells and whistles
,Can't tell initially but what remains
,When a fella's history is it the name
,That fades like memories
,Time will tell
,You know that the divine's design prevails
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,We're running out of time and it's funny I guess
,'Cause we strive to make something that it is truly timeless
,That'll never tarnish
,And maintain it's beauty
,But is that the nature of time?
,They say that we got 15 minutes to shine
,But it's all relative
,'Cause 15 minutes can feel like forever if
,We don't believe that time flies
,But you that most are blind to The Inner Minds Eye
,Where people come and go with a blink
,And celebrate your memory and toast with a drink
,Making your exit as their next thought enters
,You've made your deposit in their memory bank
,Hoping one day eventually to gain interest
,Instead of drawing blanks whenever your name's mentioned
,Hot today tomorrow you're cold & lonely
,Tell me where will these songs be...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Where will you go (go)
,Will you be long forgotten by the people you know (know)
,When you've lost your glow (glow)
,No one at the show (show)
,And your record stop spinning and you're feeling real low (low)
,When the luster fades
,Where will you go (go)
,Will you be long forgotten by the people you know (know)
,When you've lost your glow (glow)
,No one at the show (show)
,And your record stop spinning and you're feeling real low (low)
,When the luster fades
,Where will the entourage go?
,What will you do if eternal bonds are not so?
,How many women stayed when the money got low?
,When the fans seen it all, will they scream bravo
,Or have a moment of silence, minus the reflection
,Will your records be a valued part of their collection
,In a frame on the wall or end up in a dollar bin
,Will you be forgotten or honored...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy

深夜的台灯，照亮孤独的星；
每个寂寞的星球，忽远忽近，
互相围绕，擦肩而过，
吸引排斥，不断的故事；
遗憾的是分开的那么多，
我们都开始不说话。
其实我们都曾经因为爱上一颗星星，
不再惧怕黑夜。
Good Night

,lovely
,I can't believe you love me
,Your warm chest beats under me
,This feeling is too good
,love
,you love me you love you love
,love
,you love me you love you love
,It was all a dream
,I used to read Word Up magazine
,Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
,Hangin' pictures on my wall
,Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
,I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
,Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
,Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
,With the hat to match
,Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh
,You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
,Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
,Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
,Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
,Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
,Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
,Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
,I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
,Call the crib, same number same hood
,It's all good
,Uh, and if you don't know, now you know
,I made the change from a common thief
,To up close and personal with Robin Leach
,And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
,Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
,The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
,Girls used to diss me
,Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
,I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
,I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
,Now honies play me close like butter played toast
,From the Mississippi down to the east coast
,Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
,Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
,Livin' life without fear
,Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
,Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
,Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
,Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
,And it's still all good

,can i kiss you ?
,
,
,
,
,
,We are the music makers
,And we are the dreamers of dreams
,Once upon a time my heart was still
,I would walk these streets and end up nowhere
,Once upon a dream you were my thrill
,Once upon a dream you were my thrill
,I could never think of love without you
,
,My life was so complicated
,Playing cool’s so overrated
,All we got to do is spend some time
,
,We could make a quiet exit
,Slip away in a minute
,We’ll forget what was maybe just because
,Come on baby lets waste some time
,
,Here beneath the moon and starry sky
,My hearts beating for you like a samba
,
,Let the music play my radio
,We could rescue love with just one kiss oh…
,
,All the things we could uncover
,One thing could lead to another
,Anybody here could plainly see
,We could make a quiet exit
,Slip away in a minute
,We’ll forget what was maybe just because
,Come on baby lets waste some time
,
,All the things we could uncover
,One thing could lead to another
,Anybody here could plainly see
,We could make a quiet exit
,Slip away in a minute
,We’ll forget what was maybe just because
,Come on baby lets waste some time
,
,lets waste some time
,
,waste some time
,waste some time
,
,
,Instead of feeling bad
,Be glad you got somewhere to go
,Instead of feeling sad
,Be happy you're not all alone
,Instead of feeling low
,Get high on everything you love
,Instead of wasting time
,Feel good about what
,
,You are dreaming of
,Instead of trying to win something
,You never understood
,Just play the game you know eventually
,You never good
,It's silly to pretend to you have
,Something you don't own
,Just let her be a woman
,
,And you'll be her man
,Instead of feeling broke
,Buck up and get yourself
,In the black
,Instead of losing hope
,Touch up the things that
,Feel out of whack
,Instead of being old
,
,Be young because you know you are

,Both Sides Now
,- Judy Collins
,
,Rows and floes of angel hair
,And ice cream castles in the air
,And feather canyons everywhere
,I`ve looked at clouds that way
,
,But now they only block the sun
,They rain and snow on everyone
,So many things I would have done
,But clouds got in my way
,
,I`ve looked at clouds from both sides now
,From up and down, and still somehow
,It`s cloud illusions I recall
,I really don`t know clouds at all
,(-------- Misic --------)
,Moons and junes and ferris wheels
,The dizzy dancing way you feel
,As every fairy tale comes real
,I`ve looked at love that way
,
,But now it`s just another show
,You leave them laughing when you go
,And if you care, don`t let them know
,Don`t give yourself away
,
,I`ve looked at love from both sides now
,From give and take, and still somehow
,It`s loves illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,Tears and fears and feeling proud
,To say I love you right out loud
,Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
,I`ve looked at life that way
,
,But now old friends are acting strange
,They shake their heads,They say I`ve changed
,Somethings lost
,Somethings gainedIn living every day
,
,I`ve looked at life from both sides now
,From win and lose and still somehow
,It`s lifes illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,
,And now the purple dusk of twilight time
,Steals across the meadows of my heart
,High up in the sky the little stars climb
,Always reminding me that we're apart
,You wander down the lane and far away
,Leaving me a song that will not die
,Love is now the stardust of yesterday
,The music of the years gone by
,Sometimes I wonder why I spend
,The lonely night dreaming of a song
,The melody haunts my reverie
,And I am once again with you
,When our love was new
,And each kiss an inspiration
,But that was long ago
,Now my consolation
,Is in the stardust of a song
,Beside a garden wall
,When stars are bright
,You are in my arms
,The nightingale tells his fairy tale
,A paradise where roses bloom
,Though I dream in vain
,in my heart it always will remain
,My stardust melody
,The memory of love's refrain
,
,
,Feelin' low
,Rockin' slow
,I want to go
,Right back where I belong
,Way down south in Birmingham
,I mean south in Alabam' s
,There's an old place where people go
,To dance the night away
,They all drive or walk for miles
,To get jive that southern style
,It's an old jive that makes you want
,To dance till break of day
,It's a junction where the town folks meet
,At each function in a tux they greet you
,Come on down, forget your care
,Come on down, you'll find me there
,So long town, I'm heading for
,Tuxedo Junction now

,And laughed at by the Gods

, 作曲 : Clark, Loren
,Mine was a blue world
,until you came along
,thought I was through
,Singing a melanchoy song
,Now the tune is the same
,And every word's coming true
,Guess that'the danger
,in loving you
,Just like a silly moth
,That can't seem to learn
,I keep running back
,Although I know it's gonna burn
,Sometimes I hate myself
,But what can i do
,I'm drawn to the danger
,And loving you
,I can't fight your devil charms
,When you take me in your arms
,And you lead me into harm's way
,I'm a captive in the game you play
,I can't fight your devil charms
,When you take me in your arms
,And you lead me into harm's way
,I'm a captive in the game you play
,I'm like a gambler
,In this round of roulette
,'Cept it's my heart
,That I've got riding on a bet
,How long will it take
,Before you break it in two
,It's all in the danger in loving you
,It's all in the danger in loving you
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
,And to reach the highest peak,
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek,
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you;
,The charm about you
,Will carry me thro' to Heaven
,I'm in Heaven,
,and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Come on and Dance with me, i want my arms about you
,That charm about you
,Will carry me through
,Right up to Heaven, I'm in Heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing
,Out together dancing
,When we're out together dancing
,Cheek to cheek
,Oh, yeah!
,
,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old Winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When Autumn leaves start to fall
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When Autumn leaves start to fall

,この空の下で　君と出会った
,瞳の輝きに　心ゆらめく
,眠れない夜　胸が苦しい
,触れ合う度に　トキが止まった
,どこまでも　そうどんな時も
,君だけの愛が　色褪せる事ない
,あの夜に誓うよ　もう迷わせない
,例え離れても　光を失くしても
,I Believe　I Believe
,I Believe　この愛を…今
,キミに全て捧げる!
,I Believe　I Believe
,Just I Believe　永遠に
,愛している…　何が起きても
,キミを見失っても…　I Believe
,僕の隣で　眠りにつけば…いい
,キミのその寝息さえ…　愛おしくなる
,これからも　何年過ぎても
,キミの温もりが　消える事などない
,そう信じてるのに…　キミが薄れてく
,この手伸ばしても　僕をすり抜けてく
,I Believe　I Believe
,I Believe　悲しみは…今
,2人で分け合えばいい!
,I Believe　I Believe
,Just I Believe　その全て愛してる
,離しはしない…　もう離したくない
,I Believe
,やっと巡り合えたから　
,もうキミを失くしたくない
,この声が枯れても　星空に願うから…
,流れるその涙は　ボクの胸にこぼせばいい
,キミの傍に居るよ
,I Believe　I Believe
,I Believe　この愛を…今
,キミに全て捧げる!
,I Believe　I Believe

,And in between I drink, black coffee
,Love's a hand-me-down brew
,I'll never know a Sunday
,In this weekday room

,And Lord, how slow the moments go
,When all I do is pour, black coffee
,Since the blues caught my eye
,I'm hangin' out on Monday
,My Sunday dreams to dry
,Now man is born to go a lovin
,A woman's born to weep and fret
,To stay at home and tend her oven
,And down her past regrets in coffee and cigarettes
,I'm moonin' all the mornin', moanin' all the night
,And in between it's nicotine
,And not much heart to fight, black coffee
,Feelin' low as the ground
,It's drivin' me crazy this waiting for my baby
,To maybe come around

,It's life you see
,When i have tried to amuse myself
,To celebrate the fun fair
,The pleasures i seek
,Are far too discreet for me
,And all the time
,The world unwinds
,I can't deny the way i feel
,The truth is lost beyond this lonely carousel
,And all these words
,They mean nothing at all
,Just a cruel remedy
,A strange tragedy
,Of what will be
,After i tried
,To discover the answers to why
,To look for a meaning
,Inside of this dreaming i had
,And words that i've said
,Are spinning 'round
,Would sing alone inside my head
,Nothing will change
,It's always the same

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't tell me I'm wrong
 And what a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along
 
 Moonlight becomes - it goes with your hair
 You certainly know the right thing to wear
 
 Moonlight becomes you - I'm thrilled at the sight
 And I could get so romantic tonight
 
 You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't you tell me I'm wrong
 What a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along
 
 And if I say: "I love you" - I want you to know
 It's not just because there's moonlight - although
 Moonlight becomes you so

Funny, how i've stopped loving you
I can pass you on the street and my heart don't skip a beat
Not much, so much my eyes wanna cry
Funny, how i've stopped loving you
I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame
Not much, so much my heart wants to die
Now that you're standing here, darling, i don't shed a tear
This is just the rain in my eyes
And if i have proved to you everything i say is true
Please help me believe my own lies
Funny, how i've stopped loving you
And it's funny i don't miss all the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, no i don't love you, not much
Funny, how i've stopped loving you
And it's funny i don't miss all the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, no i don't love you, not much
No i don't love you, not much
It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra new
It's very subtle, the Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to rhythm and romance
It's quite a fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your love
Everybody swinging the Continental
And you're a-saying just what you're thinking of
So keep on dancing the Continental
For it's the song of romance and of love
You kiss while you're dancing
It's Continental, , Continental
You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and sentimental
You'll find before oh the dance is through
Oh that you're in love with her and she's in love with you
You'll find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to rhythm and romance
It's quite a fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
Your lips whisper so tenderly
Her eyes answer your love
Continental, so keep on dancing the Continental
For it's the song of romance and of love
You'll find before otheroh the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you
I know you'll find while you're dancing
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
While there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time
The Continental, the Continental

,Goodbye,no  use  leading  with  our  chins
,This  is  where  our  story  ends
,Never  lovers,ever  friends
,Goodbye,let  our  hearts  call  it  a  day
,But  before  you  walk  away
,I  sincerely  want  to  say
,I  wish  you  bluebirds  in  the  spring
,To  give  your  heart  a  song  to  sing
,And  then  a  kiss,but  more  than  this
,I  wish  you  love
,And  in  july  a  lemonade
,To  cool  you  in  some  leafy  glade
,I  wish  you  health
,But  more  than  wealth
,I  wish  you  love
,My  breaking  heart  and  I  agree
,That  you  and  I  could  never  be
,So  with  my  best
,My  very  best
,I  set  you  free
,I  wish  you  shelter  from  the  storm
,A  cozy  fire  to  keep  you  warm
,But  most  of  all  when  snowflakes  fall
,I  wish  you  love

Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty? wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, i choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee
I'd feel so rich in a hut for two
Two rooms and kitchen i'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand
When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be,
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keep to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
Did you say the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the others more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over
Don't you wishty'd go on forever?
Don't you wishty'd go on forever?
Don't you wishty'd go on forever and you'd never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill,
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!

Miss otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today.
Madam...
Miss otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today.
She is sorry to be delayed,
But last evening down at lover's lane, she strayed.
Madam...
Miss otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today.
~interlude~
When she woke from her dream
And found that her love had gone,
Madam...
She ran to the man
Who had led her so far astray.
And from under her velvet gown,
She drew a gun and shot her lover down.
Madam...
Miss otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today.
Then the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail.
Madam...
They strung her upon
A willow across the way.
And the moment before she died,
She lifted up her lovely head and cried.
Madam...
Miss otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today.
This is a song was sung back
In eighteen and ninety two
There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had
Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows
Goats and everything they had on their farm
And they would start crying
And singing this song
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone
Then they would go out hunting rabbits
'Coons and 'possums
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something
Then again they didn't
And when they would come home
They would find flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them
And they would start crying
And singing this song
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Then they would start out looking for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards
And they would find axes, wood
That Joe Turner had brought there for them
Then they would get happy
And start singing and crying this song
They would get happy
And do a little boogie woogie too

,What do you think love is, Chuck?
,Well, years ago, my dad owned a black 1934, two-door sedan.
,What’s that got to do with love?
,Well, this is what he told me: there was this really cute girl, see?
,She used to go for rides with him in his car.
,And whenever he’d call for her, he would always hold open the car door for her.
,After she got in and he had closed the door,
,He’d walk around the back of the car to the driver’s side,
,But before he could get there,
,She would reach over and press the button, locking him out.
,Then she’d just sit there and wrinkle her nose and grin at him.
,That’s what I think love is.
,That’s what I think love is.
,Enjoy~
,- Are you leaving?
,- Yes.
,- For long?
,- Forever.
,- Where will you go?
,- Where I belong. Away from mankind.
,- I think you are the most human man I... I have ever known.
,Well I was there on the day
,They sold the cause for the queen,
,And when the lights all went out
,We watched our lives on the screen.
,I hate the ending myself,
,But it started with an alright scene.
,- There is no place far enough.
,I've lost the immortal part of myself, you see.
,It was the roar of the crowd
,That gave me heartache to sing.
,It was a lie when they smiled
,And said, "you won't feel a thing"
,and as we ran from the cops
,We laughed so hard it would sting
,I spent my high school career
,Spit on and shoved to agree
,So I could watch all my heroes
,Sell a car on tv
,We've got the obvious team,
,we'll show 'em what we all mean.
,Yeah yeah, oh
,- This dream I had... this...
,this long dream of kinship with those unlike me...
,it is gone.

,I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping,
,still my guitar, gently weeps.
,I don't know why, nobody told you,
,how to unfold your love.

,I don't know how, someone controlled you,
,they bought and sold you.
,I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning,
,while my guitar, gently weeps.
,With every mistake, we must surely, be learning,
,still my guitar, gently weeps
,
,I don't know how, you were diverted,
,you were perverted, too.
,I don't know how, you were inverted,
,no one alerted you.

,As her car pulls out the driveway

,I’m standing here watching her tail lights
,As if they’re some kind of sign

,I just got tired of trying
,So long, i hate to see you go
,So i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i keep i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,Two days later i get a letter
,A picture of a room in some hotel
,Sitting framed up on the table,
,A picture i know so well
,You’ve painted yourself in to a corner
,Now you’re trying to paint something new
,And your lipstick on the letter
,Is a goodbye kiss from you
,So long, i hate to see you go
,but i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i keep i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,I still set the table
,Still set it for you and me

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end
,Always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
,
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing

James Taylor - Wichita Lineman



I am a lineman for the county,
and I drive the main road
searchin' in the sun for another overload.

I hear you singin' in the wires,
I can hear you through the whine,
and the Wichita lineman is still on the line.

I know I need a small vacation
but it doesn't look like rain
and if it snows that stretch down south
will never be the same.

And I need you more than want you,
and I want you for all time,
and the Wichita lineman is still on the line.

And I need you more than want you,
and I want you for all time,
and the Wichita lineman is still on the line.
Still on the line.
Still on the line.
Still on the line.
Still on the line.
Lineman is still on the line.
(Donny)
Our time, short and precious
Your lips, warm and luscious
You don't have to wear false charms
'Cause when i wrap you in my hungry arms
Be real black for me
Be real black for me
(Roberta)
Your hair, soft and crinkly
Your body, strong and stately
You don't have to search and roam
'Cause I got your love at home
Be real black for me
Be real black for me
(both)
In my head i'm only half together
If i lose you, i'd be ruined forever
Darling, take my hand and hold me
Hold me 
Hold me 
Hold me 
Hold me 
(alternated)
You know how much i need you
To have you, really feel you
(both)
You don't have to change a thing
No one knows the love you bring
Be real black for me 
Be real black for me 
Be real black for me

Martin
Maybe 21st's not the right time
Maybe my expectation was a little bit high
Or maybe cos i was still drunk since may
Or between us there is nothing to say
To be frank i have forgotten your voice
To be honest i can't even remember your face
Somehow in my heart you've occupied a place
Every now and then you make me fall
You bring me sore
So by the time you came passing by
I knew it was all designed
I knew there's no place where i could hide
You know i can't decide
You know i can't deny
So by the time you give me a smell
And then you left me behind
Oh martin you messed it all up
 how you took me up into the sky
let me fall and let me cry
All along    All along
All along i'd been waiting for your call
After all just a simple lie is nothing at all
but you've decided not to call anyway
Cos between us there is really nothing to say
So by the time you came passing by
I knew it was all designed
I knew there's no place where i could hide
You know i can't decide
You know i can't deny
So by the time you came kissing me
You know you're confusing me
Oh martin you know it's all wrong
how you threw me up into the sky
Shot me down and said goodbye
goodbye
goodbye

,Barbra Streisand - You Must Believe In Spring
,
,When lonely feelings chill
,The meadows of your mind,
,Just think if Winter comes,
,Can Spring be far behind?
,Beneath the deepest snows,
,The secret of a rose
,Is merely that it knows
,You must believe in Spring!
,
,Just as a tree is sure
,Its leaves will reappear;
,It knows its emptiness
,Is just the time of year
,The frozen mountain dreams
,Of April's melting streams,
,How crystal clear it seems,
,You must believe in Spring!
,
,......
,You must believe in Spring
,You must believe in love
,And trust it's on its way,
,Just as the sleeping rose
,Awaits the kiss of May
,
,So in a world of snow,
,Of things that come and go,
,Where what you think you know,
,You can't be certain of,
,You must believe in Spring and love
,
,Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
,You've been out ridin' fences,
,for so long - now.
,Ohh you're a hard one.
,I know that you've got your reasons.
,These things that are pleasin'you
,Can hurt you somehow.
,
,Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
,She'll beat you if she's able.
,You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
,Now it seems to me, some fine things
,Have been laid upon your table.
,But you only want the ones
,That you can't get.
,
,Desperado,
,Ohhhh you aint getting no younger.
,Your pain and your hunger,
,They're driving you home.
,And freedom, ohh freedom.
,Well that's just some people talking.
,Your prison is walking through this world all alone.
,
,Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
,The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine.
,It's hard to tell the night time from the day.
,And you're losing all your highs and lows
,aint it funny how the feeling goes
,away...
,
,Desperado,
,Why don't you come to your senses?
,come down from your fences, open the gate.
,It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you.
,You better let somebody love you.
,(let sombody love you)
,You better let somebody love you
,before it's too late.

You ain't been blue; no, no, no.
You ain't been blue,
Till you've had that mood indigo.
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, "Go 'long blues".
Always get that mood indigo,
Since my baby said goodbye.
In the evenin' when lights are low,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me,
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be.
When I get that mood indigo,
I could lay me down and die.
Wanderlust

Artist(Band):Nightwish

I want to see where the sirens sing
Hear how the wolves howl
Sail the dead calm waters of the Pacific
Dance in the fields of coral
Be blinded by the white
Discover the deepest jungle
I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart
It`s not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust
I want to love by the Blue Lagoon

I want to love by the Blue Lagoon
Kiss under the waning moon
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil
Riding the dolphins
Asking the mountains
Dreaming Alaska
The Earth can have but Earth
I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart
It`s not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust
Drown into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
Drown into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
Rhythm Of The Rain

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be along again
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a aband new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away
When she don't care I can't love another
When my heart's somewhere far away
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a aband new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart
~music~
Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be along again
Oh listen to the falling rain

,When the sun is high
,in the afternoon sky
,You can always
,find something to do;
,But from dusk til dawn,
,as the clock ticks on,
,Something happens to you.
,In the wee small hours
,of the morning
,While the whole wide
,world is fast asleep
,You lie awake and
,think about the girl
,And never ever think
,of counting sheep
,When your lonely heart
,has learned its lesson
,You'd be hers
,if only she would call
,In the wee small
,hours of the morning
,That's the time
,you miss her most of all

,Heaven, i'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
,And i seem to find the happiness i seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Heaven, i'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh i love to climb a mountain
,And to reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh i love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek
,But i don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me, i want my arms about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through to heaven
,Heaven, i'm in heaven
,Heaven, i'm in heaven

梧桐把自然光遮蔽地剩下一些斑点

街边的法式建筑已经爬满藤蔓

下雨的时候，来来往往看不真切的过客

听不见我外面冰冷内里炽热的节奏

6路公交站台，我抛开雨伞

手指在空气中跳着舞
,
,When you gave me back the key
,that's when I realized it's over
,I wanna keep everything in frames
,Will you keep on loving me?
,though I'll move on love someone else
,Hateful thought,dictating my mind
,
,The reason why we're in
,(in this quiet empty room)
,is tangled,it's not pretty
,(Words can never catch up on this)
,Our past,present,and our future
,could never win being greedy
,Unselfish love found no place in me
,Hurting you hurts me more
,Loving you has to stop
,How could I ever start to forget you?
,You will never know
,why I have to leave you
,why I can't open up my heart
,why I choose this life over you
,Let it rain on me,
,so that you won't see my tears
,trust me baby it's not for your love
,"I will never lie"
,So just keep believing me
,So that I'll forever be
,so called clean and pure in your heart
,It's time to say bye to your love
,One foot in,that was enough
,doors behind me were compeletly shut
,I could not look at your eyes straight
,Two words left for me to say
,"Good-bye"
,The longgest,the biggeset,the heaviest meaning hiding behind it
,
,What I've been looking for
,was not this kind for sure
,but life moves on without my confirm
,You will never know
,why I have to leave you
,why I can't open up my heart
,why I choose this life over you
,Let it rain on me,
,so that you won't see my tears
,trust me baby it's not for your love
,"I will never lie"
,So just keep believing me
,So that I'll forever be
,so called clean and pure in your heart
,It's time to say bye to your love
,
,Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight
,I never knew the world could be this mad
,Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
,And I never knew the world could be this cold
,Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
,But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
,They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
,From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
,She said that orifice morph into abortions without precaution
,Problem with our people, there's too many wanna-be Jordan
,Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
,Too many wanna-be actors instead of achieving their masters
,At least a bachelors but no, too many wanna-be rappers
,That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
,Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
,On Jim Crow Laws, you probably missed it
,Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
,So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
,
,
,Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
,Look them in the eye, If looks made you die, you know you merk 'em
,Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
,So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like, quite scared
,But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
,So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
,And don't you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
,Just let 'em disappear the night air, yea with your Nike Airs
,Ride by the crackheads, left alone in the apartment
,Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
,Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
,Since he gain knowledge,I'm keeping it with the synopsis, and
,Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
,To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
,Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
,The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
,And again, and again, and again...
,
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
,So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
,
,
,
,
,Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
,Po' never, blow Berettas 'Cause I know no better
,No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
,No school, no OG, no talent, no me
,What if I just ain't act right?
,What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
,The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
,And give my friends the back knife, 'Cause "That's life, nigga"
,
,
,It ain't easy livin' life like this
,When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
,Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices

,would it be a surprise
,I'd like it if you say it's a nice gift
,and If I were to bring you some flowers

,a white lie, to typewrite my bravado
,I know a girl named jasmine
,a face of an angel spring time to summer
,change like hues of hydrangea
,every time I see her she's fancier
,from the french hillside to lombard street
,landed on a postcard, a colorful treat
,became a platinum hit, and wouldn't you know
,if it don't wither, then it must be faux
,i remember buttercups on the way to school
,plus when we all go swimming at the pool
,picking poppy and lily in the field
,the sweet smell of gardenia
,open up the gate and there you were
,who needs a dozen roses
,when you can have gerbera and daisy
,think about you daily, karma is a feisty lady
,and If I were to bring you some flowers
,would it be a surprise
,I'd like it if you say it's a nice gift
,and If I were to bring you some flowers
,would it be a surprise
,a white lie, to typewrite my bravado
,a kiss of an orchid, I know I gotta work it
,I ain't lying, everything's dandelion
,‘cause even when I'm under the weather
,take echinacea, your cheeks, azalea
,balloon vines, bird of paradise
,narcissus, and forget me not
,by the danube, knight and his princess
,used to wish we never ran out of recess
,the pond houses kois and turtles
,the clear water reflects crape myrtles
,the day sprinkled with baby's breath
,to make a bouquet, a floral buffet
,is there an app for that?
,just kidding, I already got a knack for that
,you're my morning glory, a cute story
,I'm a flower but you're my sunflower
,and If I were to bring you some flowers
,would it be a surprise
,I'd like it if you say it's a nice gift
,and If I were to bring you some flowers
,would it be a surprise
,a white lie, to typewrite my bravado
,I want to share a future
,travel the world with seeds of fuchsia
,sounds exotic, snapdragon and snowdrops
,genera member, rare as goldilocks
,I want to go where looks don't matter
,clothes tattered and you can still flatter me
,your eyes are my batteries
,my hopes represent the ultimate security
,filter the filth and impurity
,I got the goods, whenever you're in need
,just tell me the deal and I'ma feel ya
,violet and fennel from Ophelia
,whichever stem we decide to pick apart
,sounds flow in direction of the petals
,thrown on the ground that your bare feet bless
,blades of the grass soften when you say yes
,and If I were to bring you some flowers

,
,Once again, now where do I start, dear love
,Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
,Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night,
,Sometimes still pondering the previous plight,
,Seems life done changed long time no speak,
,Nowadays I often forget the day of the week
,Taking it by stride if you know what I mean,
,No harm done, no offense taken by me
,So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps?
,Perhaps we're even closer now after all things considered on this side of the planet,
,Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it!
,To come clean and candid if I have to
,Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
,Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting,
,Even better than the real thing!
,It's like the God in me saw the Devil in you
,I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
,Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth,
,Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
,Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
,Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works,
,Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds!
,C'est la vie, as they say L.O.V.E evidently, see every song has a sequel
,Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
,C'est la vie, as they say L.O.V.E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
,Never same, you got to keep it tight, all fresh just like back then, now hear me out…
,Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
,I pray that you keep watching over us,
,From the heavens where light is the nucleus
,To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
,Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather feel when I leave this shell eventually
,Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally,
,Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
,Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
,Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
,From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love,
,Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
,Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am a man full of sin
,It's like the Devil in me saw the God in you,
,You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm!
,Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
,That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
,I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
,(Science + Arts) * Faith / # of our Ethnic Race!
,Let me mention what I've been thinking
,How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
,So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans,
,Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns!
,Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man,
,Understand the time has finally come to realize the great power of 1,
,All formulas equalize under the Sun, Amen!
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music,
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe,
,Your vibe surely brings out the best in me!
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music,
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe,
,All good souls lost may they rest in peace!
,C'est la vie, as they say L.O.V.E evidently, see every song has a sequel
,Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
,C'est la vie, as they say L.O.V.E eloquently, see every dream has a part two

,Luv(sic)
,Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
,developing this new theory of relativity
,connecting our souls resting in captivity,
,positive life sacrifice what it is to me
,our history, only a quarter of a century
,reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
,see ain't no mystery, the colours that we mix will set the mind free,
,let the blind see beyond harmony!
,breathe life into dead space blow away all clouds of doubt
,new territory we determine to be
,everything a safe haven is supposed to be
,now it might seem distant but the time is near
,when our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
,pure sound waves travel semi-infinitely,
,plus I'll see you there utmost definitely!
,'cause the beat plus the melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,'cause the beat plus the melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
,god bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
,for some words that have waited for way too long
,low wages, small tips on the avenue
,never wasted, all hits for a revenue
,haven't you heard the news lately?
,seems we've been living for sometimes in a purgatory
,but yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
,but I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
,I could still hear it in the room past midnite,
,gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
,sometimes I do forget , oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
,if we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
,return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
,so you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to express definition of grace
,but the method I choose my prerogative,
,there's so much love in me I got to give!
,'cause your beat plus my melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,'cause my beat plus your melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel,
,but how about this song that I wrote for you?
,what I feel like... I wanna put my trust in these simple words
,for you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
,reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together?
,remember the time that you told me in the cold night,
,to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
,remember the time that I spoke to a crowd in a full house and realized that you was my ace?
,I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
,all eyes on me and had nothing to prove
,but yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
,but I felt a sharper love in the limelight,
,from the queen of hearts watching me quietly in the upper deck balcony
,sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
,when I look back at that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
,now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
,for you to know that the music help us carry on,
,like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

Oh man.. hey.. let's turn this house into a happy home
 This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
 Let's turn this house into a happy home
 Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
 Let's turn this house into a happy home
 You know how that is, stay down for mine
 Outlaw.. look
 
 Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
 Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
 We divorced so many times I forgot to count
 I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
 Remember back in December when we was tight?
 Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
 Promised that I commit to you soon
 Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
 Straight out the hood
 We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
 So I know you gon' make a good mother
 Just try to understand if I change at times
 it's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
 So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
 Never call the police, I never call you bitch and ho
 We were all born hungry in this world alone
 Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home
 
 
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (let's turn this house into a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (turn this house into a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 
 Goin through hard times, ghetto child of mine
 I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
 To be honest it's a hard road
 Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
 Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
 Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
 Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
 Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
 Maybe in time I'll be a better man
 Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
 Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
 If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
 Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
 Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
 After all the arguments, and the nights alone
 Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home
 
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (turn this house into a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (finally got to live the good life, inside a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 (turn this house into a happy home)
 Ha..ppy.. home.. 
 
 Happy home
 
 All these problems got me goin
 We got a family, of our own
 I just wanna happy home
 (turn this house into a happy home)
 No man's made to stand alone
 I promise I won't do you wrong
 I just want a happy home
 (finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
 
 Ha..ppy.. home..

,Yes I think you've seen me before
,If you hear something late at night
,Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
,Just don't ask me what it was
,I think it's because I'm clumsy
,I try not to talk too loud
,Maybe it's because I'm crazy
,I try not to act too proud
,They only hit until you cry
,And after that you don't ask why
,You just don't argue anymore
,Yes I think I'm okay
,I walked into the door again
,Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
,And it's not your business anyway
,I guess I'd like to be alone
,With nothing broken, nothing thrown
,Just don't ask me how I am
,In my place, in my place
,Were lines that I couldn't change
,I was lost, oh yeah

You're up and you'll get down
You're never running from this town
Kinda think you said
You'll never get anything better than this
'Cause you're going round in circles
And everyone knows you're troubled
'Cause you read it in a big book
And now you're giving me the look look
But just remember how we shook shook
And all the things we took took
This town is the oldest friend of mine
Get up and we get down
We're always running round this town
And to think they said
We'd never make anything better than this
'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're troubled
We didn't read it in a big book
And now we're giving you the look look
Just remember how we shook shook
And all the things we took took
This town is the oldest friend of mine
This town
We want to multiply, are you gonna do it?
I know you qualify, are you gonna do it?
Don't be so circumscribed, are you gonna do it?
Just get yourself untied, are you gonna do it?
Feel the heat pushing you to decide
Feel the heat burning you up, ready or not
Some like it hot, and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot till you try
Some like it hot, so let's turn up the heat till we fry
The girl is at your side, are you gonna do it?
She wants to be your bride, are you gonna do it?
She wants to multiply, are you gonna do it?
I know you won't be satisfied until you do it
Feel the heat pushing you to decide
Feel the heat burning you up, ready or not
Some like it hot, and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot till you try

,You and I in a little toy shop
,Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
,Set them free at the break of dawn
,'Til one by one they were gone
,Back at base bugs in the software
,Flash the message "something's out there!"
,Floating in the summer sky
,Ninety-nine red balloons go by
,Ninety-nine red balloons
,Floating in the summer sky
,Panic bells, it's red alert
,There's something here from somewhere else
,The war machine springs to life
,Opens up one eager eye
,Focusing it on the sky
,Where ninety-nine red balloons go by
,Ninety-nine decision street
,Ninety-nine ministers meet
,To worry, worry, super scurry
,Call the troops out in a hurry
,This is what we've waited for
,This is it, boys, this is war
,The president is on the line
,As ninety-nine red balloons go by
,Ninety-nine knights of the air
,Ride super high-tech jet fighters
,Everyone's a super hero
,Everyone's a captain Kirk
,With orders to identify
,To clarify and classify
,Scramble in the summer sky
,As ninety-nine red balloons go
,Ninety-nine dreams I have had
,In every one a red balloon
,It's all over and I'm standing pretty
,In this dust that was a city
,If I could find a souvenir
,Just to prove the world was here
,And here is a red balloon
,I think of you, and let it go
,Cher:Believe
,
,No matter how hard I try
,You keep pushing me aside
,And I can't break through
,There's no talking to you
,It's so sad that you're leavin'
,It takes time to believe it
,But after all is said and done
,You're gonna be the lonely one
,Do you believe in life after love?
,I can feel something inside me say
,I really don't think you're strong enough now
,Do you believe in life after love?
,I can feel something inside me say
,I really don't think you're strong enough now
,What am I supposed to do
,Sit around and wait for you
,Well I can't do that
,And there's no turnin' back
,I need time to move on
,I need love to feel strong
,'Cos I've had time to think it through
,'N' maybe I'm too good for you
,Oh' do you believe in life after love?
,I can feel something inside me say
,I really don't think you're strong enough now
,Well I know that I'll get through this
,'Cos I know that I am strong
,I don't need you anymore
,I don't need you anymore
,No' I don't need you anymore
,I don't need you anymore

,So much for your promises
,They died the day you let me go
,Caught up in a web of lies
,But it was just too late to know
,I thought it was you
,Who would stand by my side
,And now you've given me, given me
,Nothing but shattered dreams,
,shattered dreams,
,Feel like I could run away, run away
,From this empty heart
,You said you'd die for me
,Woke up to reality
,And found the future not so bright
,I dreamt the impossible
,That maybe things could work out right
,I thought it was you
,Who would do me no wrong
,And now you've given me, given me
,Nothing but shattered dreams,
,shattered dreams,
,Feel like I could run away, run away
,From this empty heart
,You've given me, given me
,Nothing but shattered dreams,

We all came out to montreux
On the lake geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank zappa and the mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
,Don't go changing' To try and please me
,You never let me down before
,I Don't imagine
,You're too familiar
,And I don't see you anymore
,I would not leave you in times of trouble
,We never could have come this far' No love..
,I took the good times'
,I'll take the bad times
,I'll take you just the way you are
,Don't go trying' Some new fashion
,Don't change the color of your hair' Hea..Baby..
,You always have my unspoken passion
,Although I might not seem to care
,I don't want clever conversation
,Don't want to work that far' No love..
,I just want some someone to talk to
,I want you just the way you are
,I need to know that you will always be
,The same old someone that I knew
,What will it take till you believe in me
,The way that I believe in you' Hea......
,I...I said I love you that's forever
,This I promise from my heart' Oh..love..
,I could not love you any better
,I love you just the way you are
,I don't want clever conversation
,I don't want to work that far' No..love..
,I just want some someone to talk to
,I want you just the way you are
,I want to the way you are
,Don't go changing...........
I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?
The stars are out and shining
But all I really want to know...
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part
Someone thought of healing
But all I really want to know...
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way
I want you day after day
I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me
I watch you when you're sleeping

,There's a lady who's sure
,All that glitters is gold
,And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
,When she gets there she knows
,If the stores are all closed
,With a word she can get what she came for.
,Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
,There's a sign on the wall
,But she wants to be sure
,'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
,In a tree by the brook
,There's a songbird who sings,
,Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
,Ooh, it makes me wonder,
,Ooh, it makes me wonder.
,There's a feeling I get
,When I look to the west,
,And my spirit is crying for leaving.
,In my thoughts I have seen
,Rings of smoke through the trees,
,And the voices of those who stand looking.
,Ooh, it makes me wonder,
,Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
,And it's whispered that soon
,If we all call the tune
,Then the piper will lead us to reason.
,And a new day will dawn
,For those who stand long
,And the forests will echo with laughter.
,If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
,Don't be alarmed now,
,It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
,Yes, there are two paths you can go by
,But in the long run
,There's still time to change the road you're on.
,And it makes me wonder.
,Your head is humming and it won't go
,In case you don't know,
,The piper's calling you to join him,
,Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
,And did you know
,Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
,And as we wind on down the road
,Our shadows taller than our soul.
,There walks a lady we all know
,Who shines white light and wants to show
,How ev'rything still turns to gold.
,And if you listen very hard
,The tune will come to you at last.
,When all are one and one is all
,To be a rock and not to roll.
,And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

,I still press your letters to my lips
,And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
,I couldn't face a life without your light
,But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
,So save your breath, I will not hear.
,I think I made it very clear.
,You couldn't hate enough to love.
,Is that supposed to be enough?
,I only wish you weren't my friend.
,Then I could hurt you in the end.
,I never claimed to be a Saint…
,My own was banished long ago
,It took the Death of Hope to let you go
,So Break Yourself Against My Stones
,And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
,You Never Needed Any Help
,You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
,And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
,You Ran Away - You're All The Same
,Angels Lie To Keep Control…
,My Love Was Punished Long Ago
,If You Still Care, Don't Ever Let Me Know
,If you still care, don't ever let me know…

,他坐在大屏幕的前面
,搜索频道
,揣着一颗幽怨亢奋的心
,大门紧闭
,对别人
,他滔滔不绝
,沉迷沾稠的喉咙
,对冷漠
,也羞愧 只是
,他爱真相 自由 却谁都不爱
,只为错过 参与历史而忏悔
,他雄壮的梦 正对着贫瘠的手
,听从远古的咒语
,陷入在灵与肉的交战
,从未停止
,身边亲人耳边堆积的誓言
,灰尘满布
,真善美
,也还看得见
,也会感动掉眼泪
,假敬虔
,也不难 只是
,他爱亲情 美德 却谁都不爱
,只为付出 多了一丝而后悔
,他雄壮的梦 正对着贫瘠的手
,听从远古的咒语
,身体中
,另有个律
,在和圣洁交战
,愿为善
,却有恶 同在
,那些思念愿景都不见踪影
,只有良心诫命不断的控诉
,他雄壮的梦 正对着贫瘠的手
,听从远古的咒语
,所以立志为善由得我
,可是行出来却 由不得我
,我所不愿意的恶 我倒去做
,到底谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢
,除非他已经胜过死亡
,你走的时候没有带走美猴王的画像
,说要把他留在花果山之上
,行囊也只有空空的酒杯和游戏机
,门外金沙般的阳光它撒了一地
,再不见风样的少年格子衬衫一角扬起
,从此寂寞了的白塔后山今夜悄悄落雨
,未东去的黄河水打上了刹那的涟漪
,千里之外的高楼上的你彻夜未眠
,
,兰州~总是在清晨里出走
,兰州~夜晚温暖的醉酒
,兰州~淌不完的黄河水向东流
,兰州~路的尽头是海的入口

,是否每天忙碌只为一顿饭
,是否幻想里只有绫络绸缎
,是否爱人已爱成了一个伴儿
,是否半夜里心痒痒地直蹭炕沿儿

,岁月一年年收获的比醋还酸
,幸福像在天上磨磨叽叽不下凡
,花花绿绿的危险时刻就在你身边儿

,If I had my chance
,Would I risk it all
,Would I dare to leave everything behind me
,A moment to let go
,A mirror to find you hiding inside
,A story to hold on
,To overcome inside me
,It's 2014-I consider my future
,Tapping deep thoughts in the soul of computers
,I used to think when I'm hold I'll be super
,Influence hearts like a soulful producer
,We're told to be ambitious-believe me
,The world is viscous- it squeezed me
,Of hopes and plans that would see me
,Breathe poetry as I seek peace
,HSBC holds the key now
,To my life plans and the dream house
,To the right man and to be proud
,Stability-that's what we seek out
,And I speak out with the rhymes I write
,But it seems drowned in the 9 to 5
,Below the surface with little time to shine
,It could repulse me deep into the rising tide
,If I had my chance
,Would I risk it all
,Would I dare to leave everything behind me
,If I had the door
,Would I have the will
,Would I have the strength to be on the other side

,A moment
,A story
,A lifetime
,All in side me
,It's 2014 and my future's a dream
,No longer compared to a late magazine
,Feeling creative and painting a scene
,Making love and not wages to please
,Stages are sweet I don't feel the pressure
,Wondering whether I could have done better
,Everyone's measured on their unique treasures
,Here we are lifted by moments of leisure
,I float on my letters and land on a record
,Spin round and soak up the music:my chest roars
,My heart singing,yes I am bessed more
,Here the world feels close like its next door
,What do I rest for?The days,they speed past
,Lying hear wishing I could leap back
,From my sleep to reality and be that
,Superhero that all of my dreams trapped
,If I had my chance
,Would I risk it all
,Would I dare to leave everything behind me
,If I had the door
,Would I have the will
,Would I have the strength to be on the other side

,It was awkward at that Nas concert
,Guys crowded round you like hounds do
,So you threw your arms around my collar
,The freshest necklace
,I felt like a baller
,And I reciprocated  inundated
,with this feeling so right
,Such a beautiful night  I'll never
,forget the conversations we had
,The one time I didn't mind
,staying out of my lab
,Cause we harmonized with
,the music we made
,You talked about your past
,and how you're afraid
,The hurts that he caused and
,how you escaped
,I confessed my mess you
,expressed how you relate
,Should I  give you space to
,explore options
,Or play the love game and
,let you come stalking
,I'm just joshing  kinda sort of

,
,Could be wrong but I think
,When you take center stage not a single eye blinks
,Some forced to squint
,In an awkward attempt
,To somehow filter your glow
,But you know...
,That the polish of your armor got'em in a trance
,Colors intertwine with the power of a dance
,Poetry in motion got'em in a stand still
,Eyes glaze over, jaws drop like anvils
,A feeling you're wishing that even time can't kill
,Sorry to inform you but it can and will
,So make the most of it
,And folks love it
,Is it the bare essentials
,Or the bells and whistles
,Can't tell initially but what remains
,When a fella's history is it the name
,That fades like memories
,Time will tell
,You know that the divine's design prevails
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,We're running out of time and it's funny I guess
,'Cause we strive to make something that it is truly timeless
,That'll never tarnish
,And maintain it's beauty
,But is that the nature of time?
,They say that we got 15 minutes to shine
,But it's all relative
,'Cause 15 minutes can feel like forever if
,We don't believe that time flies
,But you that most are blind to The Inner Minds Eye
,Where people come and go with a blink
,And celebrate your memory and toast with a drink
,Making your exit as their next thought enters
,You've made your deposit in their memory bank
,Hoping one day eventually to gain interest
,Instead of drawing blanks whenever your name's mentioned
,Hot today tomorrow you're cold & lonely
,Tell me where will these songs be...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you

,Will you be long forgotten by the people you know (know)
,When you've lost your glow (glow)
,No one at the show (show)
,And your record stop spinning and you're feeling real low (low)

,Where will the entourage go?
,What will you do if eternal bonds are not so?
,How many women stayed when the money got low?
,When the fans seen it all, will they scream bravo
,Or have a moment of silence, minus the reflection
,Will your records be a valued part of their collection
,In a frame on the wall or end up in a dollar bin
,Will you be forgotten or honored...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy

,of noise,white or grey,every color and shine
,got me going a little crazy in the piece of my mind
,i just want peace of mind,a few moments of time
,to call mine,to find rest,the rejuvenating kind
,maybe i just got to say "no"
,for a moment,let me break it down and move slow
,i know that in all things life will bring

,I would ask God did you craft her? Cause the heartbeats what I'm after
,I could feel love in this chapter could she see herself with a rapper?
,But I'm so much more than a rapper I'm a protector and a poet
,My heart strings are devoted each show but I close it
,Each note by the beat tone is a veto that I see no repo of what He wrote
,Resold but I revoke cause patience is a virtue
,and you're well worth any waiting - so when a painting is enticing
,Im reminded that the icing is inviting
,but the diamond lives below what is shining
,And timing is beyond me - the outer shell could be blinding
,The insides what I'm into your dream thoughts and your passion
,What motivates you to live Is that consistent within your actions
,If it is - then its beautiful a pure heart with consistence
,Motivated by chances to realign our own existence
,In a minute, I could finish the bright lights could diminish
,My positions an extension of where I'm currently headed
,
,Until the season comes to let me know, I'll wait here, I'll wait here
,Until the Lord has made our way to go I'll wait here
,and in His love I'll grow
,This lone road is a hard one the false hope and the stardom
,The bars cope with my lonesome the lights Test my devotion
,The right check and the notion that bright rocks that are frozen
,Define life for some rappers but I'm after higher promotions
,Like life changed by the rhythm music inside of my system
,When im thinking about our future I reflect upon the decisions
,To pray for you and wait - In hopes that I'll see the day
,That smile across your face and the ways that we'll fly to space
,With our matching space suits, a bit of blue and a touch of grey
,A dash of pink for you - how I'm feeling is hard to say
,But I haven't met you yet and if I did I'm not aware
,I've been working on our future crafting at my career
,So when the day comes when I meet you I can speak with your father
,Communicate that I'm able to love and care for his daughter
,Until then I can offer soul beats and a letter
,Painted inside my music - just wait til we see each other
,
,Until the season comes to let me know, I'll wait here, I'll wait here
,Until the Lord has made our way to go I'll wait here
,and in His love I'll grow
,Love is a real decision, more than a general feeling
,Accepting the flaws that's present taking the time to listen
,Seeing they worst condition argumentation visits
,When it does you take a pause - take a look from their perspective
,Taking the journey slowly embracing at every corner
,Enjoy the subtle encounters - taking the time to learn her
,Making her feel protected like her knight in shining armor
,Cause a man like that is rare - in our current time & culture
,Shaking the worldly standards cause to me its all irrelevance
,Try to teach me lust is love - but I speak with more benevolence
,In the present, I just teach with these words and a beat
,In the meantime when I speak - I will rewind what it means
,To be focused and devoted on my life calling im opened
,On a plane ride or the ocean, near the bright lights or below it
,When its show time or before it backstage or performing
,Outside I don't show it - but I can't wait for the moment
,
,Until the season comes to let me know, I'll wait here, I'll wait here
,Until the Lord has made our way to go I'll wait here
,and in His love I'll grow

,I wouldn’t be shocked if it’s still in the ignition,
,I’m tryna change clothes, wash my car till it glistens,
,Then take a spin, bass boomin’ on my system,
,Today the suns shining, borderline blinding,
,What better timing, like planets are aligning
,I’ve waited super long, like a future mom,
,Burning from the burden and now its super gone,
,My new life is born man, no longer torn and
,take off my hood, ‘cause I’ve weathered the storm land
,doin’ 80 (mph) on the expressway
,roll down the windows, sing it out like I’m MJ and say!
,Da dalala dalalalaaaa (repeat)
,I’ve been waiting for this moment
,For this day to arrive
,Though they said it wont be easy, no
,I swam upstream to survive
,money AIN’T comin’ faster, no
,but my friends will make it right, call them up and
,I’mma take my cash and,

,You gotta stop looking at me this way
,Like you'll somehow find the right thing to say
,You know we could sit here
,I could sit here forever
,Just waiting to find the right answer
,We gotta do the right thing
,It sure sounds so easy
,Till I know what that is
,I just tell myself that he needs me
,And that there's no one else in this world
,That loves me like he does
,But reality catches up with us
,I can't be with you
,You can't be with me
,Cuz love is not enough
,This love is not enough
,We have cried a thousand times before
,I can't be with you
,You can't be with me
,Cuz love is not enough
,This love is not enough
,We have tried a thousand times before
,Somewhere in my heart I do believe that we had a chance
,We were somewhere else doing something else
,On different pages drawing sketches of a life
,Guess I turned to the left or you turned to the right
,And we're on different sides now (yes we are)
,Livin' different lives now
,You feel so far away next to me
,So very far away yet you're next to me
,If it feels so far away
,We're all there has to be
,Oh as far away as it seems to be
,Can you stay here when we part
,Can I just stay here when we part
,I'll be still, won't make a sound,
,Quietly won't move anything around
,One last day, can you hold me when you say --
,I can't be with you
,You can't be with me
,Cuz love is not enough
,This love is not enough
,We have cried a thousand times before
,I can't be with you
,You can't be with me
,Cuz love is not enough
,This love is not enough
,We have tried a thousand times before
,Maybe in a little while, in a few years
,We'll look back at this
,Maybe we'll smile, maybe we'll cry
,But I do hope, that I'll be holding your hand
,And that we're still together

,Need you to take the lead
,So I can see the light thats guiding me
,Through my darkest times, I need that light to shine
,When I can't see a ray of hope, will you be my fire fly?
,Tip toein through the unknown, ain't really cuttin' it
,I'm sittin' on the wall, need a breakthrough like it's cuttin' edge
,I heard when all the grey clouds clear the sky happiness resides 'cos it's brighter on the other side
,I seen shadows of doubt tryna consume me
,I felt the heat and the pressure like a jacuzzi
,I stayed on top, rose above it like hot air, I found my shine again
,Noticed the shadows were not there!
,I saw the sun shine through, I saw the skies turn blue
,I grabbed ahold of my dreams, followed there every move
,They re-ignited da spark to shine a light
,So now I keep a candle by my bed to guide my dreams at night
,Shine a light for my people all around the world
,From the ghetto to Japan
,Let the stars see your hands
,Yeah…
,For my people all around the world
,From the hood to the islands
,Keep on rising
,Take it to the highest
,(Shine a light)
,Shine a light on me, even if its moderately
,Let's keep it steady, keep it flowin like its supposed to be
,Highlight the way for the others to come thru
,Show them the way they can "try", "do it" & "don't do"
,All I needed was a light on me for a second, that opened up my eyes and got me circulating questions
,Is there more to me being here then just existin
,Or to spread my light and to get my people listenin
,Fact or fiction, my lifes had it's share of friction
,How I dealt with it, was to get it out my system
,To get wat was heavy on my heart, off my chest
,Ain't never done me wrong, aint found no better yet
,So I relay my light just like the olympic flame
,With hope that other people too will run wid it one day
,And spread the light themselves somethin like a morning rise
,And bare witness to the shine through sleepy eyes
,
,Shine a light for my people all around the world
,From the ghetto to Japan
,Let the stars see your hands
,Yeah…
,For my people all around the world
,From the hood to the islands
,Keep on rising
,Take it to the highest
,Shine a light on me in all of its entirity
,It's time to merge the spotlights and house lights entirely
,lets get together as 1, and shine as a collective
,Raise dem hands to da sky just get perspective
,Of whos with me, who aint, who on the wall
,Can't have no "I might be" man, it's either or
,So join all the pieces of the puzzle, get the picture
,You can take what was learnt and pass it like a scripture
,From N Z to Japan, we came to bridge gaps
,So shine a light on da Nesians over Goon Trax
,And you too can see what is seen amongst the stars
,We give that shine back, no matter who ya are
,Yeah.. No matter who ya are..

,Can you take me the looking glass
,Let me turn my vision from all the things past
,Noetic my nature poetic is my folly
,Aesthetics of my sutures symbolic of my calling
,My perception of every fine line
,Is affected expression the artist in mind
,And I'm in time but your vision transcends
,Yet still you involve your will in my ends
,I admit that only a small part I see
,A small fish tryinto envision the whole sea
,And I want to be a visionary bringer of the light
,But many times I feel like
,I'm blind preaching a sight
,That I don't have
,Theres a portion of me lackin
,Telling me to seek a darkness to go back in
,But you reassure me to take heart
,For your light is the catalyst in my mind the spark
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,I am but a product of my nature
,
,Sinking deeper into all my crimes
,
,And many times I wonder if the maker
,
,Has made me with the right design in mind
,
,And I try to explain it all away
,The rhythm of the rains or where their winds sway
,But I find it all futile a figment of my fears
,It all futile a figment of my tears
,Then the sun sets in the night there I see
,The moon shining in the black canvas for me
,So I choose to believe in the message of the sky
,The rising of the son is my only true guide
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony

,You are the personification of all God's blessings
,Coming to me in just one physical being
,One physical dream that I wanna redeem
,You're Voluptuous
,Sweet caramel brown honeydew
,Satin skin smooth to the touch, what a niggah do
,So sensual
,Her smile like a chemical extract of perfection
,Rare mineral
,She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
,Quiet time love sleep in I wake early
,Honey brown wit the long black hair
,Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
,Slight touch and you taking me there
,So fine and it just ain't fair
,So beautiful and so damn rare
,
,She's angelic and energetic
,Using sex as a weapon
,I reckon that I'm confessing
,Her body is just a blessing from God Down to earth
,She needs to be in a church to prove
,We didn't spawn from fish but God's work
,Hurts to see her clothed cause her body beholds
,Secrets untold valued like platinum and gold
,For she is the key to open my mind to see
,The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly bliss
,I reminisce over touch and kiss
,While you fucking a bitch I go make love to my miss
,Never scandalous
,It unanimous that the how i handled it
,Lights off and candle lit rooms and glamorous
,Yo I call you love sexual you look edible
,Parallel snuggle up close intellectual
,In a rendezvous who are you in wrap hairdo
,No makeup in jean shorts open toe shoe
,I wanna hold you mold ya soul I behold you

,So sweet she may be edible
,She needs a pedestal To step out of heaven you ready boo
,Never hypothetical you factual and magical
,Fuck theatrical
,Baby girl because you actual
,Physically your chemistry is so mathematical
,Had to use academics to define your spirit
,You lifting my limits
,Your name off my tongue is a lyric
,She's a compilation of my minds representation
,Of a representative
,Representing an excellent revelation of time and dedication
,Never impatient
,She know the deal
,Herself to me
,So I can see Her heavenly ways
,Her heavenly gaze
,And plus it don't hurt that she has an ass for days
,So as we lay I reminisce on the day that we met
,Please god never let me forget
,
,I never knew that I'd be here with you
,For as long as I have
,Standing strong on the path
,Where potential and hard work lead to success
,So the longer I last
,Mean the more that I'm blessed
,But through all the test
,I was haunted by doubt
,Sometimes it's like the grim reaper is calling me out
,So you may not fully grasp how truly weird this is
,When my troubled past had so many near misses
,I knew that I could talk but I never knew you listened
,Or that even in the darkest of nights you could glisten
,I never realized
,That I touched real lives
,Nodding to a universal beat and feel vibes
,That give life meaning and unite like minds
,Had no idea that your struggle's like mine
,
,Never knew all I could do with tight rhymes
,I can't believe this
,I never knew that I'd see this
,Or that I had the strength to achieve this
,But on the other hand
,I never knew I'd pick up the pieces
,When they didn't live to see this
,I really miss my fan
,I never knew I carry the weight
,From my birth to my burial date
,And though I never knew
,I'm getting through Keep on
,
,I never knew when I was at the crib bumping my favorites
,That one day I'd be including in somebody's playlist
,Only right I take this opportunity to show love
,To you people listening in places I don't know of
,But see I didn't grow up in the best of situations
,For thinking out the box you sort of get a reputation
,Of living in a dream world with loft expectations
,But I refuse to live by another's limitations
,I never knew for sure
,I'd make it in the door
,But where I'm at now leaves room for plenty more
,Moves to be made one day at a time
,And paths to be paved way after I've rhymed
,For the very last time
,And retired my mic
,And truly focus on my fan who require insight
,And guidance with undying alliance
,But I never knew I'd be in the position that I'm in
,I can't believe this
,I never knew that I'd see this
,Or that I had the strength to achieve this
,But on the other hand
,I never knew I'd pick up the pieces
,When they didn't live to see this

 In the beginning, I remember that God made man
 Crafted in his image, with his own hands
 Then out of mans rib, came the woman
 The creatures we love, like or don't understand
 But it's amazing, I see God's beauty through her physical
 Design plus her mind combined defines miracle
 And I'm not convinced that a mineral
 Or bang from the sky can derive such individuals
 And as the world turns, I wonder with concern
 The time we'll meet and complete each other words
 I'm kidding, but who says fantasies forbidden
 See I'm the type of cat, that express myself from within
 Driven, to promote love in every essence
 Living by this mission it's hard to miss the blessings
 Caressing the mic like a newlywed wife
 Ink flows from my pen in hopes to truly shed light
 Upon this situation that I'm faced with
 One that takes patience to build on foundation
 That we both share now that's stimulation
 Anything less don't impress know what I'm sayin?
 I look into the mirror and everyday it gets clear
 I gotta steer from the places I've veered
 I said I look into the mirror and everyday it gets clear
 I gotta steer...
 
 ,
 Cause I've been lookin for love lookin for love ya'll
 In all the wrong places.
 Lookin for love lookin for love ya'll
 In all the wrong places.
 
 ,
 And in the summer, heat waves rise from the street pave
 Warm nights mixed drinks dope djs
 Females super fly, showing mad thigh
 Thoughts of lust rush guys don't ask why
 Is it her presence or feminine vibe?
 When her body rebels against a vertical line?
 That got guys lying for personal time
 And once they get their catch, they back on the grind
 And I'm just kicking my feet up like Bruce Lee
 Reclined, when this dime approaches within few feet
 Style, not unique, but def got the beauty
 So who cares when this cutie now pursues me
 And with charm I'm on her arm like Coachbag
 One of the few effortless things life threw back
 Then like annoyed smokers we found no match
 And fell apart, without knowing romance
 But what I found, proved to be more special
 A lesson from experience, a jewel for the mental
 Shining from my notepad with rhymes signed in pencil
 Outlining my finding using life as a stencil
 And for this I feel mad fortunate
 For real I'm done with that short term fix
 And I ask can I be fortunate?
 To know that I'm done with this
 
 ,
 Cause I've been looking for love looking for love ya'll
 In all the wrong places.
 Looking for love looking for love ya'll
 In all the wrong places.
 
 ,
 And now I ponder, about the times that we might have
 Caressing questions that sing from my mic stand
 Like damn what's these feelings I'm revealing
 Like if I'd tell tha fellas I'd get smacked in my melon
 But it's unique love only women can provide
 I seent it in my moms, I seent it in her eyes
 I seent it in these guys when proposing to their brides
 Down on bended knee with diamonds shining near her thighs
 It makes me visualize, the way that we'd get down
 I'd take the lead, and no doubt you'd wear the crown
 The one I'd serve, cause she feels my vibe
 Supports my wings, till the day that we fly
 And I know that right now, that we'd grow despite how
 The world is on our shoulders trying to control our lifestyles
 We won't get wiped out, if on the right route
 Soon we'll reunite and then I'll recite out...
 Since the beginning of man our separation is fact
 I said you came from mans rib now I'm taking it back
 I said you came from mans rib and now I'm taking it back
 I said you came from mans rib so join me as...
 We find love, we'll find love girl in all the wrong places...

,Once again, now where do I start, dear love
,Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
,Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night
,Sometimes still pondering the previous plight
,Seems life done changed long time no speak
,Nowadays I often forget the day of the week Taking it by stride if you know what I mean
,No harm done, no offense taken by me
,So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps? Perhaps we're even closer now after all things considered on this side of the planet
,Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it
,To come clean and candid if I have to
,Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
,Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting
,Even better than the real thing
,It's like the God in me saw the devil in you
,I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
,Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth
,Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
,Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
,Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works
,Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds
,C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E evidently, see every song has a sequel
,Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
,C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
,Never same, you got to keep it tight, always just like back then, now hear me out
,Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
,I pray that you keep watching over us,
,From the heavens where light is the nucleus
,To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
,Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather, feel when I leave this shell eventually
,Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally
,Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
,Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
,Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
,From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love
,Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
,Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am, a man full of s-i-n
,It's like the devil in me saw the God in you,
,You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm
,Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
,That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
,I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
,Science plus Arts multiplied Faith then divided by the number of our ethnic race
,Let me mention what I've been thinking
,How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
,So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans
,Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns
,Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man
,Understand the time has finally come to realise the great power of one
,All formulas equalise under the Sun, amen
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe
,Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe
,All good souls lost may they rest in peace
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe
,Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
,The rhymes will heal 'cause I believe in music
,In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
,The beat plus the melody's the recipe
,Hip-hop world wide we got to live in peace like that.

,I know you know we know
,That everything will happen in time
,I know we know you know
,That everything's going to be fine
,I know you know we know
,That everything will happen in time
,It was may 10th when I saw the spiritual light
,Age 10 given a mic driven for life
,But these bills look camouflage unseen like Santa Claus
,Late fee again vicious cycle no handlebars and I'm still riding
,A $100 on an outfit I'm still styling
,My mack game was flawed man out of alignment
,I stood in my lane now these dame's want their own diamonds
,I'm in a place higher than Machu Picchu
,Girls who never chilled now they grill like Yakiniku
,
,It's nice to meet you again for the second time
,Yo I got to run so I'll leave you with this special rhyme
,I know we know you know

,That everything will happen in time
,I know we know you know
,That everything's going to be fine
,I know you know we know
,That everything will happen in time
,Don't sweat the little stuff
,Stick your middle fingers up
,Throw all that useless baggage out like a litter bug
,Focus in on the long road ahead of you
,Smoke a bong load and exhale the residue
,
,I'm never blue because somebody always has it worse
,Keep it moving and get your mama that Prada purse
,What doesn't kill you it just makes you a stronger person
,It's my adversities that helps me write betters
,You can't force it or try to take a shortcut
,Can't buy designer shoes without rocking torn chucks
,
,We all fail we all hurt we all fall
,But we rise again and toast to the last call
,I know we know you know

,That everything's going to be fine

,Go together like treble and bass
,
,Music’s meaning is more than the words, it’s the feeling
,The passion, the soul, writing late in the evenings
,It breathes in the records like turn to the ceiling
,Motivated dreaming, back to what believing
,It’s been in hearts, on tracks in vain
,It’s seen in awe on graff on trains
,The media try to attack its name
,But the realness can’t be attached to fame
,But who am I to say what hip-hop is?
,Hip-hop was before Paradox lived
,Before Yo! MTV Raps got big
,When the soul and the words was what made hop hits
,DJs rock kicks after digging in the crates
,Now we’re living in an age where the rhythm is misplaced
,It’s all about the chains, the millions you make
,So I sit back, imagine as I listen to the greats
,
,Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
,It’s real hip-hop
,Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
,What’s it worth?

,It’s real hip-hop
,Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
,Some say it’s still the same, it ain’t that
,
,It’s the authentic, all the time prolific, lyrical extraordinaire
,Got rhymes to share, to educate the masses
,Toasting the realness, raise your glasses
,Never underestimate the movement
,Always keeping my ear to the pavement
,That’s what the pioneers did back then
,Before they had two 12s making the blend
,No emails to send, only word of mouth
,Seems that real hip-hop is in a drought
,Critics kept saying that it wouldn’t last
,Through the years it persevered and made cash
,Somehow it grew up too fast
,Matured incorrectly, evidently
,Now it’s time to do my thing
,With ill flows and vibes that I bring no doubt

,KRS was number one
,
,Just being in here
,Is a humbling experience to me
,Because you’re looking through all these records
,And it’s sort of like a big pile of broken dreams in a way
,Almost none of these artists still have a
,A career, really
,Ten years down the line you’ll be in here
,So keep that in mind when you start thinking like
,“Oh yeah, I’m invincible and I’m the
,I’m the world’s best or whatever
,Because that’s what all these cats thought
,
,Yeah 我知道这听起来有点老土
,但不管是谁 DJ Joe都得离开
,已经有一段时间没有这样的感觉
,经历了许多 眼前是崭新的东西
,就像皎洁的月光打在身上
,当你一无所有
,要相互坦诚 世间万物皆是如此
,Eh 现在没什么麻烦了 告诉我你还在我身边
,我闭上眼睛数到三
,一 二 三 四
,数尽星星 连接
,三 二 一 告别
,从阴郁的思绪中飞走吧
,时间用来回忆美好
,糟糕的是 这不会给我带来幸福
,我不值得所有这一切
,所以 像这样 让我给你写一首歌
,宝贝 让我感受你如海一般的吻
,Oh 为我停留吧 哪怕是梦境
,靠近点儿 留下来
,给你我的全部
,我想这就是为什么他们 称之为印第安夏
,你能否予我一个微笑或吻 哪怕它不真实
,与你相关的 在我脑海里挥之不去 我也知道我还有许多要做的事
,只是我无能为力 就像夏日微风 所以 让我
,带给你真实的东西 不再忧伤
,即使我有点像傻瓜 但我还是很爱你
,我梦想着有一天
,你卧在我膝盖上 听我诉说这一切
,我的朋友们 他们会见证
,但我知道我是对的
,我沉浸过去
,这并不能让我幸福 我 不值得拥有这些
,我想这就是为什么他们 称之为印第安夏
,宝贝 让我感受你如海一般的吻
,Oh 为我停留吧 哪怕是梦境
,靠近点儿 留下来
,给你我的全部

,It's sad, so sad
,Why can't we talk it over?
,Oh it seems to me  sorry seems to be your hardest word
,It's sad, so sad
,It's a sad, sad situation.
,And it's getting more and more absurd.
,It's sad, so sad
,That sorry seems to be the hardest word.
,Why can't we talk it over?
,Oh it seems to me
,What I got to do to make you love me?
,What I got to do to be heard?
,What do I do when lightning strikes me?
,What have I got to do?
,What have I got to do?
,When sorry seems to be the hardest word.

,I see trees of green red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,
,The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,
,I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do
,
,They're really saying I love you
,
,I hear babies cry I watch them grow
,
,They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
,
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
,I feel so unsure
,As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
,As the music dies, something in your eyes
,Calls to mind the silver screen
,And all its sad good-byes
,
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you are not a fool
,
,Should've known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste the chance that I've been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,
,Time can never mend
,The careless whispers of a good friend
,To the heart and mind
,Ignorance is kind
,There's no comfort in the truth
,Pain is all you'll find
,
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know your not a fool
,
,Should've known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste this chance that I've been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,
,We could have been so good together
,We could have lived this dance forever
,But no one's gonna dance with me
,Please stay
,
,And I'm never gonna dance again
,
,
,Feels like a fire
,That burns in my heart
,Every single moment that we spend apart
,I need you around
,For every day to start
,I haven't left you alone
,Something about you, staring in your eyes
,Everything I looking for I seem to find
,All this time away
,Is killing me inside
,I need your love in my life
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,We fought in a battle, but nobody won
,Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
,You can't turn away,
,The past is said and done
,I need us to carry on
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,You'll try everything
,You never thought of before
,When you live, when you love,
,When you give, when you run
,You can always give up some more
,Baby nothing means anything
,Unless you're here to share with me
,I can breathe, I can live
,I can die,I can sleep
,Cause you are always there in my dreams
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again

,Stay with me, sway with me
,Other dancers may be on the floor
,Dear, but my eyes will see only you

,When we sway I go weak
,I can hear the sound of violins
,Long before it begins
,Make me thrill as only you know how
,Sway me smooth, sway me now

,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway

Stay with me, sway with me

Dear, but my eyes will see only you

When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

,
,end
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,Fly Me To The Moon
,Let me play among the stars
,Let me see what spring is like
,On Jupiter and Mars
,In other words hold my hand
,In other words baby kiss me
,Fill my heart with song
,Let me sing for ever more

,You make me feel so young

,And every time I see you grin
,I'm such a happy individual
,The moment that you speak
,I want to go and play hide-and-seek
,I want to go and bounce the moon
,Just like a toy balloon
,You and I, are just like a couple of tots
,Running across the meadow
,Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
,You make me feel so young
,You make me feel there are songs to be sung
,Bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung
,And even when I'm old and gray
,I'm gonna feel the way I do today

You keep pouring into one glass
And you're never changing the straw
And now to sing this lovely ballad
Here is, Mama Cass
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say, "Nighty-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone, blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

,Songs Title：i get a kick out of you
,My story is much to sad to be told
,But practically everything leaves me totally cold
,The only exception I know is the case
,When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
,Then I suddenly turn and see
,Your fabulous face
,I get no kick from champagne
,Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
,So tell me why should it be true
,That I get a kick out of you
,Some like the perfume from spain
,Im sure that if I took even one sniff
,It would bore me terrifically too
,But I get a kick out of you
,I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
,I get a kick though its clear to see, you obviously do not adore me
,
,I get no kick in a plane
,Flying too high with some gal in the sky
,Is my idea of nothing to do
,But I get a kick out of you
,
,
,
,Welcome to my world,
,Won't you come on in
,Miracles, I guess
,Still happen now and then
,Step into my heart
,Leave your cares behind
,Welcome to my world
,Built with you in mind
,Knock and the door will be open
,Seek and you will find
,Ask and you'll be given
,The key to this world of mine
,I'll be waiting there
,With my arms unfurled
,Waiting just for you
,Welcome to my world
,Waiting just for you
,Welcome to my world

,To brighten up the night, i have you love

Dont know why theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
Keeps rainin all the time
Life is bare, gloom and misry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just cant get my poorself together,
Im weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin chair will get me.
All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Cant go on, evry thing I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
Keeps rainin all the time

ざわめく ざわめく
街を抜けだして 風のうたを!
ひとりになれない その場所からでは
聴こえないの 聴こえないの
この空が泣く日は 雲乗って
ひらいた傘 ほらさ
あじさいに なっていく
隠してくれるから・・・are you OK?
信じたものが そう
音立て消えていく・・・なんてこと!
この世じゃ案外 よくあるハナシよ
絶望しないで
そのきみの頬に ひとすじ
キラリ ひかれば
クラリ くるしいの
触れてみたいけど・・・what do you feel?
真っ赤なウソも 蒼い想い出も
小瓶に詰めて 流してしまおう
消せない色も 塗りかえることならば
きみも ぼくにも できるはず!
そのきみの頬を 濡らした
泪は 心洗い流していく
傷跡に kiss for you
やがて そこにも咲くでしょう
ひらいた心 花を咲かせていく
春が来たなら もう・・・are you OK?

,The Faintest sign (Ft. Kathy Sledge)
,Watching the silver moonlight.
,It's streaming into the window.
,Watching the falter the curtain.
,Moving so gently in the breeze.
,Hearing the constant anything.
,The white noise of the TV set.
,Watching the lights of the buildings.
,A flashing red in the midnight sky.
,Fall in this room of mine.
,Sitting so still I'm hardly breathing.
,I'm just waiting for the thing to sign of you.
,You will return to me someday.
,That's what I'm trying to tell myself.
,Alone the sit on the sofa.
,You know without you I'd feel so cold.
,But in this room of mine.
,Sitting so still I'm hardly breathing.
,Yet another sleepless night on hit of me.
,I'm somewhere in the distance.
,I hear the sound of laughing.
,The photograph on the white wall.
,It's bringing back me the peace,so sweet.
,Oh in this room of mine.
,Sitting so still I'm hardly breathing.
,I'm just waiting for the thing to sign of you.
,Oh Fall in this room of mine.
,Seems I'v forgotten how to sleep.
,I'm just listening and waiting here for you.
,Oh in this room of mine.
,The shining moon my only light.
,So I'm waiting just for you every night.
,Oh in this room of mine.
,Seems I'v forgotten how to sleep.
,So I'm listening and I'm waiting here for you.

,I've got a restless heart,and a wandering way
,I never know how far I'll go or how long I'll stay
,They say I never know what dangers are down each road I roam
,I say I'm better off believing the feelings in my soul
,
,A woman has got her own way
,This woman has got her own
,I'll know that it's right when the ache goes away
,Down in these woman bones
,
,Many a love I've known,but not a one was to be
,I never let them own the gypsy spirit in me
,Life needs freedom to flourish into the beauty it should be
,There's no reason the very same truth could not apply to me

,A woman has got her own way
,This woman has got her own
,I'll know that it's right when the ache goes away

,Oh what a blessed life I've been shown
,One that is mine and mine alone
,This lonely and lovely journey is bliss...ohhhh

,And I greet her with my best kiss
,But now I'm outdone

,Now I can't be alone
,And I can't let her stay

,What's jazz
,Originating in America
,An African and European mix
,But then all this is known to everyone
,No fun to hear all that you know
,What's jazz
,You know of Count Basie, John Coltrane
,Louis Armstrong and all those names
,You know they made the different styles we hear
,The Swing, Be-bop and Dixieland
,But is "Jazz" a style
,Or just the rhythm played
,And will it still be jazz
,Without the improvising style
,Is it an American thing
,A culture old and boring
,Does it have to be done the way that they've played
,Cause isn't jazz supposed to be fun and free
,You know
,I haven't studied to sing at school
,I don't know about all the chords they use
,The music theory that they play is too
,Confusing for my simple mind
,You see
,Ella, Billie and Anita taught me all I know
,That's how I sing my jazz
,"That's not jazz"
,Or "It's a privilege"
,We've heard them many times
,But don't you see it's not logic
,Miles Davis is great to hear
,But try a different ear
,4 Hero, Jazzanova, Matthew Herbert
,Cause otherwise you're saying
,That "Jazz" is dead
,One thing
,Let me explain I do love the old
,But I'm living in the present "now"
,To me the music "jazz" is our spirit
,Like Blues and Soul and also Rock
,That's jazz
,That's why I sing as I sing today
,And I'll be singing all I feel "That's Jazz"
,I think of your face
,
,And my mind slips into outer space
,
,People run around acting like fools
,
,I'm in another place
,
,There must be a way
,
,Will I never find the words to say
,
,If I get the lines that you will hear
,
,Are you gonna disbelieve me dear
,
,I don't wanna lose your love
,
,Darling you are all that I'm thinking of
,
,Let me say the words that you long to hear
,
,My dear
,
,Love don't you agree
,
,Is it something you refuse to see
,
,Let me say the words that you will hear
,
,I only wanna hold you dear
,
,I don't wanna lose your love
,
,Darling you are all that I'm thinking of
,
,Let me say the words that you long to hear
,Are you gonna disbelieve me dear
,
,I don't wanna lose your love

,
,I was trapped under concrete
,Built from the memory
,Of all the daydreams
,That I buried underneath
,Now find me a way to divide
,All of the noise on the other side
,We'll change where we live in the fall
,Soon it will feel like nothing is wrong
,And I could see who I should be
,Through a past that casts it shadow down over me
,In empty fields on summer nights
,I feel the flashing lights
,
,Teeth clenched in moonlight
,A limitation, want to ignite
,Reset my biology
,The imitation, the apology
,And I felt just like a child
,I'm taking it all from the other side
,Driving with you in your car
,The home that I know seems so far
,
,Spring, fall I've lost it all
,Your empty street where we would meet
,Spring, fall The morning fog
,Your empty street where we would meet
,These parking lots bless us with peace
,Your light has strayed, there's no release
,
,Spring, fall I've lost it all
,Your empty street where we would meet
,These parking lots bless us with peace

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor.
,That’s not my business.
,I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone.
,I should like to help everyone if possible-
,Jew, Gentile, black men, white…
,We all want to help one another.
,Human beings are like that.
,We want to live by each others’ happiness,
,not by each other’s misery.
,In this world there is room for everyone.
,And the good earth is rich
,and can provide for everyone.
,The way of life can be free and beautiful,
,but we have lost the way.
,
,Greed has poisoned men’s souls;
,has barricaded the world with hate;
,has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
,We have developed speed,
,but we have shut ourselves in.
,Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
,Our knowledge has made us cynical;
,our cleverness, hard and unkind.
,
,We think too much and feel too little.
,More than machinery ,we need humanity.
,More than cleverness,
,we need kindness and gentleness.
,
,Without these qualities,
,life will be violent and all will be lost.
,
,The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
,The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man;
,cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all.
,Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world,
,
,Greed has poisoned men’s souls
,
,Soldiers!
,Don’t give yourselves to brutes,
,men who despise you and enslave you;
,who regiment your lives, tell you what to do,
,what to think and what to feel! Who drill you,
,diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!
,Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men-machine men
,with machine minds and machine hearts!
,
,You are not machines! You are not cattle!
,You are men! You have a love of humanity in your hearts!
,You don’t hate!
,
,Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural.
,Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!
,
,In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it’s written
,“the kingdom of God is within man”,
,not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!
,In you! You, the people, have the power,
,the power to create machines,
,the power to create happiness!
,You, the people,
,have the power to make this life free and beautiful,
,to make this life a wonderful adventure.
,Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power.
,Let us all unite.

,White walls around these broken flowers colored blueish
,Sofa, chairs, bed, and pillow is on black and white
,Took away the light lights and change it to the dim one
,No pink no green and yellow, cause it’s on dark
,Black clothes are all lying in this room
,Cover the presence of sadness
,You’re like the dim lights, warm but cold
,You’re like the dim lights, each time i see i’ll capture
,When you smile, those dim lights i see will never return
,Water on box is on blue
,Fish inside is breathing but all alone
,Windows outside shows the sun that’s about to go down
,Sudden rain and grey sky goes through me
,Black clothes are all lying in this room
,Cover the presence of sadness

,The morning leads me over to my window.
,The air feels sharp against my skin.
,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in
,I wonder as I listen to the wind blow.
,People walk past in the streets.
,A city that I will never meet.
,People in their cars and their cars in the streets,
,the streets in the city where I sleep.
,Walk down to the supermarket.
,Milk and bread in my basket.
,Chocolate on the shelf and my mind on the docket,
,I'm a slave to the change that's in my pocket.
,Planes draw lines in the skies.
,Beautiful people fill my eyes.
,Drawing lines now to my own conclusions,
,beauty is desire in disguise.
,The morning leads me over to my window.
,The air feels sharp against my skin.
,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in
,I wonder as I listen to the wind blow.

Moon River, wider than a mile: 
I'm crossin' you in style someday. 
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker, 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin'your way. 
Two drifters, off to see the world. 
There's such a lot of world to see.

My romance, doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitar

Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
All at once I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
And wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you, but you

,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way

, You're such a lovely audience
, We'd like to take you home with us
, We'd love to take you home
,
, I don't really want to stop the show
, But I thought that you might like to know
, That the singer's going to sing a song
, And he wants you all to sing along
, So let me introduce to you
, The one and only Billy Shears
, And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
,
,Drive My Car (Lennon/McCartney)
,
,Asked a girl what she wanted to be
,She said baby, can't you see
,I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
,But you can do something in between
,
,Baby you can drive my car
,Yes I'm gonna be a star
,Baby you can drive my car
,And baby I love you
,
,I told a girl that my prospects were good
,And she said baby, it's understood
,Working for peanuts is all very fine
,But I can show you a better time
,
,Baby you can drive my car
,Yes I'm gonna be a star
,Baby you can drive my car
,And baby I love you
,
,Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
,
,Baby you can drive my car
,Yes I'm gonna be a star
,Baby you can drive my car
,And baby I love you
,
,I told a girl I can start right away
,And she said listen babe I got something to say
,I got no car and it's breaking my heart
,But I've found a driver and that's a start
,
,Baby you can drive my car
,Yes I'm gonna be a star

,
,
,
,And now the end is near
,So I face the final curtain
,My friend, I'll say it clear
,I'll state my case of which I'm certain
,
,I've lived a life that's full
,I've traveled each and every highway
,And more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Regrets, I've had a few
,But then again, too few to mention
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exception
,I planned each charted course
,Each careful step along the byway
,Oh, and more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
,When I bit off more than I could chew
,But through it all when there was doubt
,
,I ate it up and spit it out
,I faced it all and I stood tall
,And did it my way
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried
,I've had my fails, my share of losing
,And now as tears subside
,I find it all so amusing
,Just to think I did all that
,
,And may I say, not in a shy way
,Oh, no, no not me
,I did it my way
,For what is a man, what has he got
,If not himself, then he has not
,To say the all the things be truly feels
,And not the words he would reveal
,The record shows I took the blows
,but i did it my way
,
,
,
,
,You know that it would be untrue
,You know that I would be a liar
,If I was to say to you 
,Come on baby, light my fire 
,Come on baby, light my fire
,Try to set the night on fire 
,The time to hesitate is through
,No time to wallow in the mire 

,And our love become a funeral pyre
,Come on baby, light my fire
,Come on baby, light my fire

,It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
,It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
,
,February 5th, Friday morning, purple dawn
,Broke a yawn, as a I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
,A moment like a poem, you wish you could hold it
,I shut my eyes like it's frozen, it's gone when I open
,It slipped passed the clouds right there where it lingered
,Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
,My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
,ON a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning
,If only I could touch past the phony
,If only they were there now to hold me
,As the questions keep droning
,
,You're the only one who stuck it out last night
,The only other one who caught the other line
,You're the only one when this world collides
,The one that I can't deny
,
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are
,In an unreliable world you shine like a star
,It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
,It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
,
,It's my last year here
,My first class moved to portable 'a'
,Under construction since summer
,And it's cold today
,I can see my breath, and what's left of the west parking lot
,And all the spaces that we fought
,And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
,In past piles of rubble, in puddles of rain water
,That hurt last night when I left like that
,When I won't come back
,Speaking my peace to the past
,I can't help but wonder, who is this wind at my back
,A whisper to walk on, come on from all that
,You're the only one who stuck it out last night
,The only other one who caught the other line
,You're the only one when this world collides
,The one that I can't deny
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are
,In an unreliable world you shine like a star
,It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
,It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
,
,How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind
,You found me on a summer breeze
,How am I gonna run away when the autom breaks
,Now that you found me in the spring
,Come on and sing it out
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are
,In an unreliable world you shine like a star
,It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
,It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are

There are roads
That can take you to places
That you've never been
There are people
When you meet them
It's like they have lived
Inside your skin
There are souls
You connect with so strong
A bond that is so deep
And so true
That's the way
I feel about you
There are times
Like a magnet
You are drawn
Into somebody's life
You don't know
What you're doing
Are why you are there
But, you know it's right
There's a sense
That the piece that was missing
Has suddenly come into view
That's the way
I feel about you
I believe in this world
There is nothing
That happens by chance
There's a reason
That I just as would take you
The moment you came
Into my hands like a gift
That you're never expecting
But you treasure
Your whole life through
That's the way
I feel about you
There's a sense
That the piece that was missing
Has suddenly come into view
That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
I feel about you

,Maroon 5
,Valentine's Day OST
,
,Some day, when I'm awfully low,
,When the world is cold,
,I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
,And the way you look tonight.
,
,Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
,And your cheeks so soft,
,There is nothing for me but to love you,
,And the way you look tonight.
,
,With each word your tenderness grows,
,Tearing my fear apart...
,And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
,It touches my foolish heart.
,
,Lovely ... Never, ever change.
,Keep that breathless charm.
,Won't you please arrange it ?
,'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.
,
,
,And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
,It touches my foolish heart.

,I never maybe my sugar
,That sugar baby of mine
,He's special ration
,Funny, he never asks for my money
,All I give him is honey
,And that he can spend anytime
,I'd make a million trips to lips
,It I were a bee
,Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me
,He's confectionary
,Sugar, I never cheat on my Sugar
,Cause I'm too sweet on my Sugar
,That sugar baby of mine
,Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
,Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
,You say why did you do it with him today?
,And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
,Cause you\'re my fella, my guy
,Hand me your stella and fly
,By the time I\'m out the door
,You tear me down like roger moore
,I cheated myself
,Like I knew I would
,I told ya, I was troubled
,You know that I\'m no good
,Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy,
,He\'s in the place, but I cant get joy,
,Thinking of you in the final throws, this is when my buzzer goes
,Run out to meet your chicks and bitter
,You say when we\'re married cause youre not bitter
,There\'ll be none of him no more
,I cried for you on the kitchen floor
,I cheated myself
,Like I knew I would
,I told ya, I was troubled
,You know that I\'m no good
,Sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
,Were like how we were again
,I\'m in the tub youre on the seat
,Lick your lips as I soak my feet
,Then you notice lickle carpet burn
,My stomach drops and my guts churn
,You shrug and it\'s the worst
,To truly stuck the knife in first
,I cheated myself like I knew I would
,I told ya I was troubled, you know that I\'m no good
,I cheated myself, like I knew I would
,I told ya I was troubled, yeah ya know that I\'m no good

,To wash our cares away
,Into the blue like a balloon
,Feeling free and flying high
,It was like you
,and I might float forever
,Never say good bye

,Where do you start?
,How do you separate the present from the past?
,How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last?
,That didn't last
,With bits of memories scattered here and there
,I look around and don't know where to start
,Which books are yours?
,Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
,Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine
,That intertwine
,So many habits that we'll have to break
,And yesterday's we'll have to take apart
,One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
,To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
,A moment in what might have been
,Where do you start?
,Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
,Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye?
,I guess you try
,And though I don't know where and don't know when
,I'll find myself in love again
,I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
,A tiny part deep in my heart, that stays in love with you
, 作曲 : Wonder

,With looks to blow Picasso's mind
,You were the best
,Your body moved with grace and song
,Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms

,Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
,Where did it go
,Just why that you would overnight
,Turn love to stone as cold as ice

,Narrow daylight
,Entered my room
,Shining hours were brief
,Winter is over
,Summer is near
,Are we stronger than we believe?
,I walked through halls of reputation
,Among the infamous too
,As the camera clings to the common thread
,Beyond all vanity
,Into a gaze to shoot you through
,Is the kindness we count upon
,Hidden in everyone?
,I stepped out in a sunlit grove
,Although deep down I wished it would rain
,Washing away all the sadness and tears
,That will never fall so heavily again
,Is the kindness we count upon
,Is hidden in everyone
,I stood there in the salt spray air
,Felt wind sweeping over my face
,I ran up through the rocks to the old wooden cross
,It's a place where I can find some peace
,Narrow daylight
,Entered my room
,Shining hours were brief
,Winter is over
,Summer is near
,Are we stronger than we believe?

,That my life would change forever
,Saw you standing there
,I didn't know I cared
,There was something special in the air

,The only kind of real fantasy
,Illusions are a common thing
,I try to live in dreams
,It seems as it's meant to be
,Dreams are my reality
,A different kind of reality
,I dream of loving in the night
,Although it's only fantasy
,And loving seems alright
,If you do exist honey don't resist
,Show me a new way of loving
,Tell me that is true show me what to do
,I feel shomething special about you
,Dreams are my reality
,The only kind of reality
,May be must fool is ness has past
,And may be now at last
,I'll see how a real thing can be
,Dreams are my reality
,A wonderous world where I like to be
,I dream of holing you all night and holing you seem try

,Turned cartwheels cross the floor
,I was feeling kind of seasick
,The crowd called out for more
,The room was humming harder
,As the ceiling flew away
,When we called outfor another drink
,But the waiter brought a tray
,and so it was later
,As the miller told his tale
,That her face at first just ghostly
,Turned a whiter shade of pale
,
,You said there is no reason
,And the truth is plain to see
,But I wander through my playing cards
,And would not let it be
,I'm one of the sixteen virgins
,Who are leaving for the coast
,And although my eyes were open
,They might just as well been closed
,and so it was later
,As the miller told his tale
,That her face at first just ghostly
,Turned a whiter shade of pale

,Ooo, In your wild eyes
,I can feel the night
,Ooo, in your wild eyes

,Ooo, in your wild eyes
,In your wild eyes
,It's the way you love
,And the rules you make
,You amplify my desire to escape
,I need the highs you think you know
,Places where I'd never dare to go
,In the dark they go like stars,
,bright, light
,In the night I see them glow
,Wild eyes
,I can see bright light

Besame besame mucho
Cette chanson d'autrefois je la chante pour toi
Besame besame mucho
Comme une histoire d'amour qui ne finirait pas
On la chantée dans les rues
sur des ciels inconnus et dans toute la France
On la croyait oubliée
et pour mieux nous aimer voilà qu'elle recommence
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi.
On ne demande à l'amour
ni serment de toujours ni décor fantastique
Pour nous aimer il nous
simplement quelque mots qui vont sur la musique
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi

, 
I want you the right way 
I want you, but I want you to want me too 
Want you to want me baby 
Just like I want you 
Da da, da da, da da da 
I'll give you all the love I want in return 
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling 
It's too bad, it's just too sad 
You don't want me no more 
But I'm gonna change your mind 
Some way, somehow 
, 
Da da, da da, da da da 
One way love is just a fantasy 
To share is precious, pure and fair 
Don't play with something you should cherish for life 
Oh baby, don't you wanna care? 
Ain't it lonely out there? 
, 
I want you the right way 
I want you, but I want you to want me too 
Want me baby, just like I want you 
Da da, da da, da da da

Chris Brown - Open Road (I Love Her)


I should’ve been a better man
Instead of wasting time spending my life
Searching for the finer things, Woaaah
You always gave me another chance to make it right
But I didn’t deserve, cause I didn’t understand

And I feel so bad
Cause you wouldn’t do the same to me
But I know what your weakness is, is, is
And you feel so mad
And now you’re on an open road so gone not looking back, back, back

I thought I had you on a leash
Like I could do whatever I wanted to when I wanted to
And you was gonna wait for me baby
Nooo, and now the tables have turned
And now I feel like you’re the master and I’m on the strings
You’re in control of me

And I feel so bad
Now you’re doing it to me cause you know what my weakness is, is, is
And you feel so mad
And now I’m on an open road tryna go but I’m looking back, back, back

I’m looking for her
I’m tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

I’m looking for her
I’m tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

You can blame it all on me
I know it’s like this because of me
Now I’m just like a hitchhiker waiting for a ride
with no cars in sight

And it feels so bad
Cause you wouldn’t do the same to me
Cause I know what your weakness is
And I feel so mad
Now you’re on an open road, long gone I can’t have you back, back, back

I’m looking for her
I’m tryna find her
I really need her
I think I love her

I wanna see her
I dont ever wanna leave you
I wanna keep ya
I think I love her

Hey, girl! You wanna try something new
Girl, I’m hopin’ you do.
Cuz baby we can fly around the world
and the friendly skies are blue.
Might get a little crazy, might get rough,
might get bumpy going up.
In the air, but that’s love, take the dare, don’t be scared, Nooo

I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down.
I’m mile high
feeling weightless off the ground.
There’s something about this altitude
that kinda gets me in the mood.
I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down.

Hey, I don’t even care what they say
cuz I like it this way.
getting nice comfortable That U ll see
and  I can make U be free.
Might get a little crazy, might get rough
might get bumpy going up.
In the air, I’m your man, feel so good everywhere, yeahhh….

I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down. Noo…
I’m mile high
feeling weightless off the ground.
There’s something about this altitude
that kinda gets me in the mood.
I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down.

I will fulfill your fantasies.
Think of the possibilities.
Don’t appreciate view above the clouds.
We’re leaving gravity below.

I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down
I’m mile high
feeling weightless off the ground.
There’s something about the altitude
that kinda gets me in the mood.
I’m mile high
never coming down.
I’m mile high
and I’m never coming down, Noo…
I’m mile high
feeling weightless off the ground.
There’s something about this altitude
that kinda gets me in the mood.
I’m mile high
never coming
Never coming down, Noo…

Elisha La'verne - Postcards

It's been a week since you left
I feel like I lost my head
I never thought I will be hopeless
Don't know what to do with myself
Tried everything but it's been hell
Not having you around
I am tired of sleeping
I am tired of eating
Cause I can't enjoy it on my own
I am tired of waiting and anticipating
Only end up here alone

I know you are thinking of me too
Display by all these postcards postcards
Nothing I can hold on to and I
It ain't right cause all compared to you
When I am holding these postcards postcards

When I am holding these postcards postcards

Should see my eyes when I wipe
The .. into me
I swear I hear your voice so clearly
But when I put .. down it's like I never heard a sound
And it's playing with my heart
Cause I am tired of acting
I know that reacting
I am not apt to play this role
I am tired of wishing for something that's missing
Only end up here alone

Sometimes I wanna throw them away
Cause it just get in the way
Lately feels complicated getting me aggravate it
By the times I hold them close they're the only thing I know
How much time I .. to get these postcards
And I compared postcards postcards

Guantanamera, Guajira Guantanamera
Guantanamera, Guajira Guantanamera
Yo soy un hombre sincero
De donde crecen las palmas.
Yo soy un hombre sincero
De donde crecen las palmas.
Y antes de morir me quiero
echar mis versos del alma. 
Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera, 
Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera. 
Mi verso es de un verde claro
Y de un carmín encendido.
Mi verso es de un verde claro
Y de un carmín encendido.
Mi verso es un ciervo herido
Que busca en el monte amparo. 
The words mean "I am a truthful man from the land of the palm trees. 
And before dying, I want to share these poems of my soul. 
My poems are soft green. My poems are also flaming crimson. 
My poems are like a wounded fawn seeking refuge in the forest. 
The last verse says:'Con los pobres de la tierra'. With the poor people of this earth I want to share my fate. The streams of the mountains please me more than the sea."

Por los pobres de la tierra
Quiero yo mi suerte echar
Por los pobres de la tierra
Quiero yo mi suerte echar
Y el arroyo de la sierra
Me complace más que el mar
Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera, 
Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera.
Yo viTantas noches tantos dias
Tantas vidas tan vacias
Yo viTantos barcos tanto mar
Senti, el calor de las 
AntillasEl olor de nuestras islas
La paz del sol y la arena
Vi lindas mananas
Calles y ventanas
Lagrimas y risas de tristeza y de alegria vi
Crei ser el fin de la aventura
Pero el corazon murmura
Que hay tanto sueno por vivir.
Sopla el primer viento y trae la pena,cabizbaja, aún somnolienta,con el polvo haciendo lazoen su cabeza.
Sopla el primer viento y trae la penade una ingrata primaveraque cambió su traje blancopor el gris de la tormenta.
Pena, pena que se va y regresa,como lleva y trae la arenauna ola que rabiosa roba huellas.
Pena, pena ajena,que me acechacomo propia, como nueva,como una ave que, cansada de viajar,al fin se queda.
Pena, vuela penaadonde quieras,rómpete contra las piedraso queda, quédate quieta.
Pena, vuela penaadonde quieras,pero lejos de la tierradonde yace moribunda la inocencia
Pena, pena que mata, que quema,
Pena inmensa que envenena,que te empaña el horizonte
Aunque ya, ya no haya niebla.
Pena, pena enorme, pena eterna,que endurece, que lacera,que convierte a la princesaen la más anciana reina.
Pena, pena ajenaque me acechacomo propia, como nueva,como una ave que cansada de viajaral fin se queda
Pena , vuela penaadonde quieras.
Rómpete contra las piedraso queda, quédate quieta.
Pena, vuela penaadonde quieras,pero lejos de la tierradonde acaban de enterrar a la inocencia

,He deals the cards as a meditation
,And those he plays never suspect
,He doesn't play for the money he wins
,He doesn't play for respect
,He deals the cards to find the answer
,The sacred geometery of chance
,The hidden law of a probable outcome
,The numbers lead a dance
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,He may play the jack of diamonds
,He may lay the queen of spades
,He may conseal a king in his hand
,While the memory of it fades
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,But that's not the shape,shape of my heart
,And if i told you that i loved you
,You'd maybe think there's something wrong
,I'm not a man of too many faces
,The mask i wear is one
,Those who speak know nothing
,And find out to their cost
,Like those who curse their luck in too many places
,Are those who fear a lost
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,Thats not the shape,shape of my heart

,All his life he did his best for all
,And the crown of laughter hanging low
,The spotlight in the ring
,The choruses that sing
,The paint and masquerade was just a show
,
,Happiness around
,Just a soul lonely in the crowd
,
,His heart is all alone
,No one wants the tears of a clown
,The living of the glory and applause
,The circus tent, the only home he knows
,The cover-up is bold,
,The mask becoming cold
,It’s easier to let the eyelids close
,Happiness around
,The clown – the clown
,His heart is all alone
,The final curtain falls for all to see
,The final score, the circus melody
,His star that shone so bright,
,Gave comfort in the night
,The light that always held him set him free
,The clown – the clown
,His heart is all alone

,There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town
,Starlight by the edge of the creek
,The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
,Money's gettin' shallow and weak
,Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory
,It's a new path that we trod
,They say low wages are a reality
,If we want to compete abroad
,My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
,Come sit down on my knee
,You are dearer to me than myself
,As you yourself can see
,While I'm listening to the steel rails hum
,Got both eyes tight shut
,Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
,Creeping it's way into my gut
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
,Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
,Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
,Tossed by the winds and the seas
,I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
,I'll sell 'em to their enemies
,I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
,Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
,Sometimes no one wants what we got
,Sometimes you can't give it away
,Now the place is ringed with countless foes
,Some of them may be deaf and dumb
,No man, no woman knows
,The hour that sorrow will come
,In the dark I hear the night birds call
,I can feel a lover's breath
,I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
,Sleep is like a temporary death
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
,Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

,Well, they burned my barn and they stole my horse
,I can't save a dime
,I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
,Into a life of continual crime
,I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
,How I wish you were here to see
,Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
,That you have forgotten me?
,Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
,They waste your nights and days
,Them I will forget
,But you I'll remember always
,Old memories of you to me have clung
,You've wounded me with your words
,Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
,It's all true, everything you've heard
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

,In you, my friend, I find no blame
,Wanna look in my eyes, please do
,No one can ever claim
,That I took up arms against you
,All across the peaceful sacred fields
,They will lay you low
,They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
,I say it so it must be so
,Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
,Gonna give you another chance
,I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
,To lead me off in a cheerful dance
,I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
,I can live on rice and beans
,Some people never worked a day in their life
,Don't know what work even means
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

,I knew a lady who came from Duluth
,She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
,She went to her grave just a little too soon
,And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
,Where do bad folks go when they die
,They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
,They go down to the lake of fire and fry
,Won't see them again till the fourth of July
,Now the people cry and the people moan
,And they look for a dry place to call their home
,And try to find some place to rest their bones
,While the angels and the devils
,Fight to claim them for their own
,Where do bad folks go when they die
,They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
,They go down to the lake of fire and fry
,Won't see them again till the fourth of July

,with a glass of good malt whisky in his hand

,he didn't leave much owing
,when he finally paid the bill

,and he's howling at the moon

,Where do I begin to tell the story
,Of how great a love can be
,The sweet love story that is older than the sea
,The simple truth about the love she brings to me
,Where do I start
,With her first hello
,She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
,There'll never be another love another time
,She came into my life and made the living fine
,She fills my heart
,She fills my heart with very special things
,With angel songs and wild imaginings
,She fill my soul with so much love
,That any where I go i'm never lonely
,With her along who could be lonely
,I reach for her hand
,It's always there
,How long does it last
,Can love be measured by the hours in a day
,I have no answers now but this much I can say
,I know i'll need her until the stars all burn away
,And she'll be there
,She'll be there

, Outside another yellow moon
, Has punched a hole in the nighttime, yes
, I climb through the window and down to the street
, I'm shining like a new dime
, The downtown trains are full with all of those Brooklyn girls
, They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
,
, Well you wave your hand and they scatter like crows
, They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
, They're just thorns without the rose
, Be careful of them in the dark
, Oh, if I was the one you chose to be your only one
, Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now
, Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
,
, Every night it's just the same, you leave me lonely now
,
, I know your window and I know it's late
, I know your stairs and your doorway
, I walk down your street and past your gate
, I stand by the light at the four-way
, You watch them as they fall, oh baby, they all have heart attacks
, They stay at the carnival, but they'll never win you back
,
, Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
, Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby
, Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
, All of my dreams they fall like rain, oh baby on a downtown train
,
, Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
, Where every night, every night it's just the same, oh baby
, Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
, All of my dreams just fall like rain, all on a downtown train

,We don't always have the strength to start
,Keep on downing all the way
,Living hard like a ghost in time
,The crowd left the evening play
,The fake connection to our own people
,Makes some mockery of us
,The south cave we dancing in easeful
,Irony cops on the floor
,It's so hard to carry on
,When we fall in love
,Though our hearts are young
,
,
,
,
,
,we wander among the old stones
,searching for highways and bones
,stealing cigarette packs and wine
,are you the thing they call open road?
,i'm waiting out here so alone
,who ease is trying to sleep
,to the sound of a gypsy black tune?
,turn off the lights and please hide the moon
,i saw an angel,she was the same
,lonely young bone who drowned in the lake one morning
,kiss my thighs and my womb
,while i say you're the only one
,who can save me from death
,and the fate that i have
,give me a proof of your love,
,surrender and drown in my blood
,and come feel the divine
,dark blind passion that blooms
,write me a song,
,i'll rise from my tomb
,tell me your name
,i have no name
,but i'm here to free you from those water chains
,i saw an angel,she was the same
,lonely young bone who drowned in the lake one morning

,I'm Just A Country Boy
,I ain't gonna marry in the fall
,I ain't gonna marry in the spring
,Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl
,who wears a diamond ring
,
,And I'm just a country boy
,money have I none
,But I've got silver in the stars
,and gold in morning sun ,gold in morning sun
,
,Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips
,of the prettiest girl in town
,Never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
,I know she'd turn me down
,Cause I'm just a country boy
,money have I none
,But I've got silver in the stars
,and gold in morning sun ,gold in morning sun
, 邛海听雨
,Never could afford a store bought ring
,with the sparkling diamond stone
,All I could afford is a loving heart the only one I own
,Cause I'm just a country boy
,money have I none
,But I've got silver in the stars
,and gold in morning sun ,gold in morning sun
,start...
,Where is the sun
,where is the day I'm looking for
,Where is the moon
,where are the stars that'd shine before
,Where are you
,where are you
,Where is the time
,when hours were like minutes here before
,Where are the nights
,when it was warm even on the floor
,Where are you
,where are you
,Where are the eyes that looked at me
,with love and nothing more
,Where are the arms that made me feel
,so welcome at the door
,Where are you
,where are you
,start...
,if i could write about the way you make me feel
,i wonder what i’d write
,because of all the words there are to use
,that never say it right
,when i only have a minute and it’d take a thousand hours
,and some new words too
,but my nights are never blue
,and i don’t mind the rain when i’m with you
,when i’m with you the songs are already written
,melodies turn into words nobody’s ever said
,when i’m alone the only thing i can say that’s true
,is my nights are never blue
,and i don’t mind the rain when i’m with you
,so if i could write about the way you make me feel
,i don’t know what i’d write
,because of all the words there are to use
,that never say it right
,when i only have a minute and it’d take a thousand hours
,and all those new words too
,but my nights are never blue

,
,Too many birds in one tree
,Too many birds in one tree
,And the sky is full of black and screaming leaves
,The sky is full of black and screaming
,
,And one more bird
,Then one more bird
,And one last bird
,And another
,
,One last black bird without a place to land
,One last black bird without a place to be
,Turns around in hopes to find the place it last knew rest
,Oh black bird, over black rain burn
,This is not where you last knew rest
,You fly all night to sleep on stone
,The heartless rest that in the morn, we'll be gone
,You fly all night to sleep on stone
,to return to the tree with too many birds
,Too many birds
,Too many birds
,
,If...
,If you...
,If you could...
,If you could only...
,If you could only stop...
,If you could only stop your...
,If you could only stop your heart...
,If you could only stop your heart beat...
,If you could only stop your heart beat for...
,If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart...
,If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart beat.
,
,I started out in search of ordinary things
,How much of a tree bends in the wind
,I started telling the story without knowing the end
,I used to be darker, then I got lighter, then I got dark again
,Something to be seen was passing over and over me
,Well it seemed like the routine case at first
,With the death of the shadow came a lightness of verse
,But the darkest of nights, in truth, still dazzles
,And I wore myself until I'm frazzled
,I ended up in search of ordinary things
,Like how can a wave possibly be?
,I started running, and the concrete turned to sand
,I started running, and things didn't pan out as planned
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,Done me in
,
,
,What are you like?
,You've had a right life
,taken a long ride
,but oh what a cost
,all of your life
,staring at white lines
,Reading the road signs
,and oh what a loss
,
,Sleeping late in the afternoon
,playing your guitar
,Born under a bad sign
,Sleeping late in the afternoon
,staying out till dawn
,Born under a bad sign
,Now you laying in the afterglow
,And there's something that she wants to know
,Are you going be the one to say
,You belong to me
,
,born under a bad sign
,Born under a bad sign
,Everybody knows
,Everybody knows
,Everybody knows
,
,
,Darling, wait for me, by your gate
,In the evening light, ah
,I just can't wait
,For I have to go, in the morning too soon
,So honey don't you cry,
,I'll be back here soon.
,So think of me, when you feel that moon
,Oh it calls to me, as it calls to you
,Darling wait for me,
,I'll be home then
,When the autumn leaves, bring me back again
,Darling wait for me, darling please wait
,Till evening light, by your starlit gate
,So think of me, when you feel that moon
,Oh it calls to me, as it calls to you
,That's all I ask of you,
,all I ask Till
,I hold your hand, there'll be peace at last
,Don't wait up till it's dark,
,All those lonely hours that we're apart
,Darling please
,Darling please
,Darling please
,Darling please.

You should have seen it coming
The signs were everywhere
Maybe you were in denial or you just didn’t care
I been standing in the shadow of the light we use to share
Now my heart is tired of reaching and I’ve grown cold, so cold
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would feel this way
You were the greatest story I ever told
I believed in the life we made the love we gave through the laughter and the rain
But you took my love for granted and I’ve grown cold
Your I’ll do better next time kisses
That brought me right back to you 
Are frozen in the photographs of who I used to be
And time has washed away my sadness
Love has made me brand
And I can finally say that I ‘m over you
I am better now without you 
So much better now
There’s nothing left to say
Got my life back, my swagger
So much better now
So I’ll be on my way
I wish you peace and happiness
I harbor no regrets and all the very best for you to hold
You see don’t want to live with the bitterness of angry ghost
That haunt you form the past
I just need some love and shelter from this cold
Your I’ll do better next time kisses
That had me running right back to you 
Are frozen in the photographs of who I used to be
And time has washed away my sadness
Love has made me brand new
And I can finally say that I ‘m over you
I am better now without you 
So much better now
There’s nothing left to say
Got my life back, my swagger
So much better now
So I’ll be on my way
I am better now without you 
So much better now
There’s nothing left to say
Got my life back, my swagger
So much better now
So I’ll be on my way
I’ll be on my way; I’ll be on my way with a smile on my face
Yeah, Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I gotta go I gotta live I gotta be me yeah oh
Gotta go gotta go now ahhh
I am better now without you 
So much better now
There’s nothing left to say
Got my life back, my swagger
So much better now
So I’ll be on my way

Prettier than all the world and I'm so proud
I'm so proud of you
You're only one fellow's girl and I'm so proud
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud girl
I'm so proud of you
Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes, and I'm so proud
Believe me, I love you too
I'm so proud of being loved by you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah, and I'm so proud
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling, won't you hold me tight?
And never let me go
Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go
Oh, a million times or more
We said we'd never part
But lately I found
That you're a stranger in my heart
Give me the right
In summer or spring time
Let me tell the world that
You are mine and never let me go, go, go, go
Never let me go

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
Little girl again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me your best friend
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you look in my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize
That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, love me
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I must confess, you're not to be blamed
For being caught in those boys vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact
I'm going to stop the blueness in you
Also confess what my heart wants me to
That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, love me
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
Just once more you look in my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize
That I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you, love me
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
...

What do you know about it
Who had told you so
It makes no difference
The whole world can know
I loved and I lost
It happens to the best
So I loved and I lost
And I may as well confess
She was so beautiful
Like flowers full bloom in May
Her kiss was like the roarin wind
It left me speechless with nothing to say
I loved and I lost
The fire would not ignite
So I loved and I lost
And I wish her back with all my might
'Cause she was so very good to me
I loved and I lost, baby
It happens to the best
So I loved and I lost
And I may as well confess
I loved and I lost
I loved and I lost
I loved and I lost

,I think about that day
,I left him at a Greyhound station
,West of Santa Fé
,
,We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
,Still I did what I had to do
,'Cause I just knew
,
,Summer: Sunday nights
,We'd sink into our seats
,Right as they dimmed out all the lights
,A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
,It called me to be on that screen
,And live inside each scene
,
,Without a nickel to my name
,Hopped a bus, here I came
,Could be brave or just insane
,
,We'll have to see
,
,'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
,He'll sit one day, the lights are down
,He'll see my face and think of how he...
,...used to know me
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,I hear 'em ev'ry day
,The rhythms in the canyons
,That'll never fade away
,The ballads in the barrooms
,Left by those who came before
,They say "you gotta want it more"
,So I bang on ev'ry door
,
,And even when the answer's "no"
,Or when my money's running low
,The dusty mic and neon glow
,Are all I need
,
,And someday as I sing my song
,A small-town kid'll come along
,
,That'll be the thing to push him on and go go
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,And when they let you down
,The morning rolls around
,
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Just another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Another day has just begun
,It's another day of sun

,Bengawan Solo
,River of love,behold
,Where the palms are swaying low
,And lovers get so enthralled
,Bengawan Solo
,River of love we know
,Where my heart was set aglow
,When we loved not long ago
,Chorus:
,Nightingales softly singing
,The guitar is gently playing
,Moon and stars brightly shining
,Shining for you and I
,In that moment divine
,You whispered you were mine
,And you vowed we ’d never part
,Down by the river of love
,Chorus:
,Nightingales softly singing
,The guitar is gently playing
,Moon and stars brightly shining
,Shining for you and I
,In that moment divine
,You whispered you were mine
,And you vowed we ’d never part
,Down by the river of love
,And then there was you
,And then there was you my dear
,I thought love was a game one would win or would lose
,Until I found you
,Until I found you my dear
,I thought love was a shame so I threw it away
,And then there was you
,I thought I was right
,But now it seems I was wrong
,I just waited so long and I feared love had gone
,And then there was you
no time to waste
but make you pace
it’s OK to remove copy and paste
I’m doing my way
you do it your way
don’t just follow your left find the right way
stereotypes
too many hypes
but I’m the epitome of new types
having the fear is power to my soul
cuz I overcome them
that’s how I roll
expose your thoughts
don’t be afraid of making mistakes
rules prevailing in
(some things that you cannot run away)
that may be your greatest rival
believe in faith and your heart
your true soul stop being
(you must face yourself sooner of later)
in the shades come on
out in the open sun
Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are rich with density of love
thorny path
there’s no easy way for real bliss
so I keep fighting for
beauty of destiny
stand up and fight for your delight
lose sometimes but a cry is worth a dime to shine
(no one wins it all no oh)
don’t let one loss shut your lights down
extra coated with nice, hot syrup
my sweet flows make my life stirred up
I like to keep this fire so flared up
reasons I gotta fight but cheer up
taste of fear is taste of life
take for granted then you might taste the nightmares
be careful not to get impaired
have faith in what you do here and there
this age went from local to global to glocal
so called lifestyle evolved
beauty of change in time I revolve around it
this era I’m so involved
a lot nonsense did provoke me to write
and it got me so deep, changed my life
still struggling but keep the fist tight
mostly against me, my life
times you win times you lose
times you smile times you frown
times,
every moment’s add’n’multiple of life
(each sec counts, they mount to something)
at times you vision
times you’re blinded
times you listen
times you can’t hear what your heart really says
(you need to focus, don’t be fooled, by it)
in flow of city
Just Let go of yourself
Free your mindset
times you win
times you lose
but at times you gotta bring the king’s ring
so follow the flow of century like twitter
prepare for the moment then be a heavy hitter
my voice is heard now even when I whisper
but I had to earn it the right to glitter
Mr. L to the J keeping it Mr. swagger right
Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are rich with density of love
thorny path
there’s no easy way for real bliss
so I keep on fighting for
beauty of destiny
Beauty of the child of destiny
delightful days
are rich with density of love
thorny path
there’s no easy way for real bliss
so I keep on fighting for
beauty of destiny
gonna keep on fighting for beauty of destiny

Oh, he's got a fine brown frame
I wonder what could be his name
He looks good to me and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame
How long have you been around
Mister, when did you hit this big town
I wanna scream 'cause I've never seen
Such a fine brown frame
All that I have is a broken down chair
But I would gladly make him king on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here
Together we would really be gone
Woh, ooh, he's got a fine brown frame
I wonder what could be his name
He is solid with me and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame
Be be be be beep
He's got such a fine brown frame
I wonder what could be his name

But I would gladly make him king on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here
Together we would really be gone
Ooh, he's such a fine brown frame
Honey, won't you tell me your name
He is solid with me and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame
Now Robert Taylor, Robert Young, Ameche and Gable
Are all as fine as mountain sable
You may not be classed with the elite
And you may not be hip to that jive-like foot, an' all greet
Oh, woh woh woh, baby, you, you look
Like Hercules done up in bronze
And I know I'm a clown whenever you're around
Because I'm crazy 'bout, mad about, wild about
Your fine brown frame

I don't want French fried potatoes,
Red ripe tomatoes,
I'm never satisfied. 
I want the frim fram sauce with the Ausen fay
With chafafa on the side.
I don't want pork chops and bacon, 
That won't awaken
My appetite inside.
I want the frim fram sauce with the Ausen fay
With chafafa on the side.
Now a persons really got to eat
And a person should eat right.
Five will get you ten
I'm gonna feed myself right tonight.
I don't want fish cakes and rye bread,
You heard what I said.
Waiter, please serve mine fried
I want the frim fram sauce with the Ausen fay

 No one can ever reprise

 Never met it face to face
 I never new my heart could sing
 Never missed a warm embrace
 
 Till April in Paris, whom can I run to?
 What have you done to my heart?

 I never new my heart could sing
 Never missed a warm embrace
 
 Till April in Paris, whom can I run to?
 What have you done to my?
 
 One more time
 
 April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
 April in Paris
 
 Just one more time
 
 April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
 April in Paris 

Well, he's my guy, 
I don't care what he does'
Cause he's my guy, 
I guess he always was
He's careless about me, sometimes 
I don't think he tries
But once in a while he'll hug me and smile
Then I can see me in his eyes
Oh, he's my guy, 
I know, he'll always be
And I will try to keep that guy loving me
However he wants me, 
I'm his until 
I dieFor nobody knows, better than 
IThat he's, yeah, he's my guy
He's my guy, 
I know he'll always be
And I will try, try to keep him loving me
However if he wants me, 
I might be his until 
I die'Cause nobody knows, better than 
IThat he's and he'll always be my guy
  Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
 Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
 Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim
 
 Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
 I never seem to set his love afire
 Gone are the years I've wasted on him
 ,
 Sometimes when I get feelin' low
 I say let's call it quits
 Then I hang on and let him go Breakin' my heart in bits
 
 Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me
 But even if he does you can believe me
 I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim
 
 I'll go on lovin' my Jim 

作词 : Hudson, Mills
  You're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me,
 I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony!
 I thought that you never would doubt me,
 But I'm tellin' you you'd be much better off without me!
 
 You're just the kind of a boy who would always play fair,
 I'm just the kind of a girl who would never be square;
 It's so hard to let you go,
 But it's only because I know
 That you're not the kind of a boy for a girl like me.

 That you're not the kind of a boy,

 Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
 Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
 Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me
 You and you alone, bring out the Gypsy in me
 I love all the many charms about you
 Above all, I want these arms about you
 Don't be a naughty baby
 Come to mama, come to mama do
 My sweet embraceable you
 I love all the many charms about you
 Above all, I want my arms about you
 So don't you be, a naughty baby
 Come to papa do
 My sweet embraceable you

 Don't be a naughty baby, come to mama, do

In this world of ordinary people, extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures, of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you
I live to love, 
I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new 
I'll muddle through with you to guide me
In this world where very many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever 
I'm glad there is you
I live to love, 
I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new 
I'll muddle through with you to guide me
In this world where very many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever 
I'm glad there is you
  Oh, its a long, long while
 
 from May to December,
 
 But the days grow short
 when you reach September.
 
 
 
 When the autumn weather
 
 turns the leaves to flame
 
 one hasn't got time
 
 for the waiting game.
 
 
 
 Oh the days dwindle down
 
 to a precious few
 
 September
 
 November
 
 
 
 And these few precious days
 
 I'll spend with you.
 
 These precious days
 
 I'll spend with you.

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

,Bossa Curve - Runaways
,
,Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
,A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
,I've been on a trail for a little while
,But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
,Teenage rush, she said, ain't we all just runaways?
,We got time , but that ain't much
,
,We can't wait till tomorrow
,You gotta know that this is real baby
,Why you wanna fight it
,It's the one thing you can choose
,Oh!
,We got engaged on a Friday night
,I swore on the head of our unborn child
,That I could take care of the three of us
,But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
,It's in my blood
,She said she might just run away somewhere else
,Some place good
,We can't wait till tomorrow
,You gotta know that this is real baby
,Why you wanna fight it
,It's the one thing you can choose
,Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose
,Ain't we all just runaways?
,I knew it when I met you
,I'm not gonna let you  run away
,I knew it when I held you  I wasn't letting go
,We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
,Hold each other 'til the morning light
,We used to laugh, now we only fight
,Baby are you lonesome now?
,At night I come home after they go to sleep
,Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
,There's a picture of us on our wedding day
,I recognize the groom but I can't settle in these walls
,We can't wait till tomorrow
,Now we're caught up in the appeal,
,Baby why you wanna hide it?
,It's the last thing on my mind
,（you wanna hide ）
,I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
,Ain't we all just runaways?
,I knew it when I met you

,Do you remember the 21st night of September?
,Love was changing the minds of pretenders
,While chasing the clouds away
,Our hearts were ringing
,In the key that our souls were singing.
,As we danced in the night,
,Remember how the stars stole the night away
,Aaahh Ba de ya - say do you remember
,Ba de ya - dancing in September
,Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
,My thoughts are with you
,Holding hands with your heart to see you
,Only blue talk and love,
,Remember how we knew love was here to stay
,Now December found the love that we shared in September.
,Only blue talk and love,
,Remember the true love we share todayyy yeah
,Aaahhh Ba de ya - say do you remember
,Ba de ya - dancing in September
,Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
,There wasn’t Ba de ya - say do you remember

,お早うございます。
,今日はラーメンを作ります。
,楽しみですね。
,じゃ、始めましょう。
,Yo, I still masturbate while eating top ramen
,At a faster rate in the bigger quantities
,It counts as rape when I'm slurping at this unbelievable pace
,I turn the temperature up all the way to sweat up on my face
,If you give no effort, if you got no money
,Then I got a cheap method
,Crack it open throw it in a pan and let it cook bitch
,Now that's a real education fuck books
,If you wanna make it in college acknowledge
,All the flavors that be dropping
,Mad knowledge on these pussy ass canned goods
,We got chicken and beef to boost the manhood
,Anybody want a piece of me will have to get this ramen first
,Start with the shrimp and then the fire
,If you're fully blazed then this shit'll get you higher
,Thirty-five cents a pack, three for a dollar
,Unbelievable pricing that's the future of a blue collar worker
,And I'm talkin' bout ramen
,This shit'll fill you up when you're feeling like an African
,Come back when you're in the state that I'm in
,And say hi to my homeboy top ramen
,
,When you gave me back the key
,that's when I realized it's over
,I wanna keep everything in frames
,Will you keep on loving me?
,though I'll move on love someone else
,Hateful thought,dictating my mind
,
,The reason why we're in
,(in this quiet empty room)
,is tangled,it's not pretty
,(Words can never catch up on this)
,Our past,present,and our future
,could never win being greedy
,Unselfish love found no place in me
,Hurting you hurts me more
,Loving you has to stop
,How could I ever start to forget you?
,You will never know
,why I have to leave you
,why I can't open up my heart
,why I choose this life over you
,Let it rain on me,
,so that you won't see my tears
,trust me baby it's not for your love
,"I will never lie"
,So just keep believing me
,So that I'll forever be
,so called clean and pure in your heart
,It's time to say bye to your love
,One foot in,that was enough
,doors behind me were compeletly shut
,I could not look at your eyes straight
,Two words left for me to say
,"Good-bye"
,The longgest,the biggeset,the heaviest meaning hiding behind it
,
,What I've been looking for
,was not this kind for sure
,but life moves on without my confirm
,You will never know
,why I have to leave you
,why I can't open up my heart
,why I choose this life over you
,Let it rain on me,
,so that you won't see my tears
,trust me baby it's not for your love
,"I will never lie"
,So just keep believing me
,So that I'll forever be
,so called clean and pure in your heart
,It's time to say bye to your love

,Gonna make it up to you soon
,I know you're angry baby
,I'm gonna make it up to you
,Gonna make it up to you soon
,Cause I won't dance for anyone
,But I would dance for you
,And I wouldn't sing for anything
,But I would sing for you
,And I wouldn't lie for anyone
,But I would lie for you
,Tell me where to lie
,Tell me what to say
,Tell me what to do, for you
,And you can break my bones
,You're the song I sing between clenched teeth
,And I go do do do do... for you
,yeah I go do do do do... for you
,I won't dance for anyone
,But I would dance for you
,And I wouldn't kill for anyone
,But I would kill for you
,And I wouldn't die for anyone
,But I would die for you
,Cause it's a dangerous thing, to be loved by cam
,And these are the words of Amber Lynn
,So now you tell me you want me to be your queen
,But will you cut my head off if I get too mean

,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis

,Belle, is the only word I know that suits her well
,When she dances oh, the stories she can tell
,A free bird trying out her wings to fly away
,And when I see her move I see the hell to pay
,She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come
,And it's no use to pray these prayers to Notre Dame
,Tell, who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone?
,I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone
,Oh Lucifer, please let me go beyond God's law
,And run my fingers through her hair Esmeralda
,
,Belle, there is a demon inside her who came from hell
,And he turned my eyes from God, and oh, I fell
,He put this heat inside me I'm ashamed to tell
,Without my God inside I'm just a burning shell
,The sin of Eve she has in her I know so well
,For want of her I know I'd give my soul to sell
,Belle, this Gypsy girl is there a soul beneath her skin?
,And does she bear the cross of all our human sin?
,Oh Notre-Dame, please let me go beyond God's law
,Open the door of love inside Esmeralda
,Belle, even though her eyes seem to lead us to hell
,She may be more pure more pure than the words can tell
,But when she dances feelings come no man can quell
,Beneath her rainbow coloured dress there burns the well
,My promised one please let me one time be untrue
,Before in front of God and man I marry you
,Who would be the man who'd turn from her to save his soul?
,To be with her I'd let the devil take me whole
,Oh, Fleur-De-Lys, I am a man who knows no love
,I go to open up the rose Esmeralda
,She dances naked in my soul and sleep won't come
,And it's no use to pray these prayers to Notre Dame
,Tell, who'd be the first to raise his hand and throw a stone?
,I'd hang him high and laugh to see him die alone
,Oh Lucifer, please let me go beyond God's law
,And run my fingers through her hair Esmeralda

Sento la terra piangere sotto l'asfalto nero
La madre lo guardava gli diceva non è vero
I fiori dal fiorista li han tagliati, stan piangendo
Mamma per davvero, per davvero io li sento
Non dire queste cose quando sei in mezzo alla gente
La madre preoccupata lo guardava seriamente
Figlio c'è qualcosa in te che mi spaventa tanto
Sono preoccupata io non so se ce la faccio
Quanto dispiacere nel suo cuore può tenere
Senza mai farlo vedere
Ma il figlio può sentire
Anche se lei non lo dice, anche se sembra felice
C'era una ragazza con un vestito a festa
C'era una ragazza, studiava in una stalla
Mangiava la polenta e il latte
C'era una donna con un vestito nero
C'era una donna, era molto ambiziosa
Ed aspettava un figlio ancora
Mamma tu mi fai aver paura della gente
Se anche Mariolino è la gente io con chi parlo?
Forse stai sbagliando a dirmi di starmene zitto
Al supermercato c'è la frutta che sta urlando
L'acqua dentro i tubi sta piangendo, io la sento
Mamma se ti tieni sempre tutto quanto dentro
Forse è per questo che lei sta bevendo tanto
Quello che io sento io vorrei provare a dirlo
Al massimo che vuoi qualcuno mi riderà in faccia
Cosa vuoi mai che importi, ma che cosa vuoi che importi
La madre a un certo punto lei ha perso il controllo
Non so dov'è andata, non l'ho mai accarezzata
Quanto dispiacere nel suo cuore può tenere
Senza mai farlo vedere
Ma il figlio può sentire
Anche se lei non lo dice, anche se sembra felice
C'era una ragazza con un vestito a festa
C'era una ragazza, studiava in una stalla
Mangiava la polenta e il latte
C'era una donna con un vestito nero
C'era una donna, era molto ambiziosa
Ed aspettava un figlio ancora
C'era anche un uomo
Con un gran bello sguardo
Quando la guardava, ah lei sentiva caldo
Mi scusi lei saprebbe dirmi...
C'era una bambina, nel cuore una gran festa
C'era una bambina, del mondo una promessa
Del mondo una certezza

,Lady
,On your night the shining harber
,And I love you
,You have made me what I am
,And I am yours
,My love,there's so many ways
,I want to say I love you
,Let me hold you in my arms forever more
,You have gone and made me such a fool
,I am so lost in your love
,And all we belong together
,Won't you believe in my soul
,Lady
,For so many years I thought
,I'd never find you
,You have come into my life and made me whole
,Forever let me wake to see you
,Each and every morning
,Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear
,In my eyes I see no one else but you
,There's no other love like our love
,And yes,oh yes
,I'll always want you need me
,I've waited for you for so long
,Lady
,Your love is the only love I need
,And beside me is where I want you to be
,'Cause my love, there is something I want you to know
,You're the love of my life
,You're my lady
,
,I started out in search of ordinary things
,How much of a tree bends in the wind
,I started telling the story without knowing the end
,I used to be darker, then I got lighter, then I got dark again
,Something to be seen was passing over and over me
,Well it seemed like the routine case at first
,With the death of the shadow came a lightness of verse
,But the darkest of nights, in truth, still dazzles
,And I wore myself until I'm frazzled
,I ended up in search of ordinary things
,Like how can a wave possibly be?
,I started running, and the concrete turned to sand
,I started running, and things didn't pan out as planned
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,Done me in
,Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
,Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
,Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love
,Oh let me see your beauty
,when the witnesses are gone
,Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
,Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
,Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
,We're both of us beneath our love,
,we're both of us above
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
,Dance me through the curtains
,that our kisses have outworn
,Raise a tent of shelter now,
,though every thread is torn
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
,Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
,Touch me with your naked hand or touch me
,with your glove
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love
,Dance me to the end of love

,I get along without you very well,
,Of course I do,
,Except when soft rains fall
,And drip from leaves, then I recall
,The thrill of being sheltered in you arms,
,Of course I do,
,But I get along without you very well.
,I've forgotten you just like I should,
,Of course I have,
,Except to hear your name or someone's laugh,
,That is the same,
,But I've forgotten you just like I should.
,What a guy, what a fool am I,
,To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
,What's in store, should I phone once more?
,No, it's best that I stick to my tune
,I get along without you very well,
,Of course I do,
,Except perhaps in spring, but I should never think of spring,
,For that would surely break my heart in two
,
,And now, the end is near;
,So I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case,
,of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and evry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the by way,
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill, my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say not in a shy way,
,Oh no, oh no, not me,

, 
Last Christmas 
I gave you my heart 
But the very next day you gave it away 
This year 
To save me from tears 
I'll give it to someone special 
Once bitten and twice shy 
I keep my distance 
But you still catch my eye 
Tell me baby 
Do you recognize me? 
Well 
It's been a year 
It doesn't surprise me 
I wrapped it up and sent it 
With a note saying "I love you" 
I meant it 
Now I know what a fool I've been 
But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again 
, 
A crowded room 
Friends with tired eyes 
I'm hiding from you 
And your soul of ice 
My god I thought you were 
Someone to rely on 
Me? 
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man under cover but you tore me apart 
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again 
, 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
A man under cover buy you tore him apart 
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone 
I'll give it to someone special.

,Yeah, she was swinging by the bangles in a main street store
,A while before we met
,The most dangerous angles that you ever saw
,She spied her amulet
,And she took a loop of leather for around her neck
,And that was then the start
,The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
,She found her golden heart, you found your golden heart
,Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
,To some Arcadian band
,I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
,Just to hold time in my hand
,And you shot me with a cannonball of history
,And long forgotten art
,I'd be turnin' it over as our words ran free
,I'd hold your golden heart and I'd hold your golden heart
,And nothing in the world prepared me for, your heart, your heart
,Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart
,Your golden heart
,Your golden heart
,Your golden heart
,Your golden heart
,Golden heart
,
,And every time I'm thinking of you from a distant shore
,And all the time I sleep
,I will have a reminder that my baby wore
,A part of you to keep
,And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
,And while we are apart
,I will carry the wonder that you gave to me
,I'll wear your golden heart and I'll wear your golden heart
,Oh, nothing in the world prepared me for, your heart, your heart
,Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart

There's a bright golden haze in the meadow
There's a bright golden haze in the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky
Well, oh what a beautiful morning, aw now
Yes, what a wonderful day
(Look out there)
You know I, I've got a beautiful feeling
Everything's, everything's going my way
(Ya'll c'mon now)
Whoa, the cattle are standing like statues
The cattle are standing like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye, she said
Oh, what a beautiful morning, yeah
Well, what a wonderful day, I want ya'll to know, oh now
I've got a beautiful feelin', I got everything, everything's goin' my way
Everything's goin' my way, my way
(Alright ya'll, do it to me)
Oh, alright now, aha
Whoa, the sounds of the earth are like music
The sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is as busy, it don't miss a tree
And a little ol' weepin' willow is laughin' at me, she said
Oh, what a beautiful morning
(Alright now)
Yes, what a wonderful day, alright
Yeah, I got a beautiful feelin', I got everything, I got everything
I got everything

,And now, the end is near;
,So I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case,
,of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and evry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the by way,
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill, my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say not in a shy way,
,Oh no, oh no, not me,
,I did it my way.
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows
,I did it my way

,Yes it was my way

,Feels like a fire
,That burns in my heart
,Every single moment that we spend apart
,I need you around
,For every day to start
,I haven't left you alone
,Something about you, staring in your eyes
,Everything I looking for I seem to find
,All this time away
,Is killing me inside
,I need your love in my life
,I wanna spend time till it ends
,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,We fought in a battle, but nobody won
,Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome

,I wanna fall with you again
,Like we did when we first met
,I wanna fall with you again
,You'll try everything
,You never thought of before
,When you live, when you love,
,When you give, when you run
,You can always give up some more
,Baby nothing means anything
,Unless you're here to share with me
,I can breathe, I can live
,I can die,I can sleep
,Cause you are always there in my dreams

Con su ropa soleada
阳光下的衣裳
,Je voudrais du soleil vert
,Des dentelles et des théières
,Des photos de bord de mer
,Dans mon jardin d\'hiver
,Je voudrais de la lumière
,Comme en Nouvelle Angleterre
,Je veux changer d\'atmosphère
,Dans mon jardin d\'hiver
,Ta robe à fleurs
,Sous la pluie de novembre
,Mes mains qui courent
,Je n\'en peux plus de l\'attendre
,Les années passent
,Qu\'il est loin l\'age tendre
,Nul ne peut nous entendre
,Je voudrais du Fred Astaire
,Revoir un Latécoère
,Je voudrais toujours te plaire
,Dans mon jardin d\'hiver
,Je veux déjeuner par terre
,Comme au long des golfes clairs
,T\'embrasser les yeux ouverts
,Dans mon jardin d\'hiver
,Ta robe à fleurs
,Sous la pluie de novembre
,Mes mains qui courent
,Je n\'en peux plus de l\'attendre
,Les années passent
,Qu\'il est loin l\'age tendre
,Nul ne peut nous entendre

,Spinning, laughing,dancing
,To her favorite song
,A little girl with nothing wrong
,Is all alone
,Eyes wide open
,Always hoping for the sun
,And shell sing her song to anyone
,That comes along
,Fragile as a leaf in autumn
,Just fallin to the ground
,Without a sound
,Crooked little smile on her face
,Tells a tale of grace
,Thats all her own
,Fragile as a leaf in autumn
,Just fallin to the ground
,Without a sound
,Spinning, laughing, dancing
,To her favorite song
,Shes a little girl with nothing wrong
,And shes all alone
,A little girl with nothing wrong
,And shes all alone
,how long does it take to fall in love
,cause i think that there's something wrong
,should it i know by now
,how strong do the feelings that i have to feel
,to know if it's really real
,or are we just faking it
,cause i know
,maybe my heart beats too slow
,maybe this flower just won't grow
,no matter how much we water it
,and i know
,that i've gotta some things that i need to do
,maturity is something that i'm not used to
,how i wish that there was something that i could say to you
,i'm not in love with you girl
,not in love with you
,i'm so sorry i can't give my heart to you
,i've tried many times to talk to you
,to tell you what time i missed you
,and baby we've grown apart
,and i've cried
,many nights lying next to you
,where my heart breaks in two
,i've gotta tell you the truth
,cause i know
,maybe my heart beats too slow
,maybe this flower just won't grow
,no matter how much we water it
,and i know
,that i've gotta some things i need to do
,maturity is something i'm not used to
,i wish there was something that i could say to you
,so baby here i go
,i‘ve said it once before
,this timing is just not right
,it's time to say good night
,the love that now we share
,just burning down
,we bet it's already are gone
,baby i'm so sorry
,not in love with you
,i'm so sorry i
,can't give my heart to you
,but i'm not in love with you girl
,i'm not in love with you boy
,not in love with you
,i'm so sorry i can't give my heart to you
,
,Hardest thing i've ever done is keep believing
,
,There's someone in this crazy world for me
,
,The way that people come and go through temporary lives
,
,My chance could come and i might never know
,
,I used to say no promises let's keep it simple
,
,But freedom only helps you say goodbye
,
,It took a while for me to learn that nothing comes for free
,
,The price i paid is high enough for me
,
,I know i need to be in love
,
,I know i've wasted wait too much time
,
,I know i ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
,
,And fool enough to think that's what i'll find
,
,I know i need to be in love
,
,I know i want to be in love
,
,I know i need to be in love
,
,I know i want to be in love
,
,So here i am with pockets full of good intentions
,
,But none of them will comfort me tonight
,
,I'm wide awake at 4 a m without a friend in sight
,
,I'm hanging on a hope but i'm all right
,
,I know i need to be in love
,
,I know i've wasted wait too much time
,
,I know i ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
,
,And fool enough to think that's what i'll find
,
,I know i need to be in love
,
,I know i've wasted wait too much time
,
,I know i ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
,
,And fool enough to think that's what i'll find
,
,I know i need to be in love

,What is life?
,Life is like a big obstacle
,put in front of your optical to slow you down
,And everytime you think you gotten past it
,it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
,What are friends?
,Friends are people that you think are your friends
,But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
,and disguises, to hide they true colors
,So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
,they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
,What is money?
,Money is what makes a man act funny
,Money is the root of all evil
,Money'll make them same friends come back around

,then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
,I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
,Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
,for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
,I'm tired of using plastic silverware
,Tired of working in Building Square
,Tired of not being a millionaire
,But if I had a million dollars
,I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
,If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
,without a condom on, while I'm on the john
,If I had a million bucks
,it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
,robbing armored trucks
,If I had one wish
,I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
,I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor

,in the back of a Contour
,I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
,Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
,Tired of being stared at
,I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
,Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
,Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
,Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
,saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
,I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
,Tired of J-L-B saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

,I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
,If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick

,You know what I'm saying?
,I'm tired of all of this bullshit
,Telling me to be positive
,How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
,Know what I'm sayin?
,I rap about shit around me, shit I see
,Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything
,Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
,Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
,But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
,Just fed up
,That's my word

,Ya todo el corazn te lo entregu
,Eres mi fe eres mi dios eres mi amor
,I see trees of green, red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
,They're really saying I love you.
,I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more than I'll never know
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
Lyrics：Rogers/Hart Music：Rogers/Hart
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

,
,Back at the start
,It was all hearts and flowers
,Candlelight rendezvous
,That lasted for hours
,But since he's gone
,You toss and turn until dawn
,Nobody ever told you
,It would feel like this when
,Each tender dream
,Just seems to fade like dew does
,Your arms keep reaching
,For the lover man who was
,Faithless and mean
,But now he's gone from the scene
,They oughta write a song about that
,About the way it hurts when you realize
,All those promises were false
,About the lonely sound when the music dies
,Like a broken waltz
,If there were prizes
,For those sighs of regret
,You'd be the envy
,Of the "oh, woe is me" set
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,They oughta write a song about that
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,Oh, they ought to write a song about that
,Somebody somewhere
,Oughta write a song about that
,I see trees of green... red roses too
,I see 'em bloom... for me and you
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
,
,I see skies of blue... clouds of white
,Bright blessed days...dark sacred nights
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
,
,The colors of a rainbow...so pretty ..in the sky
,Are also on the faces...of people ..going by
,I see friends shaking hands...sayin'.. how do you do
,They're really sayin'...i love you.
,
,I hear babies cry... I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more...than I'll never know
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world
,... what a wonderful world
中島美嘉 - YOU'D BE SO NICE TO COME HOME TO
feat.勝手にしやがれ

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love

You'd be so nice to come home to.
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love

,
, How much do I love you?
, I'll tell you no lie
, How deep is the ocean?

, How far would I travel
, To be where you are?
, How far is the journey
, From here to a star?
, And if I ever lost you,
, How much would I cry?

,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seems to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh I'd love to climb to mountain, reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh I'd love to go out fishing in a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
,Now, mama, dance with me
,I want my arms about you
,The charms about you
,Will carry me through
,yes Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Take it Ella, swing it
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Descubrimos vos y yo
En el triste carnaval
Una mÃºsica brutal
MelodÃ&shy;as de dolor
Despertamos vos y yo
Y en el lento divagar
Una mÃºsica brutal
EncendiÃ³ nuestra pasiÃ³n
Dame tu calor
BÃ©bete mi amor

, 作词 : McKennitt
,Loreena McKennitt - Greensleeves
,Alas my love you do me wrong
,To cast me off discourteously;
,And I have loved you oh so long
,Delighting in your company.
,Greensleeves was my delight,
,Greensleeves my heart of gold
,Greensleeves was my heart of joy
,And who but my lady Greensleeves.
,　
,I have been ready at your hand
,To grant whatever thou would'st crave;
,I have waged both life and land
,Your love and goodwill for to have.
,Greensleeves was my heart of gold
,Thy petticoat of sendle white
,With gold embroidered gorgeously;
,Thy petticoat of silk and white
,And these I bought gladly.

Lara Fabian - Tango
Paroles: Lara Fabian
Musique: Rick Allison

Mais qu'est ce que je fous là
Je sombre au fond de toi
Quelle heure est t-il et quel feu me noie
Fait-il noir ou clair, je n'sais pas
Ma peau se colle au rouge de ton sang qui bouge
Et qui coule vers moi
Je danse et je me bats

Et j'enroule mes chevilles autour de toi
Mes jambes se plient
Je contourne tes hanches
Sur mes reins se joue ta revanche
Je prie en vain mais toi tu rie, une soif s'assouvit
Je danse ou je me bats
Je n'sais pas, je n'sais pas
Tango mi amor
Tu me fais mal et mon sort
Est le bien qui me dévore
Quand mon corps se tord
Tango mi amor
Animal ou matador
L'un de nous deux est le plus fort
Quand mon corps se tord

Mais le doute s'installe
Je me sens comme en cavale
La vie me pousse dans la course
Mon corps qui te repousse
Tes gestes me rappellent que tu n'as pas sur moi
Le droit que je te dois, je danse et je me bats
Mais comment dire à qui, à quoi, à qui je suis
Quand de n'appartenir qu'à toi est le défi
Et si je te disais qu'il n'y a pas que toi
Je danse et tu te bats
Je danse et tu te bats
Tango mi amor
Tu me fais mal et mon sort
Est le bien qui me dévore
Quand mon corps se tord
Tango mi amor
Animal ou matador
L'un de nous deux est le plus fort
Tango mi amor

Tango mon corps
Ne t'appartient pas encore
Et si mon ame s'en sort
Mon corps, lui, se tord

FIN
 
Vuelvo al Sur
Como se vuelve siempre al amor
Vuelvo a vos
Con mi deseo, con mi temor
Llevo el Sur
Como un destino del corazon
Soy del Sur
Como los aires del bandoneon
Sueño el Sur
Inmensa luna, cielo al revés
Busco el Sur
El tiempo abierto y su después
Quiero al Sur
Su buena gente, su dignidad
Siento el Sur
Como tu cuerpo en la intimidad
(Merci à Isabelle pour cettes paroles)

People see you coming by
It's a hint of paradise
Side to side your body sways
Round and round the music plays

Olha como vem, menino
Olha como vai, mulato,
Me faz deleitar, menino
Me faz delirar, mulato.

Moving just like a baiana
Olha que chica cubana
Maybe she comes from Havana
She takes me right to Nirvana

Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Avé Maria 
Laia, ladaia, sabatana, Avé Maria

People see you coming by
It's a hint of paradise
Side to side your body sways
Round and round the music plays

Olha como vai
Bueno pa' gozar ,
You and I, we two
alone here in this terrace by the sea,
the sun is going down
and in your eyes
I see the changing colors of the sea...
It's time for you to go,
the day is done
and shadows stretch their arms
to bring the night.
The sun falls in the sea
and down below a window light we see,
just you and me...
You and I, we two
alone in this caffee with dimming lights...
A full and rising moon comes from the sea
And soon the bar will close for you and me,
But there will always be a song to tell
a story you and I cannot dismiss,
the same old simple story of desire,
and suddenly that kiss, that kiss...

Album:Dreamer


Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice
Someone to understand
Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand
And be a team with me
So nice, life would be so nice
If one day I\'d find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me
Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me
Some little samba song
Someone to take my heart
And give his heart to me
Someone who\'s ready to
Give love a start with me
Oh yeah, that would be so nice
Shoulde be you and me
I would see that would be nice

Voce viu só que amor
Nunca vi coisa assim
E passou, nem parou
Mas olhou só pra mim
Se voltar vou atras
Vou pedir, vou falar
Vou dizer que o amor
Foi feitinho pra dar
Olha...
é como o verao
Quente o coracao
Salta de repente
Para ver a menina que vem
Ela vem, sempre tem
Esse jeito no olhar
E vai ver, tem que ter
Nunca tem quem amar
Hoje sim, diz que sim
Ja cansei de esperar
Nem parei, nem dormi
Só pensando em te dar
Peco...
Mas voce nao vem, bem
Deixo entao, falo só
Digo ao céu, mas voce vem

,Tempo em que vou preguntando se gostas de mim.
,Tempo que falar em estrelas,
,Falar de um mar, de um ceu assim,
,Falar do bem que se tem,
,Mais voce nao vem, nao vem.

,Gente se rindo falando, zombando de mim.
,E eu a falar em estrelas,

,So I go on asking if maybe SOME day you\'ll care.
,I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air.

,Two things I know how to do.

,Two is loving you.

,Even though there’s no-one sitting there
,But a chair is not a house
,And a house is not a home
,When there’s no-one there to hold you tight
,And no-one there you can kiss goodnight
,A room is still a room
,Even though there’s nothing there but gloom
,But a room is not a house
,And a house is not a home
,When the two of us are far apart
,And one of us has a broken heart
,Now and then I call your name
,And suddenly your face appears
,But it’s just a crazy game
,When it ends, it ends in tears
,Darling, have a heart
,Don’t let one mistake keep us apart
,I’m not meant to live alone
,Turn this house into a home
,When I climb the stairs
,And turn the key

ねえここからでたいの　誰にも追いつけない程遠くへ
名前のない感情　知りたくもない　消してしまいたい　摘み取られる前に

冴えた月の色に染まる　小さな花
囚われた願いを託す

どうしようもなく救いのないこの世界を生きていくの
だからせめて君のその手を離さない、いいでしょ？
真理なんて関係ないの　目を閉じて祈るだけじゃ嫌だ
弾かれるように求めるだけ

ああ　何かを証明することなんて　途方もなくおもうよ
ねえ　いつしか　明日が来ないように　ただ輪郭に馴染もうとしていた

夜の匂いで満たされる小さな部屋
囚われた君を探す

どうしようもなく終わりのないこの一瞬を生きていくよ
だからせめてそばに居て欲しいよ　ねえ、いいでしょ？
倫理なんて関係ないよ　失ってばかりはもう嫌だ
果てしない方へざわめくだけ

戻れない場所に焦がれ　思いを馳せ
囚われた明日を掴む

どうしようもなく救いのないこの世界を生きていくの
だからせめて君のその手を離さない、いいでしょ？
真理なんて関係ないの　目を閉じて祈るだけじゃ嫌だ
弾かれるように求めるだけ

,無数の検討を重ねた末にたどり着いた 言葉を知りたい
,
,語られなかった幻想でもこの心の中で信じて
,曖昧さを定義し続け確固たる無になっていく
,透明な意識の中でこの不透明な状態を知る
,その一瞬だけを捉えて幻のように生きる

,君にとって重要だけど考慮する理由はないさ
,信用ならない人でも時に重要な鍵を握る

,I see friends shaking hands, sayin' "how do you do?"
,They're really sayin' "I love you"

,Billie Jean
,Michael Jackson
,She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
,I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
,Who will dance on the floor in the round
,She said I am the one will dance on the floor in the round
,She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
,Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
,People always told me be careful of what you do
,And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
,And mother always told me be careful of who you love
,And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
,Billie Jean is not my lover
,She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
,But the kid is not my son
,She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
,For forty days and forty nights
,The law was on her side
,But who can stand when she's in demand
,Her schemes and plans
,'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
,So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
,(Do think twice)
,She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
,Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
,'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
,She came and stood right by me
,Then the smell of sweet perfume
,This happened much too soon
,She called me to her room
,
,Evening sky in May
,Nothing left to say
,But distant star
,They passed so far and mystery
,Flowers in the spring
,whispers in the wind
,A world of life
,And free from strive you brought to me
,All of my life
,All of my life
,All of my life
,My heart has been opened to the world I see
,Golden autumn days
,Sunlight through the hands
,Your love and nice that passed fly and stays in my mind
,All of my life
,All of my life
,All of my life
,My heart has been opened to the world I see
,Feel the seasons come and go
,Surrender to the beauty of the moment

,What should I call this happy madness that I feel inside of me
,Some kind of wild October gladness that I never thought I'd see
,What has become of all my sadness all my endless lonely sighs
,Where are my sorrows now

,Standing grinning in the mirror really me
,I'd like to run through Central Park carve your initials in the bark
,of every tree I pass for every one to see

,What do I care if I'm a juvenile I smile my secret little smile
,Because I know the change in me is you
,What should I call this happy madness all this unexpected joy

,The god's are laughing far above One of them gave a little shove
,And I fell gaily gladly madly into love

,Mon nom ne vous dit rien
,Vous devez ignorer
,Que nous sommes voisins
,Depuis le mois de mai
,Mes cheveux sont chatains
,Mon air est détaché
,Vous sentez mon parfum
,Tous les soirs sur le palier
,Je vous ai apercu
,Salle des pas perdus
,Un soir, était-ce à St Lazare ?
,Avec une inconnue
,Coiffée d'un fichu, jacquard
,Vous portiez sa guitare
,
,Si j'ose néanmoins,
,Vous écrire ce billet
,C'est pour tenez vous bien
,C'est pour vous déclarer
,Ma flamme et mon chagrin
,Mais aussi mes regrets
,De ne vous avoir pas
,Suivi sur le quai
,Et de n'avoir pas su
,Salle des pas perdus
,Vous dire quel était mon désir c'est bizarre

,And those of us with ravaged faces
,Lacking in the social graces
,Desperately remained at home
,Inventing lovers on the phone
,Who called to say "come dance with me"
,And murmured vague obscenities
,It isn't all it seems at seventeen
,I learned the truth at seventeen
,That love was meant for beauty queens
,And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
,Who married young and then retired
,The valentines I never knew
,The Friday night charades of youth
,Were spent on one more beautiful
,At seventeen I learned the truth
,A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
,Whose name I never could pronounce
,Said: "Pity please the ones who serve
,They only get what they deserve"
,The rich relationed hometown queen
,Marries into what she needs
,With a guarantee of company
,And haven for the elderly
,So remember those who win the game
,Lose the love they sought to gain
,In debitures of quality and dubious integrity
,Their small-town eyes will gape at you
,In dull surprise when payment due
,Exceeds accounts received at seventeen
,To those of us who knew the pain
,Of valentines that never came
,And those whose names were never called
,When choosing sides for basketball
,It was long ago and far away
,the world was younger than today
,when dreams were all they gave for free
,to ugly duckling girls like me
,We all play the game, and when we dare
,We cheat ourselves at solitaire
,Repenting other lives unknown
,That call and say: "Come on, dance with me"
,And murmur vague obscenities
,At ugly girls like me,at seventeen
,
, At last my love has come along
, My lonely days are over
, And life is like a song
, Yeah
, At last the sky above is blue
, My heart was wrapped in clover
, The night I looked at you
, I found a dream that I could speak to
, A dream to call my own
, I found the thrill to press my cheek to
, A thrill I never known
, But you smiled
, You smiled and then the spell was cast
, And here we are in heaven
, For you are mine at last
, For you are mine at last
, I found a dream that I could speak to
, A dream to call my own
, I found a thrill to press my cheek to
, A thrill I never known
, But you smiled
, You smiled and then the spell was cast
, And here we are in heaven
, For you are mine at last
﻿Quiet nights of quiet stars 
quiet cords from my guitar 
floating on the silence that surrounds us 
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams 
quiet walks by quiet streams 
and the window looking on the mountains 
and the sea how lovely

here with you so close to me 
Until the final flicker of life's ember 
I who was lost and lonely 
believing life was only 
a bitter tragic joke 
have found with you 
the meaning of existence

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
 Toi tu m'aimais, et je t'aimais
 Et nous vivions, tous deux ensemble
 Toi qui m'aimait, moi qui t'aimais
 Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
 Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
 Et la mer efface sur le sable
 Le pas des amants désunis

Yeah baby, I've been drinking,
And I shouldn't come by I know
But I found myself in trouble darling,
And I had nowhere else to go
Got some whiskey from a bar man,
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on moving,
Till I was back in your arms again
Well I'm guilty, yeah I'm guilty,
I'll be guilty for the rest of my life
How come I never do,
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing that I try to do ever turns out right
Well you know how it is with me baby,
You know I just can't stand myself
It takes a whole lot of medicine,
For me to pretend to be somebody else.

,Baby, I'm sailing away
,But I'm missing you
,On a blue holiday
,Gardenia perfume
,Blows through my sails
,Out on an open ocean
,The blossoms fade to pale
,Under the moon
,On a blue holiday
,But every time I think of you
,I sink into a deeper blue
,The blue of your beautiful eyes
,As twilight turns to starry skies
,You're alone at home
,And I'm lonely in paradise
,I order our drinks
,And toss you a grin
,You catch with a wink
,And you whisper, "Kiss me again"
,But it's just fantasy
,On a blue holiday
,But every time I think of you
,I sink into a deeper blue
,The blue of your beautiful eyes
,As twilight turns to starry skies
,You're alone at home
,And I'm lonely in paradise
,I stare at the waves
,And stroll down the beach
,I'd hold you close, oh, but baby
,You're so far out of reach
,Of my solitude
,On this blue holiday
,Hm, blue holiday
,It doesn\'t teally matter where you\'re coming from
,It\'s no concern of mine where you are bound
,Your move from A to B is basic geometry
,The shortest line is me
,Spare me lengthy tales of pain and misery
,Of how you once were lost...but now are found

,Expecting me to go along with all that you do
,Shame on you
,Go play your game of hide-and-seek
,With someboddy new

,Expecting me to go along with all that you do

,On a blue holiday
,Gardenia perfume
,Blows through my sails

,Under the moon
,On a blue holiday
,But every time I think of you
,I sink into a deeper blue
,The blue of your beautiful eyes
,As twilight turns to starry skies
,You're alone at home
,And I'm lonely in paradise
,I order our drinks
,And toss you a grin
,You catch with a wink
,And you whisper, "Kiss me again"
,But it's just fantasy
,On a blue holiday
,But every time I think of you
,I sink into a deeper blue
,The blue of your beautiful eyes
,As twilight turns to starry skies
,You're alone at home
,And I'm lonely in paradise
,I stare at the waves
,And stroll down the beach
,I'd hold you close, oh, but baby
,You're so far out of reach
,Of my solitude
,On this blue holiday

,I really can't stay
,Baby, it's cold outside
,I've got to go away
,Baby, it's cold outside
,This evening has been so very nice
,Been hoping that you'd drop in
,I'll hold your hands
,They're just like ice
,My mother will start to worry
,Beautiful, what's your hurry?
,My father will be pacing the floor
,Listen to the fireplace roar
,So really I'd better scurry
,Beautiful, please don't hurry
,But maybe just a half a drink more
,I'll put some records on while I pour
,The neighbors might think
,Baby, it's bad out there
,Say, what's in this drink?
,No cabs to be had out there
,I wish I knew how
,Your eyes are like starlight
,To break this spell
,I'll take your hat
,Your hair looks swell
,I ought to say no, no, no, sir
,Mind if I move in closer?
,At least I'm gonna say that I tried
,What's the sense in hurting my pride?
,I really can't stay
,Baby, don't hold out
,Baby, it's cold outside
,Uh, you're very pushy, you know?
,I like to think of it as optimistic
,I simply must go
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The answer is no
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The welcome has been so nice and warm
,How lucky that you dropped in
,Look out the window at that storm
,My sister will be suspicious
,Gosh, your lips look delicious
,My brother will be there at the door
,Waves upon a tropical shore
,My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
,Gosh, your lips are delicious
,But maybe just a cigarette more
,Never such a blizzard before
,And I don't even smoke
,I've got to get home
,Baby, you'll freeze out there
,Say, lend me your coat
,It's up to your knees out there
,You've really been grand
,I thrill when you touch my hand
,But don't you see
,How can you do this thing to me?
,There's bound to be talk tomorrow
,Think of my life long sorrow
,At least there will be plenty implied
,If you caught pneumonia and died
,I really can't stay
,Get over that hold out
,Baby, it's cold
,Baby it's cold outside
,Okay fine, just another drink then
,That took a lot of convincing
,in my solitude
,you haunt me
,With reveries
,of days gone by
,in my solitude
,you taunt me
,with memories
,that never die
,i sit in my chair
,and filled with despair
,theres no one could be so sad
,with gloom everywhere
,i sit and i stare
,i know that ill soon go mad
,in my solitude
,I'm praying
,dear lord above
,send back my love
,
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

,To sing in the trees
,Someone to bless me

,And I forget why I'm mad
,I ought to tell him "drop dead!"

,I think of the days
,We spend so far away
,When love began
,Days seem a long time gone now
,Remember the many times we walk that bay
,Why don't we go back again
,
,Watching the waves blash on the beach
,Summer rathers ripped
,In each others arms
,Together we gaves than to sky at night
,In paradise with you
,
,Come of the days
,Until we leave
,And this time will stay
,A sunny days are waiting him
,My bags are back tonight we're wearing the go
,Just you and me back again
,
,Between of those
,We'll fell the same
,We'll be the same
,Another twin clean stars
,And the one reveries we wil be holding hands
,This could last never more
,
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas
what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those
hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With boy thought I told
you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind
I wish those days could
come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could
come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in
this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy
after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing
something nasty on the wall you nasty boy
Teacher sends you to the
principal's office down the wall
You grow up and learn
that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin'it
it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could
come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could
come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Holly came from miami f.l.a.
Hitch-hiked her way across the u.s.a.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her leg and then he was a she
She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
Candy came from out on the island
In the backroom she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was given head
She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
And the coloured girls go
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Little joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New york city is the place where they said
Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
I said hey joe, take a walk on the wild side
Sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the apollo
You should have seen him go go go
They said, hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side
I said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
All right, huh
Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was james dean for a day
Then i guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that dash
She said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
I said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
And the coloured girls say
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

, You bet is waiting soft and warm

, And the sun has gone to sleep
, Do you hear
, Twinking stars are in the sky
, Now
, As the morning smiling down
, Let us sing our litter song
, Hush

, I'll stay awhile here by your side
, Close your eyes

Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
There you go day and night
Up in the clouds flying so high
You try your best to stretch your mind
Beyond reality and sense and rhyme
You see things make your big heart sing
Like the flowers trees and birds and pretty things
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
You like to step aside
Then you release yourself and fly
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day
Now the paisly pages of your mind
Are so complete like seeing colours black and white
Do you realize that you look so spaced out
You've made your peace with the need to be free
Without a doubt
Yeah I frown 'cause something don't look right
It's the twinkly twinkle star thats in your eyes
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
So go on and step aside
And release yourself and fly
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If ya live to learn you'll be lucky one day
You know you gotta
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If the life you live is a spinning top of pain then you can
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
If you live to learn you'll be lucky one day

Over over over and over

A popularity of invasion
Handed down through centuries
A force of arms called gentle persuasion
What have we learned from history
Apparently nothing

Chorus:
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently

Human worth is so inexpensive
Compared to gold, the root of most wars
Subtract the tears from countless offences
What is left but guns and scars
Apparently nothing

Chorus

Well as for me I'm gonna keep loving
'Cause it's the only sane thing to do
'Cause I'm not into pushin' and shovin'
,
No confrontation, what have you
Apparently nothing

Chorus

Yeah, yeah

I ain't trying to rule your mind
A conscious observer trying to find
A place on Earth where they heed the signs
Beware of conflicts that ruin unkind
If you want things move better
Withstand the tides of the bad weather
The struggle thrives when we all gather
Down at the bank of the soul river
Yeah

A baby is crying
A mother is dying
A leader is swearing
But no one is caring... about
Apparently nothing

Chorus

See the light
See the light
See the light
