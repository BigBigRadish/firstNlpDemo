,Travelers on an unending voyage of discovery
,A voyage fueled by desire to know our true calling
,Seeking for timeless wisdom beneath the ever changing depths of heaven
,Trapped in confusion
,Armed with melodies to strike our emotions
,Waging the war within
,Until one day
,Sooner or later we see
,This music is our destiny
,Sooner or later we see
,Follow me, fo-follow me
,Follow me down
,As we walk through the valley in the shadow of death
,They shall fear no evil
,Headhunterz are back
,Sooner or later we see
,Follow me, fo-follow me
,Just take my hand
,Just take my, just take my, just take my...
,Just take my hand
,Just take my, just take my
,Just take my hand

,Follow me down, follow me down,me down
,This is our destiny
,Fo-follow
,Follow me, fo-follow me

,And trust me I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

吐き出した孤独という名の雲
その雲が雨を降らせて
虹が出るどうせ掴めないのに
初めてのキスを繰り返して欲しくて
愛が僕に噛み付いて
離さないと言うけれど
さみしさの形は 変ならないみたいだ
舞い上がって行け
いつか夜の向こう側
うんざりするほど光れ君の歌
優しさが濁った日々の
憂鬱は満員電車みたいだ
冷めた温もりを
むやみに放り投げた
僕が愛を信じても
きっといなくなるんだろ
それならいらない
悲しすぎるから
さようならさえも
上手く言えなそうだから
手を振る代わりに抱きしめてみたよ
流れ星を見た流れ星を見た

そばにいるだけで
本当幸せだったな
そばにいるだけで
ただそれだけでさ

離さないと言うけれど

舞い上がって行け

你曾用一块块石头
堆积起我的家
你曾用一根根木头
搭建起防御塔
部落的城墙
印记着你的汗水挥洒
沙盘上的阵型
它是你唯一的想法
巨人将你的箭塔撞毁
骑士冲进了你的堡垒
野蛮人将你的城墙推到
就像孩子是母亲的宝
他们的不懂事闯的祸
故事就发生在 冲突部落

看着辛勤的成果付之流水 
感觉一切付出心血都是白费
收拾行囊将木屋关紧
选择离开不要问我原因
再也看不到那相伴的日出风景
是否真的后悔过
我问过我自己
却在心低哭泣
红花总要回归土地里
如尘埃一般随风散去
这一生的使命早已刻上了烙印
该如何抉择命运
不想再听天由命
价值背后的艰辛
也许你也和我一样固执
但 那是曾经
但 那是曾经
所有的付出并非无用之功 
他们有了你才能够无畏
不断向前冲
失去了你的部落 
除了难过 还有什么好说 
有一个地方需要你
快点 回家
快点 回家 
你曾用一块块石头
堆积起我的家
你曾用一根根木头
搭建起防御塔
部落的城墙印记着
你的汗水挥洒
沙盘上的阵型
它是你唯一的想法
毁掉的箭塔可以重建
打乱的沙盘可以再现
只有你能胜任大本营的扩建
即刻出发 马上回家 
有一个地方需要你
快点出发 马上回家
望着眼前的场景 
没有改变的心情 
野猪骑士依旧欢乐的四处乱撞 
掘地矿工依旧破坏着地表土壤 
也许一切从未改变
只有你才能包容一切
因为有你的日日夜夜不曾停歇
部落繁荣 才能实现
你的名字刻在了城墙上
风吹日打 也不会让世人遗忘
这些都是你努力的成绩
属于你的荣誉
谁也抹不去
在你离开之前
并不知道它重要的意义
可当你离开之后
才知道 你是多么的不可代替
有一个地方需要你 
我们就守在这里 
等你 回家
有一个地方需要你 
我们就守在这里 
等你回家 等你回家

,But tonight I'm here, yours again
,But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
,Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
,Heart is sinking like a cannonball
,Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?
,Something in the way you move
,There's something in the way you do it
,Something in the way you move
,Oh
,There's something in the way you move
,Something in the way you do it
,Something in the way you move
,Oh
,There's an evil night air, the stars don't shine tonight,
,There's something in the way you do
,There's something in the way you
,Push me closer, further
,Break me just enough
,Your lies always seem so true
,There's nothing left for me to lose
,There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
,But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
,When our eyes meet, I can only see the end
,And tonight the rain pours again
,But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
,Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
,Heart is sinking like a cannonball
,Baby, kill it, what you waiting for?

,Oh
,There's something in the way you move
,Something in the way you do it
,Something in the way you move
,Oh
,Fighting flames with fire
,Hang onto burning wires
,We don’t care anymore
,Are we fading lovers?
,We keep wasting colors
,Maybe we should let this go
,We’re falling apart, still we hold together
,We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever
,Cause this is all we know
,This feeling’s all we know
,I’ll ride my bike up to the world
,Down the streets right through the city
,I’ll go everywhere you go
,From Chicago to the coast
,You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go
,Blow the smoke right through the window”
,Cause this is all we know
,Never face each other
,One bed, different covers
,We don’t care anymore
,Two hearts still beating
,On with different rhythms
,Maybe we should let this go
,We’re falling apart, still we hold together
,We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever
,Cause this is all we know
,This feeling’s all we know
,I’ll ride my bike up to the would
,Down the streets right through the city
,I’ll go everywhere you go
,From Chicago to the coast
,You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go
,Blow the smoke right through the window”
,Cause this is all we know

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose
,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing
,And I was runnin' outta luck

,Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's
,No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
,Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
,Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall full of plaques
,Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
,Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?Hoe please
,You better bow down on both knees
,Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
,Who you think brought you the oldies?
,Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's
,The Snoop D-O-double-G's and the group that said mother-"Fuck Tha Police"
,Gave you a tape full of dope beats to bump when you stroll through in your hood
,And when your album sales wasn't doin too good who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
,Y'all better listen up closely
,All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped
,Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
,So FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME!

,I woke up pissed off today
,And lately everyone feels fake
,Somewhere I lost a piece of me
,Smoking cigarettes on balconies
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,Last year took a toll on me
,But I made it with you next to me
,Around the world and back again
,I hope you're waiting at the end
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river

,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,I'll be loud for you
,I got you I promise
,Let me be honest
,Love is a road that goes both ways
,When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But I'm holding on to something
,Wake up if you feel nothing
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,There was a time that I was sober
,What I got to do to show you
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,So I'm running running just to keep my hands on you

,We were all lost
,Almost something so close
,On the outlines of your west coast
,We were waving red balloons
,We were wide-eyed
,Oh, we only lived in highlights
,A delusion, some were twilight
,We were dumb and beautiful
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,And no one else would ever do
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you

,We were perish
,We were subtle, we were drastic
,We were calm, we were dramatic
,We were fantasy and fear
,And you changed me
,You were sunny and you faced me
,Yeah, you saw me and encouraged me
,Like a tourist, souvenir (woah)
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew

,We were both young when I first saw you.
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
,I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
,See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
,See you make your way through the crowd
,And say, "Hello."
,Little did I know...
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes,
,Escape this town for a little while.
,Oh, oh.
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,But you were everything to me,
,I was begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
,I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
,Romeo, save me.
,They're trying to tell me how to feel.
,This love is difficult but it's real.
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say...

,Cos there's fire in my heart
,And I don't know where it start
,I'm searching where I know
,And if I had crystal ball
,Would wanna know it all

,Because of this midnight
,And I dreaming while awake

,And less plausibility

,I don't need to have control
,Got feeling in my soul
,Don't kown why my life is get stoned

,乌云在我们心里刻下一块阴影
,我聆听沉寂已久的心情
,清晰透明 就像美丽的风景
,总在回忆里才看的清
,被伤透的心能不能够继续爱我
,我用力牵起没温度的双手
,过往温柔 已经被时间上锁
,只剩挥散不去的难过
,缓缓掉落的枫叶像思念
,我点燃烛火温暖岁末的秋天
,极光掠过天边
,北风掠过想你的容颜
,我把爱烧成了落叶
,却换不回熟悉的那张脸
,缓缓掉落的枫叶像思念
,为何挽回要赶在冬天来之前
,爱你穿越时间
,两行来自秋末的眼泪
,让爱渗透了地面
,我要的只是你在我身边
,被伤透的心能不能够继续爱我
,我用力牵起没温度的双手
,过往温柔 已经被时间上锁
,只剩挥散不去的难过
,在山腰间飘逸的红雨
,随著北风凋零 我轻轻摇曳风铃
,想 唤醒被遗弃的爱情
,雪花已铺满了地
,深怕窗外枫叶已结成冰
,缓缓掉落的枫叶像思念
,我点燃烛火温暖岁末的秋天

,我就知道自己快到家了
,大风卷走叶子 把灵魂丢给春天
,这是我最终要归回的家乡
,即使有再多践踏你的车辆
,我想永远守着你我的家乡
,却不知明天的船舶停靠在何方
,最终我会回来安静的陪在你的身旁

,雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水
,院子落叶 跟我的思念厚厚一叠
,几句是非 也无法将我的热情冷却
,你出现在我诗的每一页
,整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水
,窗台蝴蝶 像诗里纷飞的美丽章节
,我接着写 把永远爱你写进诗的结尾
,你是我唯一想要的了解

,这蜿蜒的微笑拥抱山丘
,溪流跟风唱起歌
,我像田园诗人般解读眼前的生活
,麦田弯腰低头在垂钓温柔
,这整座山谷都是风笛手
,我在哑口聆听传说跟着童话故事走
,远方的风车
,远距离诉说
,那幸福在深秋
,满满的被收割
,老仓库的角落
,我们数着一麻袋的爱跟快乐
,初恋的颜色
,我牵着你的手经过
,种麦芽糖的山坡
,香浓的诱惑
,你脸颊微热
,吐气在我的耳朵
,摘下麦芽糖熟透
,我醒来还笑着

,终有个 结局圆满
,你看 顽皮细雨招摇过远帆
,修理过小店某处忽明忽暗的灯盏
,你听 江水流过人家吵着要上岸
,你去过烟花三月的江南
,你看 秋月温柔撕破了花瓣
,却只为迎着暮冬大雪纷飞时贪玩
,你说 要忘却所有不愉快的片段
,把美好事物纯真的走完
,把疲乏往期 装进朴质的长街
,把失败恋爱 藏进路人的详谈
,把起舞的今日 写成诗篇
,多年后 也不遗憾
,把无味春风 融进街边的早餐
,把仰头月色 化为潇洒的释然
,把漫长的故事 变成短暂
,才配得起勇敢
,别忧愁聚散
,又何惧放胆
,让幽邃夜晚
,静躺入空山

,一切都很平淡不觉出彩
,雨落时才想起那种心安
,欢声和笑语还在我耳畔
,如今已各自在城市两端
,相距远相见难不聚只散
,其实我并没有太多期盼
,毕竟一生很短少有圆满
,春末 傍晚
,云层渐远

,醒来时思断
,剩寒意盘旋

,越来越遥远，城市的灯
,一个人，冰冷的嘴唇
,远处传来谁的哭声

,Welcome to New York
,Taylor Swift
,
,Walking through a crowd, the village is a globe.
,Kaleidoscopes of loud heartbeats under coats.
,Everybody here wanted something more,
,Searching for a sound we haven’t heard before.
,
,And it said welcome to New York, It’s been waiting for you
,Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
,Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
,Welcome to New York, welcome to New York.
,
,It’s a new soundtrack I can dance to this beat,
,forevermore.
,The light are so bright but they never blind me, me.
,Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
,Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
,
,When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors,
,took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer.
,Everybody here was someone else before,
,And you can want who you want,
,boys & boys and girls & girls.
,
,Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you.
,Welcome to New York, welcome to New York.
,Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you.
,Welcome to New York, welcome to New York.
,It’s a new soundtrack I can dance to this beat,
,forevermore.

,The light are so bright but they never blind me, me.
,Welcome to New York (New York), it’s been waiting for you
,Welcome to New York, Welcome to New York
,
,Like any great love, it keeps you guessing.
,Like any real love, it’s ever changing.
,Like any true love, it drives you crazy.
,But you know you wouldn’t change, anything, anything,
,Anything..

,Time feels like it's slipping away from me
,Rewind to the days where we ran free
,Locked in where these colors fade back to gray
,But hold on 'cause I'm going to break away
,I hear you calling for
,me to lead my lights out and see through
,a sky that's bright now to meet you
,and make the stars come out
,Could I fix these
,Lost and fragmented pieces
,of forgotten hope that I needed
,and pretend they're not all gone?
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, I'll make an escape
,
,Float back to these oceans where I fall asleep
,I swim up even though I drown into the deep
,Lights flick as the pendelum ceases swings
,It's only seconds 'til these walls cave in
,I'm asking you to help wake me
,from these nightmares and save me
,let my thoughts fade away to memories
,that all made perfect sense
,Hyponotize me,
,this twilight where I can think clear
,and make this wish that you'll be here
,to stop these falling tears
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, I'll make an escape

,All I could think about
,Is just you and I
,Walking along the streets
,Singing songs together, songs together
,24/7 wanna know how you feel
,Don’t know if you still care
,About the times we used to share
,Cuz its seems like you have left, to a different place
,Far away from me
,You have moved on with your life
,I’m no longer on your mind
,But you’re still not out of mine
,I’ve been drowning in my thoughts thinking you were never with me
,Screaming into air reminiscing what we could be
,But honestly it was all just empty promises that
,You and I both know that it would never be reality
,Being with you was the safest feeling that I’ve ever had
,But now thats fucking gone and you will never ever look back
,Now it seems like I’m the only one who’s hurting while you
,Went off to the great escape to find yourself a better place
,I’m no longer on your mind
,But you’re still not out of mine
,I can’t keep anything by my side
,Your gone, you’ve left me here all alone
,Please come, I still need you by my side
,I’ve lost, you’ve won with you final dance
,You’ve shot me, down right from where I stand

,She said I was nice
,But she's not into guys
,I found a girl
,I found a girl
,Who's in love with a girl
,She said, that she tried

,Oh, why? Tell me why
,Did I fall for those eyes?
,She said I was nice

,I found a girl
,All these kinds of places
,Make it seem like it's been ages
,Tomorrow's sun with buildings scraping skies
,I love this country dearly
,I can feel the ladder clearly
,But I never thought I'd be alone to try
,Once I was outside Penn Station
,Selling red and white carnations
,We were still alone, my wife and I
,Before we marry, save my money
,Brought my dear wife over
,Now I want to bring my family state side
,But off the boat they stayed awhile
,Then scattered 'cross the coast
,Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk
,I take a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk
,Practice isn't perfect
,But the market cuts its loss
,I remind myself that times could be much worse
,My wife won't ask me questions
,There's not so much to ask
,And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
,Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
,Then decided she will stay the rest of her life
,I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
,And sit and pray they never feel my strife
,But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
,He made some bad investments
,Now the accounts are overdrawn
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk.
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk
,Honey it's your son
,I think I borrowed just to much
,We had taxes
,We had bills
,We had a lifestyle of fun
,But I swear tonight I'll come home
,And we'll make love like we're young
,And tomorrow you'll cook dinner
,For the neighbors and their kids
,We can rip apart the socialists
,and all their damn taxes
,You'll see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees
,I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk.
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk.
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk.
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
,Take a walk, take a walk.
,
,Take cover beneath the stars
,White candles and cherry rum
,A mirror and you the glass
,'Cause baby we are, we are the night
,Lay whispers beneath our ears
,My excuse is your alibi
,Held ransom to how we feel
,'Cause baby we are, we are the night
,
,The lights go off, its sparks are drumming in my heart
,Its spell, too much
,There's magic in your eyes
,The two of us are fighting to ignite
,'Cause we are the night

,Two strangers in perfect time

I can't imagine life, without you by my side
This is love babe, that I'm feelin'
And I'm hopin' that you're feelin' the same way
Things tend to slip my mind, like how you like to wine
And dine babe, with romantic lights,
You mean a lot to me in so many ways
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(Lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well tell me what you want, babe
Don't think twice of our love, I say these things because I love you
But it's hard to explain, and I'm hopin' that you're feelin' the same way
You know that all of my feelings are inside and burning,
I tend to forget,
How much I L-O-V-E you really mean.
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(lately) have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want, babe
Try your hardest to deal, Yes I forgot but You know how I feel,
Things slip my mind babe, that's a fact,
Tell me you love me and I'll tell you back baby
(freestyle)
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(lately) have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well tell me what you want, babe

,And now I know,
,I'm better sleeping on my own
,And if you like the way you look that much
,Oh baby you should go and love yourself
,And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
,You should go and love yourself
,You should go and love yourself
,Yeah.You should go and love yourself
,You should go and love yourself

,
,Your home disappears in a rearview
,Like the night's been near you
,Guess I'm too used to leaving
,Fit my life in the back of my van
,It wasn't part of your plan
,Don't play for keeps
,I roll my window down
,What if you were here to stay (whoa)
,You can move me like the wind
,When it calls me by my name
,In the city sky
,No stars to find
,Take me to a place
,Where no one else can go
,I left no goodbye
,Right before your eyes
,Hope you come around
,I'll be your lost and found
,Blew a kiss thinking it might
,Convince you to come home with me
,Deep down I know you near
,Seaside air mixed with you tangled hair
,Under the moonlight's stare
,No need to speak
,I roll my window down
,What if you were here to stay (whoa)
,You can move me like the wind
,When it calls me by my name
,In the city sky
,No stars to find
,Take me to a place
,Where no one else can go
,I left no goodbye

,Just beyond our fingertips
,Stucking in the feeling

,Put that song on replay
,
,Don't worry now, look what we've found
,We don't have to go all in
,Head in the clouds, both looking down
,Doesn't mean that we're falling
,
,We can keep it simple, baby
,Let's not make it complicated
,Labels are so overrated
,Let's not make it complicated
,Rules are made for breaking, baby
,Let's not make it complicated
,Why don't we just go get naked
,Let's not make it complicated
,
,Let's not make it complicated
,Let's not make it complicated
,
,Skinny dip at night, I can see your eyes
,Searching through the shadows
,You don't have to fight, I'll let you decide
,I can help you let go

,When it went down
,It was so hard to breathe
,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine~~~
,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace

,So I heard you found somebody else
,And at first I thought it was a lie
,So I took all my things that make sounds
,And the rest I can do without
,
,I don't want your body
,But I hate to think about you with somebody else
,A love gone cold
,You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
,I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
,And leaving with somebody else

,This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
,Come on, baby

,Too late. I don't love you anymore. Goodbye.
,Here's the truth, so now you can hate me.
,Larry fucked me all night.
,I enjoyed it. I came.
,I prefer you. Now go.
,I knew that. He told me.
,You knew?
,I needed to hear it from you.
,Why?
,Because he might have been lying. I had to hear it from you.
,I would never have told you,
,Because I know you would have never forgived me.
,I would. I have.
,Why did he tell you?
,Because he's a bastard.
,How could he?
,Because he wanted this to happen.
,But why test me?
,Because I'm an idiot.
,Yes. I would have loved you... forever. Now, please go.
,Don't do this, Alice. Please, talk to me.
,I am talking. Fuck off.
,I'm sorry. You misunderstand! I didn't mean to.
,Yes you did.
,I love you!
,Where?
,What?
,Show me! Where is this love?
,I... I can't see it, I can't touch it.
,I can't feel it. I can hear it. I can hear some words,
,But I can't do anything with your easy words.
,Whatever you say is too late.
,Please, don't do this!
,Done.
,Now, please go, or I'll call security.
,No, you're not in a strip club, there is no security.
,Why did you fuck him?
,I wanted to.
,Why?!
,I desired him.
,Why?!
,You weren't there!
,Why him?!
,He asked me nicely.
,You're a liar.
,So?
,Who are you?
,I'm no one!

,I dont’ ever wanna fall in love again
,after all the agony I’m in
,I don’t ever wanna fall in love
,ever again
,I don’t ever wanna fall fall fall fall fall in love
,falling through the sin you’re dead to me babe
,I don’t ever wanna fall in love
,ever again
,I don’t ever wanna fall fall fall fall fall in love
,cause after all falling out
,after falling down
,you leave me paper thin
,
,
,
,
,
,It all started with closed eyes
,And a feeling in my gut telling me
,I need to keep them shut the whole time.
,Because they opened even for a second and I saw your lips
,They'd suck me in like black holes when they bend light
,And it was then I realized you were not my world
,You were my universe.
,Sometimes when I look up I see stars
,That cut through the sky and fade quickly into nothingness
,And I pray that you aren't as fleeting
,Because when we're lying in roads I get the same feeling
,That gravity will just turn off and I'll fall endlessly
,Into something much larger than I am
,And I wonder if that's what it feels like to die and
,If I'll ever understand God in my lifespan
,Because I want to see God
,I want to know what God feels like
,But with the weight of the bible
,I will break Adams ribs
,And repeat, my dear Eve, you do not take after this
,You were not made in a mans image
,But if that's the case why do you feel so lost
,Why do I wait wondering how long it'll take you to admit it
,I'd rather keep my mouth shut then start to say what I can't finish
,Baby i have limits
,I have limits
,So I'm singing 'la la la' in empty rooms that carry sounds like hollow caves,
,'La la la' just to prove you're not the only one that can occupy a borrowed space,
,'La la la' for every ship that was set to sail but got washed away,
,I'm singing 'la la la' in desperate hopes that when it bounces back I hear the octave change,
,So if we could just pretend that your voice exists inside this empty void within,
,Then holy shit, holy shit, holy shit if you spoke,
,Insomnia might loosen its wholesome grip on my throat
,And i can begin to forgive you for admitting the hoax
,Instead of learning to hate you for very minute you don't
,Because I sit here wondering if anything you said was true
,And who it was that taught you to speak bullets
,Without considering the exit wound
,Tell me who
,Because I still think back to the first time you called me with nothing to say
,That morning you were more than just my friend and we both noticed something had changed
,You drove to your parents house and we talked about everything
,We talked about how much it sucked, but no matter what, we had to remain
,Nothing.
,And in that deafening silence,
,I asked if I could still call you my snowflake
,And you said okay
,You said okay.
,You said okay.
,
,Cherry blossoms falling gently on me
,Warmth of sunshine gleaming
,Dancing on my skin
,butterflies soaring all around me

,把麦克风紧握在手里试试能否继续唱
,这是一封写给我十年后的信
,在十年之后我是否为说唱还在拼
,那青春的梦是否已经淡忘
,只能在街边看着年轻人在弹唱
,都说为了说唱把青春浪费
,现在不后悔十年后也不会
,因为我们有梦 也追过
,我自豪的说青春我也曾挥霍
,也许会坠落 悬崖 我愿
,十年后也不想跳出这 音乐的火圈
,这条不归路也许我不是第一个
,我相信十年后他们都放弃我依然在做
,即使傻 也要傻出自己的特点
,对于说唱我不愿只看 他 的侧脸
,虽然玩到现在所谓的名气还是没有得到
,自己喜欢就好不求说唱给我回报
,这是一封写给十年后的信···

,她的名字刻在我的心上 永远不会忘
,她是一个老北京的 漂亮姑娘
,认识她的那个夏天 花儿芬芳
,多么美妙 她就 走在我的身旁
,她喜欢鼓楼的味道 和我一样
,她热爱摇滚乐 爱的那么痴狂
,时过境迁 给她的爱 是否牵强
,为你祝福 亲爱的漂亮姑娘
,她是一个摇滚蜜 她漂亮的手很细
,她看似大大咧咧 其实内心却很细腻
,她遇到事儿很冷静 从不大声尖叫
,她名字不太好写 你得多读多看报
,第一次的擦身而过 她穿着海魂衫
,黑色的靴子有处纹身露在腰间
,金黄色的头发右手手指夹着香烟
,和姐们儿进了一家饭馆儿坐下聊着天
,对她第一次的印象就是这个姑娘太混
,她看都没看我一眼这让我有点郁闷
,后来见到几次 她和我哥们儿认识
,地球实在太小总有这么巧的事儿
,慢慢的逗着咳嗽 她说我长的真瘦
,我问她到底多高 她说1米77左右
,她总是喜欢抽金桥 一买就是一条儿
,红色嘴唇儿叼着烟把这一根儿又点着
,她的名字刻在我的心上 永远不会忘
,她是一个老北京的 漂亮姑娘
,认识她的那个夏天 花儿芬芳
,多么美妙 她就 走在我的身旁
,她喜欢鼓楼的味道 和我一样
,她热爱摇滚乐 爱的那么痴狂
,时过境迁 给她的爱 是否牵强
,为你祝福 亲爱的漂亮姑娘
,渐渐的走的很近 她抽烟频率很勤
,她天生就是爷们儿性格我喜欢她的声音
,每当她走在街上总能赚足回头率
,她的脾气有时不好说话喜欢直来直去
,我喜欢和她呆在一起 那种感觉真好
,她说我不像其他男人对她动手动脚
,彼此的那种好感一层窗户纸没捅破
,我喜欢你这四个字 谁也没有先说
,慢慢的厌倦平淡等待这种感觉无奈
,年少无知的我那时说不在就不在
,她很难过但没有说 心里只是诧异
,给我写了一封信 删除所有联系
,经历了大风大浪后悔当初决定不该做
,没了时间见面也没有机会对她说
,她找到新的幸福我却依旧孤独
,抽着她最爱的金桥心里太不舒服
,她的名字刻在我的心上 永远不会忘
,她是一个老北京的 漂亮姑娘
,认识她的那个夏天 花儿芬芳
,多么美妙 她就 走在我的身旁
,她喜欢鼓楼的味道 和我一样
,她热爱摇滚乐 爱的那么痴狂
,时过境迁 给她的爱 是否牵强
,为你祝福 亲爱的漂亮姑娘
,时间一晃真快 小三年这样过去
,那天找我哥们儿喝酒 和她再一次的相聚
,啤酒不用杯 我们直接对着瓶儿吹
,聊着过去的事儿时不时的弹着烟灰
,经历了太多事情 我们成熟了不少
,不得不承认的是我们也在慢慢变老
,这几年她的变化很大 我还在玩着hipa
,干了一大口说出憋在心里的话
,谁也没有想过还会有缘再见面
,我的泪水堆积眼眶视线看不见
,她的感情方面不太圆满透着伤感
,我也只能坐着听着没有资格管
,或许是我对她的了解还是不够
,也许是她早就把我当成她朋友
,她总是对我说至少我们还活着
,然后点上一根金桥向天空吹着
,她的名字刻在我的心上 永远不会忘
,她是一个老北京的 漂亮姑娘
,认识她的那个夏天 花儿芬芳
,多么美妙 她就 走在我的身旁
,她喜欢鼓楼的味道 和我一样
,她热爱摇滚乐 爱的那么痴狂
,时过境迁 给她的爱 是否牵强

,我的哥们儿 在美国 吃香的喝辣的
,而我还在北京城 又把自己 喝大了
,燃烧的烟纸卷着雾霾 吸进了肺
,吃什么也不长肉 狼吞虎咽塞进胃
,看着不着边的房价 我早已无所谓
,都是哪儿来的钱让他们 玩 高消费
,生活很累 不到周末就想喝醉
,幻想你的Zai儿屁股又是一宿没睡
,我发了一张专辑传递了多少信息
,我去nm的不份儿的都是大
,骂的就是你 管你和谁在一起
,再跟背后BB下次就tm neng你
,喝多了整个世界 是都在旋转着
,你给所有人的感觉其实就是一钱串子
,想扎钱诈骗 那你玩就玩个大的
,狗屁的做不出来脑子还经常出现bug
,WTF 突然冒出那么多人rap
,都是一个模子刻出来的一水儿全是trap
,不想看见Hiphop变成你眼中的潮流
,就像不想看到她 为我去做RL
,看着我的爸妈 一天天变老了
,而自己还在梦想的路上一直寻找着
,有时我也想着自己也老大不小了
,其实我也害怕自己这辈子这么废了
,每一天的生活还是没有什么改变
,都是为了钱吧 那谁也别想狡辩
,去nm的理想 去nm的现实
,活的像条狗似的 事实就是事实
,还是不能改变的每天两点一线
,地铁一站一站陌生人四目相见
,不想习惯中习惯 却早已习惯
,这么苟活与人世我的未来没有期盼
,这辈子是没有机会牵起你的手了
,空酒瓶子就像一场梦也早就碎了
,是你太过物质 还是我太过固执
,婚姻需要勇气 爱情没了爱的故事
,开着破几把车在拥堵的路上转
,听着瞎几把导航开过了怎么办
,刷不见底的微博点着没有味儿的赞
,不好意思删你朋友圈儿 屏蔽了算
,人们都很寂寞 所以才会直播
,假如真的不想联系那就什么都别说
,该拿劲儿的拿劲儿 该喝酒得喝
,继续犯你sb好吧 往死了作
,总会莫名的烦 抽到烟屁才弹
,我的低着头走路 小心脚地踩着痰
,就你最有主意 就你最能BB
,就你什么都知道 怎么还是那点出息
,他们嘴上挂着respect却没有理解意思
,脏心眼儿太多了 那就不能够PEACE
,就见不得你好 也能背后使绊儿
,自己上不了道儿 就拉帮结派
,早就看腻了那些是是非非 不如尿泡滖
,闷了这口酒 明天往 美国飞
,The united states 我的哥们儿让我们干了这一杯
,哦美国
,我的日子过的
,只要坐上那班飞机
,到哪儿都是活着
,哦美国
,你曾是我的梦啊
,坐不上那班飞机
,还得这么活着

,你是否觉得自己每天过得都很疲惫
,是否忘记你的梦想觉得都已没了机会
,就像被乌云遮住双眼前方一片漆黑
,你爱过的姑娘也没有在你的身旁这依偎
,你会低迷你会觉得全世界在跟你作对
,美好的人生里面你却找不到属于你的座位
,你已经不再是那一个想要追梦的孩子
,递出的履历表上干净得像一张白纸
,我开始玩说唱的时候面对过家人的反对
,也质疑过自己 在穷酸的时候留下了眼泪
,也因为追梦 被身旁的朋友无情讽刺
,这么大的人怎么到了现在还不懂事
,我相信追梦的人不会那么轻易被打倒
,前方的障碍只是一片草坪上的杂草
,我们就像一个园丁 为梦想做着修剪
,哪怕我会失败 哪怕我今天会特别丢脸
,我是一个普通人 有着不普通的梦
,我需要更努力地工作 别怕生活中的痛
,别人的不理解 只会成为自己的动力
,人生几十年 何不为了梦想去冲击
,You walk in line.
,Sometimes you almost lost your mind
,Do you keep your faith, my friend
,There's a chance to fight.
,可能很多人会觉得说唱很吵
,我觉得很好 因为任何人只要坚持就能搞
,很多人的眼里对于说唱歌手都有很多误会
,但你不知道我们曾经为了一个比赛存了很久路费
,那时候真的简单 享受着追梦的快乐
,到很远的地方就为了拿那么几分钟麦克
,然后我失败下台转身回家
,任何的比赛结果也不敢告诉我爸妈
,那时候只有一台录音机也没有电脑
,也不敢奢求说唱会让自己的生活变好
,我只是单纯地玩 单纯地做 单纯地说
,单纯地用这饶舌写下自己的生活
,慢慢的爱上了说唱 把麦克风拿在手上
,成为了自己弟弟妹妹心目中的偶像
,关于自己的态度不用太多话说
,即使失败我也会继续 谁叫我是他们大哥
,你是否觉得自己每天过得都很疲惫
,是否忘记你的梦想 觉得前程都已没了机会
,You walk in line,
,Sometimes you almost lost your mind.
,Do you keep your faith, my friend

,没有利益只有内心的和平
,也许十年之后我已经忘了HIPA
,那时候已经成为了孩子的爸
,只是为了自己的家庭做贡献
,而这青春的梦也很少梦见
,也许那时每天疲惫 寻找赚钱的机会
,不理会 那些所谓的烦恼
,只懂得埋头往前跑
,努力去对抗社会的煎熬
,那时候说唱和生活早已断了联系
,也许只有梦里才会出现曾经的旋律
,被惊醒 洗脸 让自己清醒
,脑中挥之不去的是曾经的声音
,那些年一起参加过的表演
,那些年经历的一次次考验
,站在舞台为了证明自己去表现
,都是我们为了音乐不顾一切的冒险

,和那些年一起经历的挫折和快乐
,别让自己的爱好变成回忆
,卸下疲惫的外套穿上棒球衣
,尝试 延续那早已不见的辉煌
,把麦克风紧握在手里试试能否继续唱
,这是一封写给我十年后的信
,在十年之后我是否为说唱还在拼
,那青春的梦是否已经淡忘
,只能在街边看着年轻人在弹唱
,都说为了说唱把青春浪费
,现在不后悔十年后也不会
,因为我们有梦 也追过
,我自豪的说青春我也曾挥霍
,也许会坠落 悬崖 我愿
,十年后也不想跳出这 音乐的火圈
,这条不归路也许我不是第一个
,我相信十年后他们都放弃我依然在做
,即使傻 也要傻出自己的特点
,对于说唱我不愿只看 他 的侧脸
,虽然玩到现在所谓的名气还是没有得到
,自己喜欢就好不求说唱给我回报

,板鞋穿上 他瞎逛 在大街小巷
,伴随着早上的日出内心变得好烫
,尽管算半个公众人物可他还是老样子
,在广场这老地址
,与homie约滑一波
,看他外转下两坎跳到空中用手拽板
,没站稳
,板飞出之后眼神叫homie快闪
,结果意料之中 他 被摔个四脚朝天
,笑声围绕在旁边
,自己也露出笑脸
,继续滑 踩一个尖翻 滑在homie先端
,偶然甩出一个小乱 街道被叫声掀翻
,把勇气鼓起像挣脱手指的气球浮起
,越高越易炸 为了自由足矣

,轻松突破投出 分数加二
,他求输 玩弄这几头猪
,无趣到把他愁哭
,当然这些画面都是来自他的幻想
,尽管他很菜 热爱使他保持站在战场
,不求赞赏 奋力的突破
,输过没哭过
,在球场摩擦头顶烈日汗水冲走了虚弱
,与伙伴配合把一切烦恼释放
,就算碰巧进球都笑得像个智障
,球不停在胯下运
,观察对手的眼睛像是放大镜
,尽管到了禁区常被火锅给喂饱
,不会选择狼狈 躲着或退倒

,让行人都成他们的舞蹈员
,是因为 他们的嘴巴长了眼睛
,被看到的一切都从嘴里吐露
,只有快乐充满内心接着更换舞步
,该赚的绝不放过也不受金钱管束
,宛如翻书般传递到他阐述
,他人无法管住自己的期待向内心缓入
,然后Dj drop the beat
,现场气氛逼他加着力
,好比设备爆音裤子肥大的90年
,但识乐中趣木头固然会有琴弦

,我的朋友
,我不想看见有一天你背叛我
,因为利益 因为自私
,因为这个时代本来就很冷漠
,所以你理所应当的
,消失在我的生活
,就这么他妈走了
,你不用跟我解释
,我比你更了解我们全都很软弱
,还没有人逼我们自己都交枪了
,但我更不想看见
,有一天我先把你们给忘掉
,跟过去说滚蛋
,我问你怎么样你才能快乐
,你指着电视里的那个成功的肚子
,笑脸
,你欢呼的告诉我
,那就是你的明天
,还有更多的孩子羡慕你追随你
,比你更加变本加厉的
,变成你要变成的你
,终于被超过
,变老然后超脱后悔
,曾经有种声音记得对你说过
,想再一次的听到
,只有一个办法
,闭上你的眼睛
,Close ur eyes close ur eyes you can see me
,Close ur eyes you can see me
,闭上你的眼睛
,让我发现你靠近
,你穿过你释放你
,现在你是自由的
,没有人能控制你
,你什么都不知道
,也什么都不需要
,当所有的一切
,在这一瞬间消失
,这不是一场梦
,是你短暂的一生
,黑色的白色的彩色
,的灰色的天空笼罩着紫禁城
,别说你看不见
,我们还在这儿站着
,黑暗中的光是我心中的火焰
,不停的烧
,直到你心无杂念
,让理解和宽容
,从新回到这个世界
,现在擦了你的眼泪
,回到梦中
,沉睡中发生的
,让我看不清这颜色
,这色既是空
,我无法再去形容
,所以闭上你的眼睛仔细听
,给看不见这世界的人一点魔力
,会为了游戏都不肯回去
,在这个世界里
,撞来撞去还不想放弃
,这出戏 都装着不在意
,欲望的光占多大的亮
,让我的影子
,把他挡上直到你投降
,要是没有一道光
,能让你不慌
,请你拽住脏的衣裳
,互相当个陪葬
,色彩与黑暗的差距
,又何必为了得到美丽而死去
,幸好可以回忆
,拉住我的手臂
,我可以在你黑色背景
,的梦里带你回去
,希望的乞讨
,痛苦的尖叫
,战争的号角
,一直在围绕
,闭上你的眼睛接着学会有礼貌
,想找到我们就需要拼命奔跑
,Close ur eyes
,Close ur eyes you can see me close ur eyes
,you can see me
,欲望在黑暗中食宿
,置一切于不顾
,灵魂深度
,中毒 嫉妒执迷不悟
,想要陈述正在忍受的痛楚
,解脱我们挣扎可也无路
,当你闭上你的双眼
,才能感受到
,内心真正的无助
,想要逃离挣脱这束缚
,充满灵魂却落入地狱深处
,在炼狱炼火中有声有时混入
,黑色白色这世间并无对错
,生活每天教会你新的一课
,现实本就残酷
,却放出诱人的烟雾
,有谁心中有数
,看出它真面目
,那是一道光急转我的心脏
,左手是迷茫
,右手是握不住的希望
,闭上眼睛把这一切都遗忘
,顺着光的指引去往该去的地方

春节回家看爸妈
词曲：钟应龙
主唱：钟应龙
推广：耀光文化


秋去冬来曾多少个轮回
独自一人漂泊在外却是如此狼狈
片片落叶它扶起了我的思念
传统的佳节就要到来

年迈的爸爸妈妈你们可好啊
天气凉了注意添些衣裳啊
问候少了你们请原谅吧
保重身体是孩儿的牵挂

无论我在海角天涯
带着我的希望一起回家
回到那个温暖的家
看看思念已久的爸和妈

今年春节回家看爸妈
多年没和你们唠唠家常话
多想吃你亲手包的那馅饺子
是多么的温暖和幸福

今年春节回家看爸妈
一家团团圆圆过大年
还有什么比这更留恋
外面生活何以再难言

,Been hiding in the darkness,
,Can't be healed by time
,Guess this house of mine
,Forever will be haunted
,I close my eyes
,But dare not sleep
,You made my dreams
,Like a ghost in the machine

,And every night has its day, so magical
,And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
,That can't be defeated
,For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
,In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
,For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
,With something to believe in

,Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
,I'll be waiting for love

,我以为为你准备惊喜会是一场浪漫
,也以为你是我做出的最得意的判断
,非常遗憾 这只是一场孤单的庆功宴
,寂寞的小鬼在我心底出现 它红了眼
,如果有一天我们联手战胜了时间蒙住双眼还能指认我是你一生的眷恋
,瞬间不必再亏欠
,感叹缘分的挂念
,幸好你及时的出现打破我所幻想的画面
,那画面不断在我脑海盘旋

,please dont take away love
,you know my willing heart
,就算我是个配角戏份再少
,也要努力陪你把这场戏演好
,要让观众都看到
,我才是你搭戏的男一
,你依旧是我的动力
,手握着你留下的信纸还残留你的香味几行字的解释让我不停回味也很想去追随伴你远走高飞
,可是我犯的错一次又一次情欲把我困在原地挣扎百次
,说了好几次的一生一世原来它只是一个生动的例子
,想说太多可是你已听不见我
,感情无法猜测
,但我每次还是猜错

,
,VERSE 3
,只想质问时间它是否还惦记我所有的珍惜 还会不断的争取把爱藏在心里跟它分个高低
,就算曾经的美好遗失找不到
,也不会像丢了玩具的孩子一样吵着要
,时间赶巧把所有的遗憾打包都带走
,拥挤的列车不会刻意不会刻意逗留在空洞的路口
,他们说我爱的卑微
,早就学会笨鸟先飞
,情的商店不再强迫消费
,但你还是我最大的软肋

,VERSE1：Clearuiv
,我害怕这孤独的环境
,就像孤军奋战的韩信
,我跳进这深深的陷阱
,孤独让我犯上了毒瘾
,曾经的我被当做玩具
,人们总会把我抛弃
,甚至没有一点珍惜
,也不觉得会很可惜
,无数流言四起
,不断向我射击
,听了太多对不起
,对不起真的爱你
,转头却和别人甜蜜
,不知道感情的真谛
,但你明白我不止想要当你的弟弟
,但是这些我早已忘记
,生活总该还要继续
,你的出现 不过是我
,人生中的 一个败笔
,成长总会受伤
,只要还有希望
,就当作全部都是上帝给你开好的一扇窗
,以前被残 忍打倒
,没有人将 我看好
,感谢所有留在我身边的人来给我依靠
,你们给我的力量就像是一万吨炸药
,把所有隐瞒和欺骗都给炸掉

,正在诉说着人心的麻痹
,玩hiphop 我付出了代价
,家人很生气 眼中带着杀气
,说我和其他人有着太多差异
,说唱玩起来就像杂技
,没办法出人头地
,笑了笑把帽子压低
,穿上oversize的卫衣
,云朵变得那么压抑
,身边充满潮湿空气
,我真的有点看不清晰
,说唱怎么变成全民公敌
,脏辫在妈妈眼里那么刺眼
,纹身受到了爸爸的指点
,我的生活我自己来主演
,想要的东西我自己实现
,回忆起前辈八一
,曾经也是生活的奴隶
,还有gosh的山鸡
,也曾搬砖当过苦力
,他们都在为理想努力
,我有什么理由放弃

,总有一天我会当上厂牌经理
,想说的太多了
,一首装不下
,我脚步太快了
,不会因此停下
,这天气太冷了
,已经接近零下
,化作烟火我做我自己的赢家

,打开我的iphon尾号49煲个电话粥
,翻开我们聊天记录发现时间有点多
,通话不间断 总是有话题说
,每次开玩笑 都会把自己玩脱
,每次都那么肯定 总是要独自拼命
,在电话这头的我给你下了最后命令
,让你好好争气 不要太过努力
,通过中国电信把我的爱远程传递
,慵懒气氛轻松 对你情有独钟
,复杂问题经过短短通话全部想通
,想要变成悟空 腾云飞过五中
,精准降落你的身边粗暴对你壁咚
,可能这 需要技巧 想我想 到了困恼
,请不要 太过计较 亲爱的 对你嘴唇亲咬
,味道太过清凉口感像是薄荷糖
,偷偷的在你作业本上画个提手旁

,喂 你好114 晓不晓得 花朵的电话号码
,麻烦你帮我打给她 好多话 想要对她说
,如果 我说如果 你换做我
,曰麻的终于看上一个姑娘 会不会为她写歌
,悄悄跟你说 那个妹崽不只是看起来有点cool
,可能我在玩火 要遭拒绝是不是很没面子
,可能别个会来笑话我
,哎兄弟伙 我又不是弟娃不会想那么多
,听不见声音看不见身影如何送她夜空中那最亮的星
,给我号码就是画龙点睛
,是不是太早不应该对她倾诉 可是我根本忍不住
,哪怕是碰壁 彩虹它来临之前都会下起雨
,好咯好咯 有没有查到花朵的电话
,加君还在等到起 已经给你
,讲老这样一个秘密 搞快点
,哦对咯 记到帮我保密哈

now you think I‘m cool
I didn’t change my taste like my soul
跳上了车
听我的歌
看新闻也在不停的播
艺术风格
主流决策
让别人帮自己去定夺
房门 反锁 大多数人不知道被拴上了枷锁
而我 可能就是下一个 被他们瞄准再开火
就像是秦朝他们不停征的税
艺术免税资格在他的眼里都不匹配
自由的创作还有教科书的错和对
说得好像我的文字能让正常人都跑去犯罪
Sorry
我只能唤醒本来就存在的东西
就像是毕加索描写这世界的问题
被叫做叛逆
我可能人头落地
我反对暴力
因为一切都不切实际
now you think I‘m cool
我开着布加迪
穿梭在雾霾里
看到工人被自己打造的城市
赶出去
这是个陷阱吧
比音乐还trap吧
记录事实的人被全国都在追捕吧
什么时候抗议的人被变成了狂徒
什么时候跳楼的学生变成他的错误
实在太残酷
我可能超速
被审查拦住
说我不准上路
蚍蜉不可能憾树
Xxxx
我只想知道所有真相
才能够一起奔向
那新的希望
但现在未来被谎言不断分赃
我可能有天会把自己亲手杀死埋葬
我看不清你指的方向
却知道敌人总赶着脏勾当
你也知道我们眼下的状况
只有自己才能教会我反抗
Wow
Show me the road
我现在就像是 在十字路口
是应该顶着风继续遨游 
乘风破浪 
准备战斗
Oh now you think I‘m cool
I didn’t change my taste like my soul

,规则我偶尔遵守 毕竟监管部门也是人
,bang bang bang bang 午夜传来了敲门
,并不是我打手枪 No No 没那么销魂
,yeah 这是一个局 属于我和我的兄弟
,我们的任务就是改变今晚这儿的空气
,改变东南西北 改变金木水火土
,改变光阴 改变青龙白虎朱雀玄武
,跟着我摇摆脑袋 任意地切换状态
,脚踩屋顶看一看那黄河之水天上来
,鱼水之交的买卖 摩拜飙到三百迈
,缺少治疗的外来反派 悄无声息将它们甩开
,看这鼓点 它是盆炭火 让年轻的人不停地跳
,忐忑无眠 乏时便看我 姑且一起无情地笑
,多情总被无情扰 你我不是深情的料
,唯独安大略上听潮 方能善恶分明并得道
,黯淡的光线 变成了雨点 滴穿了屋檐
,耗费数百年时间 仍未洞悉前庭后院

,老夫病肺怯清秋 楼角新蟾挂玉钩
,烹羊宰牛且为乐 芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲
,谁人七拼八凑 殊不知早就过了七言的年代
,浑然天成的笔墨是良驹 喂它以琼浆与燕麦
,我们点燃火焰 信手遣返昨天
,欲将键盘扩建 再将它简单缩减
,狂人眼看捉奸 右心房掀翻左边
,重工业延缓拖欠 终于能天蓝多年
,我等在街上行走 只靠胸口大写的狂
,无需那八面玲珑 只需左右一步穿墙
,管他想上位 上车 上天 乘氢气羽毛球
,但求不枉费 长城望远 看那平地起高楼
,心悸者心魔心中过 口吃者口拙口中出
,糖衣炮弹 糖衣脱落 糖衣化作耳边风
,不愿荣华富贵 更不愿貂皮门上挂
,但愿助罪人赎罪牛虻统统斩杀蚊帐下
,学海无涯 回头是岸 碧玉无瑕 如水至善
,假话不真 真话不假 唯智者功倍事半
,如我所说 这只是一个自带潮流的局
,你注定跟它流动 纵然我非子 而子非鱼
,无论喜马拉雅 吐鲁藏布 罗布泊 撒哈拉
,无论哪 总有天都会开出我们种的花
,无论哪 只要我们双眼尚能明辨浮夸

,离梦却渐行渐远 我快步的跟前
,海格洛夫庄园 那空荡的房间
,那花得鲜艳 却不如从前
,向往的有很多 但是 多少能实现
,遭遇过有很多 难事 还勇往直前
,还在忙碌的奔波 暂时 还不太值钱
,栽过那些跟头 依然历历在浮现
,看着那时钟停留在下分钟
,又反复的计算失败有多沉重
,很胆怯的望着那无尽的深空
,努力过的高度摔下一定很痛
,在哼着歌的等着我的我表示感谢
,有选择错的跟着和的留下是哽咽
,你什么都不懂 却也跟着他们嘲笑
,有恃还无恐 的背地里面逃掉
,背着罪的愧对谁的谁呢留下悔的泪了 洗面
,缩在龟壳扮演恶的说客抛弃美的罪责 祭奠
,试探着向前跟紧 时常都在紧绷的神经
,不断的摸索着担心又落魄了
,落下满是遗憾的曾经
,街角路边的灯影 照亮人生黑白的分镜
,琴弦也拨弄着做一个歌颂者
,上帝按响谁家的门铃
,谁没被背弃过
,好人留给谁去做
,眼神都发红了也发疯了
,真正为我留下的也没一个

,我把烟雾触笔散落地 我用天赋触语斩过去
,我将天上的雾霾都化作了云彩奇幻的满魔力
,太多的脆弱的虚弱的薄弱的柔弱的软弱的文弱书生
,依然在发出那呼天又号地的鬼哭又神嚎的沉落哭声
,看着他们真心痛 腔调都不分轻重
,看完那炫酷的炫目的炫富的歌曲都根筋痛
,如果走路都能带着风
,如果独处不会觉得空
,如果脚步蹒跚在那灯火阑珊的你不会觉得懵
,可是没有人能够满足
,都在划分自己的版图
,可是我只想当海格洛夫庄园内的碗橱

,不知道你现在在哪里
,过得好不好 有没有很开心
,从你的世界里面消失以后
,不知道有没有 曾经被想起
,记忆模糊了 画面消失了
,还能记得起的只有你的眼睛
,音乐响起了 阳光铺满了
,如今的我把这一切都唱给你听
,已经不记得那是怎样的一个晚上
,不知是小雨还是迷雾 风在耳边回荡
,我们都在怕分别的痛所以匆匆道别
,回到家门口还留着你忘记带走的拖鞋
,或早或晚的分别
,或冷或暖的季节
,写好的剧本又怎么可能会再次更迭
,没说出口的挽留
,看似坚强的回头
,倔强的我们终于在现实前低下了头
,这座城市里 记忆藏在每个角落
,yarra河边 流浪诗人见证了太多承诺
,珍惜眼前 能够在一起的每时每刻
,故事结局里 大多数人都会选择沉默
,也许我们本来就走在不同的路
,那偷来的时间本来也都不算数
,可无论结局怎样我都觉得庆幸
,感谢这一段有你陪伴在我的生命
,接下来抱歉无法再和你去一起经历
,但生活还有许多期待别把自己封闭
,All the best 送给你最后的一点希冀
,放手吧 勇敢向前别管是天堂或地狱
,忘记我但是请你记住我说过的话
,请为你自己而活 别活的那么伟大
,勇敢点大声说出你内心真实的想法
,如今的我们已经长大再也不会害怕
,每一次的离别都让我更加学会珍惜
,感谢你那时给的动力帮我度过最难时期
,时常想起与你一起玩的握手游戏
,抓到之后 你止不住的得意
,我想对于分别我应该是擅长的
,不停的你好再见我已经是淡然的
,每个人都有不同的生命轨迹
,兜兜转转 是否最后还停留在原地
,回忆像是一卷老旧的电影胶卷
,捕捉着每个微笑每次呼吸的瞬间
,那时的我们都在害怕每一天的结束
,好像明天到来后时间就会开始倒数
,还有着那么多的歌想给你听
,还有那么多的故事那么多的曾经
,留了那么多的泪从你的那么美的眼睛
,那时的我们都有着那么真的心
,嘿 不知道你最近过的好吗
,我只想跟你说 我很珍惜我们的回忆
,但一切都过去了
,我希望你可以过好之后的每一天
,All the best
,不知道你现在在哪里
,过得好不好 有没有很开心
,从你的世界里面消失以后
,不知道有没有 曾经被想起
,记忆模糊了 画面消失了
,还能记得起的只有你的眼睛
,音乐响起了 阳光铺满了
,如今的我把这一切都唱给你听
,每一个童话故事最后都会有个结尾
,但不是所有感情都能得到永恒的美
,对于发生的一切我从不后悔
,对于未来美好追逐我也从不气馁
,那么故事就在这里面画上句号
,挥一挥手 再送给你一个我的微笑
,希望未来的你可以一切都好
,希望未来的我也都可以做到

,

,
,但至少过程中感受过波澜不惊的水面和奔腾激流的凶险
,
,就算是不被人青睐 也不会被负面情绪给侵害
,
,调整好心态 疏通下筋脉 放下了包袱让步履更轻快

,Looking for every trace to your heart
,Wanna find where you were
,Who you are tonight
,I'm stranded in
,In a world full of dreams
,Out of time, out of luck, out of reach
,See the light, shining in
,From your eyes tonight
,
,The storm is coming now
,I'm your place to hide
,I think you're drowning now
,Running for your life
,We can slip away
,Into the dark
,Follow me follow me
,When there is no way out
,

,w/ Nicky Romero & Krewella - Legacy (Save My Life)
,Hearts on the run
,Wasted and young
,Every mistake stung
,'Til I was numb
,I almost didn't see you come
,
,When the walls around me were caving in
,You save my life tonight
,When there's nothing left but pouring rain
,You save my life tonight
,
,And I found my heart inside your hands
,You save my life tonight
,You showed me how to feel again
,You save my life tonight
,
,And we're just throw back to our older songs
,We wanna thank all of you for tuning it again
,2018’s gonna be a big year!
, And we can’t wait to share all of our new music with you
,See you then!
,You save my life tonight

,In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
,One to love, and one to lose
,Sweet divine, a heavy truth
,Water or wine, don't make me choose
,
,I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
,Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
,
,I've been running through the jungle
,I've been running with the wolves
,To get to you, to get to you
,I've been down the darkest alleys
,Saw the dark side of the moon
,To get to you, to get to you
,I've looked for love in every stranger
,Took too much to ease the anger
,All for you, yeah, all for you
,I've been running through the jungle
,I've been crying with the wolves
,To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
,

,Your fingertips trace my skin
,To places I have never been
,Blindly, I am following

,这一路上走走停停 顺着少年漂流的痕迹
,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打

,不知抚摸的是故事 还是段心情
,也许期待的不过是 与时间为敌
,再次看到你 微凉晨光里 笑的很甜蜜

,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍

,晚风吹起你鬓间的白发 抚平回忆留下的疤 你的眼中 明暗交杂 一笑生花
,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话
,我仍感叹于世界之大 也沉醉于儿时情话 不剩真假 不做挣扎 无谓笑话
,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了
,以爱之名 你还愿意吗

,北方的村庄住着一个南方的姑娘
,她总是喜欢穿着带花的裙子站在路旁
,她的话不多但笑起来是那么平静悠扬
,她柔弱的眼神里装的是什么 是思念的忧伤
,南方的小镇阴雨的冬天没有北方冷
,她不需要臃肿的棉衣去遮盖她似水的面容
,她在来去的街头留下影子芳香在回眸人的心头
,眨眼的时间芳香已飘散影子已不见
,南方姑娘 你是否习惯北方的秋凉
,南方姑娘 你是否喜欢北方人的直爽
,日子过的就像那些不眠的晚上
,她嚼着口香糖对墙满谈着理想
,南方姑娘 我们都在忍受着漫长
,南方姑娘 是不是高楼遮住了你的希望
,
,昨日的雨曾淋漓过她瘦弱的肩膀
,夜空的北斗也没有让她找到迷途的方向
,阳光里她在院子中央晾晒着衣裳
,在四季的风中她散着头发安慰着时光
,南方姑娘 你是否爱上了北方
,南方姑娘 你说今天你就要回到你的家乡
,思念让人心伤 她呼唤着你的泪光
,南方的果子已熟 那是最简单的理想

, 这是一首简单的小情歌
, 唱着人们心肠的曲折
, 我想我很快乐
, 当有你的温热
, 脚边的空气转了
, 这是一首简单的小情歌
, 唱着我们心头的白鸽
, 我想我很适合
, 当一个歌颂者
, 青春在风中飘着
, 你知道就算大雨让这座城市颠倒
, 我会给你怀抱
, 受不了看见你背影来到
, 写下我度秒如年难捱的离骚
, 就算整个世界被寂寞绑票
, 我也不会奔跑
, 逃不了最后谁也都苍老
, 写下我时间和琴声交错的城堡

,我时刻提醒自己我来自哪里
,该想的该做的该说的是否让自己满意
,是否也有过怀疑
,是否也有过抱怨
,整天埋头苦干得不到回报是否也会感到疲倦
,我是他们的英雄同样也是你的梦魇
,就像我克服了所有的困难让这些音符在我指尖上跳跃
,我依然做着不切实际的梦
,也把不可能撕开了一条缝
,井底之蛙咸鱼一条又怎样你都会想要用力的蹦
,在眼中倒影的景象是更加广阔的天空
,现在就撕开屏障或束缚跟我一起大闹天宫
,失败不过是回到起点重新再来一遍
,如果现在放弃 那就意味你已经失去一切
,失去了一切又怎样我还是要继续唱歌
,传奇的人生过程总是充满着坎坷
,用尽全力要不然你的人生哪里来的意义
,你的孩子你的hood如何流传关于你的事迹

,Ночь, видимо не догоняет нас.
,Просто останься без лишних фраз.
,Знаю, ты непокорима.
,Небо подскажет мне твое имя.
,Словно мотив от безумного джина.
,Твой перегар, аромат никотина.
,Я твой герой, ты - моя героиня.
,И ты мне нужна, ты - моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя мочь над небом парит.
,От любви меня не слышит.
,Обнимая мне говорит.
,Ты, любимый, мною дышишь.
,Отсюда надо валить.
,Отсюда надо валить.
,Не надо меня палить.
,Хватит меня хвалить.
,Знаешь, меня настигают.
,Часто любовь предлагают.
,Я теперь им че отвечаю.
,Ты, ты потревожила все мечты.
,Разогревая свои манты.
,Это не темная сила.
,Как ты красива, невыносимо.
,Словно мотив от безумного джина.
,Твой перегар, аромат никотина.
,Я твой герой, ты - моя героиня.

,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя малой малыш.
,С тобою моя жизнь.
,Заплетают дни, моя ты Мона Лиза.
,Ты греешь меня, как батарея.
,Когда зима на дворе, я.
,Чашки, ложки, все помыты.
,Взгляд, взгляд, а я как всегда, небритый.
,На меня смотри почаще, в этот ящик.
,И этот стиль тебя потащит.
,Накроет, как лавина, love витамины.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Love витамины, моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.
,Моя половина, моя половина.

,Если ты меня не любишь, то я тоже нет.
,Если ты меня забудешь, то и я в ответ.
,С тобой не могу найти контроль
,Теперь домой я отправлю свою любовь трезветь,
,Не стоит, это слухи, я не такой, не верь,
,Но порой эти суки ломятся в дверь ко мне.
,Но как ты могла? Но как ты могла
,Раздеть все наши чувства догола?
,Говори другому всё те же слова
,Бла-бла-бла.
,Но я же знаю, что ты без меня
,Не хочешь, хочешь, хочешь, хочешь,
,А с тобою нам быть нельзя
,И будет эта песня для тебя
,Если ты меня не любишь, то я тоже нет.
,Если ты меня забудешь, то и я в ответ.
,Если ты меня не любишь, то я тоже нет.
,Если ты меня забудешь, то и я в ответ.
,Поцелую долго, долго
,Дальше можно всё забыть.
,Колол меня иголкой.
,Не оставляй правой.
,Нить теперь,
,Как небо, небо, небо, небо.
,Смотрю в глаза их не я любила ночью,
,А кто-то за меня.
,Если я в чужих руках
,Помни, что ты сказал тогда.
,Лучше ты не прощай, стучит в висках,
,Но я же знаю, что ты без меня
,Не хочешь, хочешь, хочешь, хочешь,
,А с тобою нам быть нельзя

,I let it fall, my heart
,And as it fell, you rose to claim it
,It was dark and I was over
,Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
,My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak
,To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
,But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
,All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
,And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
,But I set fire to the rain
,Watched it pour as I touched your face
,Well, it burned while I cried
,'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
,I set fire to the rain
,And I threw us into the flames
,When we fell, something died
,'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
,Cursing me boy you played through my mind like a symphony
,There's no way to describe what you do to me
,You just do to me what you do
,And it feels like I've been rescued
,I've been set free
,I am hyptonized by your destiny
,You are magical,lyrical,beautiful
,You are and I want you to know baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat
,I set fire to the rain
,And I threw us into the flames
,When we fell, something died
,'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
,Sometimes I wake up (No one can pause)by the door
,(You stand alone to every record I own)
,That heart you caught must be waiting for you
,Even now when we're already over(Music to my hear )
,I can't help myself from looking for you(that's what you are ,a song that goes on and on)
,I set fire to the rain(I I love you like a love song baby)
,Watched it pour as I touch your face(I I love you like a love song baby)
,Well, it burned while I cried(I I love you like a love song baby)
,'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name(And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat)
,Let it burn(I I love you like a love song baby)
,oh..I I love you like a love song baby
,baby..I I love you like a love song baby

,I thought I found a love but she was just a fling.
,And then I'm a girl,
,and felt a different thing.
,It's like your hit in the ring like you're pulled by a string.
,Can't breathe like you're choking on a chicken wing.
,It was a thing called a zing.
,And I wanted to sing,
,and listen to the ballads of a man named Sting.
,Baby, looks in your eye.
,And it's suddenly spring like when Nala kissed Simba in the lion king.
,Zinging in the air and I don't have a care.
,I'm winging from the zing that we share.
,Zinging in the rain.
,Now I'm feeling no pain.
,It's real, time for celebrating cause you're my zing.
,（Drag, ready to throw down?
,No,
,no I just came closer to hear you better.
,Oh, come on!
,Just give it a try.
,Alright.
,Maybe just a little bit）.
, So listen all you zingers from here on
,cause if love was money,
,You better grab a box of strings and get ready to cling
,you'd better be yelling "cha - ching",
,cause next to zing,
,cupid's arrow's a little bee sting,
,it was a zing and a zang and a ziygididy and there was one only one
,lady in the zing for me cause when you zing （when you zing）!
,You better know one little thing: the only thing you're gonnna sling is a wedding ring!
,Zinging in the air.
,Now I don't have a care.
,I'm winging from the zing that we share.
,Zinging in the rain.
,Now I'm feeling no pain.
,It's a real time for celebrating cause you're my zing.
,To the zing y'all, ba-da-bing y'all.
,Gonnna knock you out right outta that ring y'all.
,Better ring y'all, happening y'all.
,Pay attention to the undead king, y'all!
,Oh!
,Oh!
,Its been a while since the last time that weve seen each other
,Got me thinking bout that time when we were together
,You used to make me laugh, with a silly act
,With your funny voice and that small koala nose of yours
,I guess good things werent meant to last
,Because you were by my side
,But now its just all in the past
,Was more than just love and trust
,All the things that stood between us
,I guess youd agree were better off how we are now
,But when you tell me all the terrible things
,That are happening in your life
,Something feels weird and its hurting me deep inside
,And it cuts me like a knife
,
,You dont deserve all the things youre going through
,And the more you cry, the more Im dying deep down inside
,Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat
,Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat

毕竟我们深爱过 
有你陪的日子里 
我真的好快乐 
你总是小心翼翼的 
因为你怕我难过
而我却不能给你
给你想要的结果
一万个舍不得 
不能回到从前了 
爱你没有后悔过 
只是应该结束了 
一万个舍不得 
我是永远爱你的
爱你我觉得值得 
只是不能再爱了
不要追问对与错

分开了 不代表不爱你了

,I woke up pissed off today
,And lately everyone feels fake
,Somewhere I lost a piece of me
,Smoking cigarettes on balconies
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,Last year took a toll on me
,But I made it with you next to me
,Around the world and back again
,I hope you're waiting at the end
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,I'll be loud for you
,I got you I promise
,Let me be honest
,Love is a road that goes both ways
,When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But I'm holding on to something
,Wake up if you feel nothing
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,There was a time that I was sober
,What I got to do to show you
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,So I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too

,I wish somebody would have told me that
,Some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of these good old days
,I was thinking about the band
,I was thinking about the fans
,We were underground
,Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
,In a small club in Minnesota
,And the snow outside of 1st Ave
,I just wanted my name in a star
,Now look at where we at
,Still growing up
,Still growing up
,I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
,Couldn't wait to get older
,Couldn't wait to be someone
,Now that I'm here
,Wishing I was still young
,Those good old days
,I wish somebody would have told me that
,That some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of the good old days
,Wish I didn't think I had the answers
,Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first
,Wish I made it to homecoming
,Got up the courage to ask her
,Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
,Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
,Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
,And felt comfortable in myself
,Rooftop open
,And the stars above
,Moment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love
,Me, you and that futon
,We'd just begun
,On the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was
,Those good old days
,I wish somebody would have told me that
,That some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of the good old days
,Never thought we'd get old
,Maybe we're still young
,May we always look back
,And think it was better than it was
,Maybe these are the moments
,Maybe I've been missing what it's about
,Been scared of the future
,Thinking about the past
,While missing out on now
,We've come so far
,I guess I'm proud
,And I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile
,I've got some scars
,I've been around
,I've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
,Those good old days
,You don't know
,What you've got
,Till it goes
,Till it's gone
,You don't know
,What you've got
,Till it goes
,Till it's gone

,绿叶在跟随
,放开刺痛的滋味
,今后不再怕天明

,我怕一天一天被摧毁

,Осталась бы навечно!

,Малиновый день подходит к концу,
,Амы с тобой здесь, в Малиновом лесу
,Поем Малиновые песни
,Под бледным мерцанием Малиновых созвездий.
,Малиновый цвет моих отважных брюк
,Как солнце освещает все вокруг,
,Я погружаюсь в ритмы танца
,И нечего пытаться, метаться,
,Тут некуда деваться!
,Гляди туда, где закат такой Малиновый,
,Ты видел его дома лишь на половину.
,Он будет тебе напоминать по утрам
,Тот Малиновый вечер,
,Тот Малиновый рай,
,Тот праздник,
,Который мы с тобою здесь отметили.
,И что нет Малиновей его на белом свете.
,Эй, диск-жокей, заряжай пластинки!
,Авария идет в Малинки!

,Сколько людей! Малиновых и разных.
,Сюда пришел сам Малиновый Босс,
,Готовый решить любой Малиновый вопрос.
,Он рад друзьям,
,Потому что это здорово,
,Когда все здесь, по эту сторону забора.
,Он идет - и несется следом:
,"Вот он, король - Малиновое Лето!"
,Он такой же как мы, не высок он и не короток,
,Он утром выходит на Малиновые корты.
,Он жмет на газ. Он не любит тормоза,
,И светится улыбка в малиновых глазах.
,Он гитару берет - можно заслушаться.
,Он нам споет сегодня, если получится.
,Он знает такое! Только держись!
,Даешь всем Малиновую жизнь!
,Малинки, Малинки,

,Делай все так, как мы договаривались.
,Здесь то ли мы, то ли он, то ли я,
,Здесь ждет тебя страна Малиния.
,Время в дороге проходит незаметно.
,
,А можно за руль сесть - надавить педаль,
,Глядя обоими глазами в Малиновую даль.
,Здесь есть ландыши, тюльпаны, незабудки.
,Здесь ходят девушки - Малиновые губки,
,Здесь такой озон, здесь такой музон,
,Здесь то ли ты, то ли я, то ли он.
,Плюнь на ладонь, погладь Малиновые волосы
,Здесь тебя ждет незабываемая молодость,
,Здесь то ли мы, то ли он, то ли я,
,Здесь ждет тебя страна Малиния.

,You'd like to meet to go over
,They say that time's supposed to heal ya
,But I ain't done much healing
,Hello

,before the world fell at our feet
,There's such a difference between us
,And a million miles
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,that I've done
,But when I call you
,never seem to be home
,to tell you
,Hello how are you
,It's so typical of me
,to talk about myself
,I'm sorry
,I hope
,that you're well
,Did you ever make it out of that town
,Where nothing ever happened
,It's no secret
,That the both of us
,are running out of time
,So hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,that I've done
,But when I call you never
,seem to be home to tell you
,Hello from the outside
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,But when I call you never
,seem to be home
,Hello from the outside
,At least I can say
,that I've tried
,to tell you I'm sorry
,for breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

,Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
,Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
,But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
,Holdin' him for ransom, some
,Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
,Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
,I see nothing better, I keep him forever
,Like a vendetta-ta

,Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
,Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
,But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
,We'll move to an island, and
,And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
,Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
,I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
,Never be the same now, now
,I, I, I see how this is gon' go
,Touch me and you'll never be alone

,In the V.I.P.
,It＇s a new day, and if you ever knew Dre,
,Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre.
,Same Impala, different spokes
,Same chronic, just a different smoke.
,（If I could fit the whole hood in the club）
,Hop in the low-rider, long as it got bitches in the back,
,（I turn it into a strip-club）
,Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo＇ bounce that ass,

,Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon
,I promised I would never stop and in your name I would climb them
,There's nothing I have wanted more
,The only one I've been waiting for
,So hold your breath and close your eyes
,The end is unknown but still we rise
,Counting down to the light
,Through the night

,Sleepless nights have paved my way and this road is finally ending
,I've killed for just the chance to be in this place where now I'm standing
,The fear is creeping up behind all this courage I am projecting
,I can't find order in my mind, but this noise inside so deafening
,It's only one more day
,It's only one more day

,Guided by a beating heart
,I can't tell where the journey will end
,But I know where to start
,They tell me I'm too young to understand
,They say I'm caught up in a dream
,Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
,Well that's fine by me
,So wake me up when it's all over
,When I'm wiser and I'm older
,All this time I was finding myself
,And I didn't know I was lost
,So wake me up when it's all over
,When I'm wiser and I'm older
,All this time I was finding myself

,I tried carrying the weight of the world
,But I only have two hands
,Hope I get the chance to travel the world
,But I don't have any plans
,Wish that I could stay forever this young
,Not afraid to close my eyes
,Life's a game made for everyone
,And love is the prize
,So wake me up when it's all over

, Was it not enough for you?
,
, So many nights we spent together
, Different point of view was building our love
, Now our feelings are so real like imitation leather
, How will I find myself if you will take my heart away
, Never in life, I know it's the same
, Forget about your promise just let it be this way
, You get this over I've got to run away
, You were love of my life
, Ain't I supposed to be with you?
, You were my angel, my sky
, It was not enough for you!

, And I supposed to be with you?

, You were love of my life
, The great sacrifice
, Finally has burned out and
, Now my heart is cold as ice

,谁也绝不过你　和你斗早心死
,那最多可笑可怕也未算可悲
,逢场作戏　当看杂技
,到现在还是很佩服你
,幸福送到嘴边　亦硬生生放弃
,
,为了救急　做梦都想起相识得到什么
,决记不起我性格太易难过
,既已知道是自助　拿我所需的路过
,我没有旁人要得多　才能临危熄火
,旁人大闹抗议　我却静坐
,谁知起因　却记后果
,但最不开心的　不会是我
,
,难过极了　要笑  自我贬低缩小
,细到一粒细沙的痛又有多少
,来回对照　哪有预兆
,算命但结果不再重要
,值得要叫我开心  为什么不丧笑

Woke up today in casts of blue
And helplessly pretending
We'll get better over time
Quit bars and chains, the road anew
I got away still under you

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Oh oh oh

Fell on the way to getting through
Collect the days of bad things, so it's better all the time
I never notice shades and hues
Always the same still under you

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
If you could please promise them to me

Oh oh oh

So please don't make more promises to me
And please don't take everything from me
And I will breathe in every word you mean
Somebody said you've been looking at me all night, yeah
So I looked back 'cause I liked what I saw, alright, yeah
Did you come here to party, 'cause I came to get naughty
I really hope we gonna do the same things tonight
I wanna dance with you
I wanna dance with you
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna party like we're animals
I wanna party like we're animals
Come on let's party like we're animals
I wanna party like we're animals (animals animals animals animals animals )
Move Your feet

,
,For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
,In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
,For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
,With something to believe in
,
,Monday left me broken
,Tuesday I was through with hoping
,Wednesday my empty arms were open
,Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
,Bang the stars it's Friday
,I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
,Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
,I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
,To cover on

,Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
,I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m okay
,Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
,But I hope I never see them again
,I know it breaks your heart
,Moved to the city in a broke down car
,And four years, no calls
,Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
,And I can't stop, no, I can’t stop
,
,So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
,That I know you can't afford
,Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
,Pull the sheets right off the corner
,Of the mattress that you stole
,From your roommate back in Boulder
,We ain't ever getting older
,
,You look as good as the day I met you
,I forget just why I left you, I was insane
,Stay and play that Blink-182 song
,That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
,I know it breaks your heart
,Moved to the city in a broke down car
,And four years, no calls
,Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
,And I can't stop
,No, I can't stop

,忘记 未曾到过的世界
,那么难 心早已飘了不知有多远
,你让我丢掉那些 不切实际的 梦想
,你看着我的脸 我听不见
,窝在 汽车后座的窗前
,眼皮上 晃动着倾泻下来的光线
,灿烂透明的阳光 刺痛了我的 双眼
,那心跳的感觉 就像看到他的脸
,你问我 到底偷偷揣着 什么秘密
,我唯一的秘密 就是不能告诉你
,当有一天 你看到我站在谁的 身边
,我笑的最无邪 你就全了解
,我要 和他一起踏上的旅程
,是你 绝对想象不到的大冒险
,当樱花纷飞在眼前
,雨点打落在海边的草原
,我会寄给你一张印着我们笑容的明信片
,我愿意每天照顾好院子里面的花
,只为看到他脸上 一扫而光的疲倦
,我知道 这一切不知延续到哪天
,可是拥有过这些 就足以感谢

,You're a 1000 miles away my dear
,But my sweater smells like your perfume
,I'm lost on Mulholland Drive
,But I swear to God I'm still with you
,I can't take when you're away from home
,You know this bed was made for two
,Just bought a ticket to L.A.
,I wanna sleep amongst the stars with you
,Oooh, they say we're young, wild and stupid
,But now we're Malibu cruising
,And though the distance left bruises
,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,I don't care if the going gets hard
,I don't care if we sleep in our car
,It's no matter the issue
,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,The space between us is gone
,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,It's all become reality
,I've been praying that this day would come
,You've been working with no pay
,And I've been working until my hands go numb
,I'm glad that you had faith in me
,My darling girl just look how far we've come
,We got a chance to change our destiny
,I thing our stories just begun
,Oooh, they say we're young, wild and stupid
,But now we're Malibu cruising
,And though the distance left bruises
,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,The space between us is gone
,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,I don't care if the going gets hard
,I don't care if we sleep in our car

,I can finally hold you
,The space between us is gone
,It's gone,baby
,I need you close to me
,I need you close to me
,Don't need no space from you, baby
,
,Don't let this be our final song
,Don't let this be our final song
,Don't let this be our final song
,Please, won't you wait? Won't you stay?
,At least until the sun goes down
,When you're gone, I lose faith
,I lose everything I have found
,Heart strings, violins
,That's what I hear when you're by my side
,Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side
,
,And when you're gone the music goes
,I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
,So hear me out before you say the night is over
,I want you to know that we gotta, gotta carry on
,So don't let this be our final song

,
,Baby when we were young
,There was nothing to make believe
,And the songs that we sang
,They were written for you and me
,Melodies on repeat
,That's what I hear when you're by my side
,Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side
,And when you're gone the music goes
,I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
,So hear me out before you say the night is over

,
,Woo-ooo, take us to a higher ground
,Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
,Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright
,We could make the perfect sound
,And when you're gone the music goes
,I lose my rhythm, lose my soul

,Hello, it's me
,I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
,To go over everything
,They say that time's supposed to heal ya but I ain't done much healing
,Hello, can you hear me
,I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
,When we were younger and free
,I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
,There's such a difference between us
,And a million miles
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times to tell you
,I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
,But when I call you never seem to be home(to tell you)
,
,Hello, how are you
,It's so typical of me to talk about myself
,I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
,Did you ever make it out of that town
,Where nothing ever happened
,It's no secret
,That the both of us are running out of time
,Hello from the other side

,And it feels like yesterday
,Live like tomorrow never comes
,We chased the sun

,We could be wrong,we could be right

On Jubilee street there was a girl named Bee
She had a history, but no past
When they shut her down the Russians moved in
Now I am to scared to even walk on past

She used to say:
All those good people down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Here they are to practice what they preach
Those good people on Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I’m pushing my own wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain
And I’m pushing my wheel of love on Jubilee Streets
I look at them now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to ṗractice what I preach
These days I go downtown in my tie and tails
I got a foetus on the leash

I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
Curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I’m transforming, I’m vibrating, I’m glowing
I’m flying, look at me
I’m flying, look at me now

やっと眼を覚ましたかい それなのになぜ眼も合わせやしないんだい？
终于醒来了吗 为何不与我对视呢？
「遅いよ」と怒る君 これでもやれるだけ飛ばしてきたんだよ
你生气的责备我“来的太迟啦” 可这已经是我耗尽全力飞来你身边的速度了
心が身体を追い越してきたんだよ
我的心甚至蹦出了身体 早早地来到了这儿
君の髪や瞳だけで胸が痛いよ
仅仅是看着你的发梢和眼眸胸口就隐隐作痛
同じ時を吸いこんで離したくないよ
想要和你生活在同一个时空 再也不要分开
遥か昔から知る その声に
听见那个从遥远过去就烂熟于心的声音
生まれてはじめて 何を言えばいい？
有生以来的第一次 我该回应些什么呢
君の前前前世から僕は 君を探しはじめたよ
从你的前前前世开始 我就在寻找着你
そのぶきっちょな笑い方をめがけて やってきたんだよ
追逐着你笨拙的笑容 总算抵达至今
君が全然全部なくなって チリヂリになったって
就算你消失不见 散落成一片一片
もう迷わない また１から探しはじめるさ
我也会又一次拼凑这些碎片 不会再迷茫哦
むしろ０から また宇宙をはじめてみようか
换句话说就如此从零开始制造一个宇宙看看吧
君の前前前世から僕は 君を探しはじめたよ
从你的前前前世开始 我就在寻找着你哦
そのぶきっちょな笑い方をめがけて やってきたんだよ
追逐着你笨拙的笑容 总算抵达至今
君が全然全部なくなって チリヂリになったって
就算你消失不见 散落成碎片
もう迷わない また１から探しはじめるさ
我也会又一次拼凑碎片 不会再迷茫哦
何光年でも この歌を口ずさみながら
不管要跨越多少光年 我都会哼着这首歌 再度找到你

,I’m changing all of the stations

,We drew a map to a better place
,But on that road I took a fall
,Oh baby why did you run away
,I was there for you in your darkest times
,I was there for you in your darkest nights
,But I wonder where were you when I was at my worst down on my knees
,And you said you had my back so I wonder where were you
,When all the roads you took came back to me
,So I’m following the map that leads to you

,Hard to resist temptation
,Cause something strange has come over me
,And now I can’t get over you
,No I just can’t get over you
,I was there for you
,In your darkest times
,I was there for you in your darkest times

,…I am sitting  din din din……
,I am sitting in the morning
,At the diner on the corner
,I am waiting at the counter
,For the man to pour the coffee
,And he fills it only halfway
,And before I even argue
,He is looking out the window
,At somebody Coming in
,
,"It is always nice to see you"
,Says the man behind the counter
,To the woman who has come in
,She is shaking her umbrella
,And I look the other way
,As they are kissing their hellos
,I'm pretending not to see them
,Instead I pour the milk
,
,I open up the paper
,There's a story of an actor
,Who had died while he was drinking
,It was no one I had heard of
,And I'm turning to the horoscope
,And looking for the funnies
,When I'm feeling someone watching me
,And so I raise my head
,Da da da le da da da le……

,Alone, I'm searching for devotion, in the faded melody
,My soul is trying to cross an ocean, down on bended knee
,Lock up my condense and rhyme, don't know what I'm trying to say
,(My heart) all the time was stolen, by bad poetry
,Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
,And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
,Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
,And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
,I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open, love's insanity
,So long words are left unspoken, couldn't set them free
,Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
,(My heart) I'm left with a broken vocabulary
,Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
,And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
,Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
,And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
,Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
,And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
,Don't you think it's perfect and the feeling's worth it
,When we're getting down down down down down
,Everything you've searched for is right here on the dance floor
,And you want it now now now now now
,Don't know what you're there for
,Bring it over here in the middle of the crowd inside my sound
,Seeing through your eyelids
,I know you like it when the music gets loud
,
,I never, I never want another
,Come back, come back to me, my lover
,I never, I never want another
,Bring back, bring back, bring back the summer
,Bring back the summer
,Touch the stars,  the stars,  the stars
,Touch the stars,  the stars,  the stars
,
,Ba-ba-baby, we can get hot, maybe it's a long shot
,We should throw it back right now now now
,And in a little while I see you start to smile
,And here you thought you forgot that you knew how
,Baby, I can't help it
,Nobody else can burn me up like you've got me up in flames
,From our very first kiss to our very last wish
,You'll be running through my veins
,
,I never, I never want another
,Come back, come back to me, my lover
,Take a chance, and touch the stars
,Start to dance to the beat of your heart
,Take a chance, you've come this far
,Lift up your hands, and touch the stars

,爱的是非对错已太多
,来到眉飞色舞的场合
,混合他的冲动她的寂寞不计较后果
,理由一百万个有漏洞
,快说破说破以后最赤裸
,事后爱不爱我理不理我关系着结果
,你说我要结果
,中间不必停留
,你说我要一转头再过来
,男的女的都不要再等候
,自由自由现在就要自由

,深夜里的脚步声
,总是刺耳
,害怕寂寞
,就让狂欢的城市陪我关灯
,只是哪怕周围再多人
,感觉还是一个人
,每当我笑了
,心却狠狠地哭着
,给我一个理由忘记

,你出现在我诗的每一页
,雨下整夜我的爱溢出就像雨水
,窗台蝴蝶像诗里纷飞的美丽章节
,我接着写把永远爱你写进诗的结尾
,你是我唯一想要的了解
,那饱满的稻穗幸福了这个季节
,而你的脸颊像田里熟透的蕃茄
,你突然对我说七里香的名字很美
,我此刻却只想亲吻你倔强的嘴
,整夜我的爱溢出就像雨水
,这夜里 路上行人好拥挤
,停在原地 不知如何走下去
,紧紧拥抱的你 深深爱的言语
,像电影散场 一幕幕分离
,陷落在最心底 沸腾不已
,夜夜 惊醒在空荡的梦里
,失去你失去勇气 失去意义
,谁记得分手那天 还下着雨
,曾经 做了约定说不放弃
,傻得可以 不留余地
,寂寞只剩自己 身不由己
,夜夜 惊醒在空荡的梦里
,失去你失去勇气 失去意义

,就算早知道结局 也许我仍会选择和你的命中注定
,明明 爱情本来就不公平
,只见新人笑的那些熟悉场景
,独留我伤情伤心 伤到最彻底
,一生也许再也没有也许
,何时纠结 会过去
,我丢了我自己 身不由己
,下雨天了怎么办 我好想你
,不敢打给你 我找不到原因

,怎样的我能让你更想念
,雨要多大
,天要多黑 才能够有你的体贴
,其实 没有我你分不清那些

,这一个轮回
,我知道再也不能心如止水
,爱情的心事
,幸福而憔悴
,有几人能逃过这大喜大悲
,长天和秋水
,明媚的花蕊
,连擦肩而过都像一场宿醉
,你一颦一笑
,荡漾几多回
,整个世界都被你占领心扉
,哦 你就这样来了
,盗心的贼
,突然袭来就让我没有防备
,我的心被你掏了无怨无悔
,谁能够体会
,哦你就这样来了
,盗心的贼
,我的一腔热血就化作眼泪
,不要在让我悲伤
,如痴如醉
,再爱一回

抒情的音乐不是我的Style 
有时很狂野 有时很可爱
这个节拍 第一个我醒过来
灯光的旋转越来越快 我不想太快
可你为什么还不来跟着我的舞台
别藏在角落里发呆 这一幕更精彩
和我一起摇摆 和我一起摇摆
这烦恼和不安 全部都甩开甩开
和我一起摇摆 和我一起摇摆
什么都不用去想 这感觉最痛快
抒情的音乐不是我的Style

 当山峰没有棱角的时候 
 当河水不再流
 当时间停住 日夜不分 
 当天地万物化为虚有
 我还是不能和你分手 
 不能和你分手
 你的温柔是我今生最大的守候
 当太阳不再上升的时候 
 当地球不再转动
 当春夏秋冬 不再变化 
 当花草树木全部凋残
 我还是不能和你分散 
 不能和你分散
 你的笑容是我今生最大的眷恋
 让我们红尘作伴 活的潇潇洒洒
 策马奔腾 共享人世繁华
 对酒当歌唱出心中喜悦
 轰轰烈烈把握青春年华 
 让我们红尘作伴 活的潇潇洒洒
 策马奔腾 共享人世繁华
 对酒当歌唱出心中喜悦
 轰轰烈烈把握青春年华

你有一颗美丽的心，
大又圆的眼睛，
做每一件事 都专注的表情，
我的一切你都好奇，
不好的记性，
但怎么我的生日总是由你提醒，
放空的脑袋 动不动就出神，
常常都会忘记带钱出门，
路也不认得 说话很小声，
没有一点伪装 有点天真，
我的上辈子 好事一定做很多，
能把你拥有 就好像在做梦，
虽然你很会拖 化妆要一个钟头，
还会突然出现在我的左右，
你每天都可爱 常常很温柔，
总是拿没有常识的问题问我，
也总搞不懂电脑该怎么用，
但这些都是我爱着你的理由，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你的一点两点三点，
你的每一点，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你昨天今天明天，
你的每一天，
你有着不整齐的牙齿，
但可爱的微笑，
不匀称的身材 但有自己的STYLE，
你耳根子后的味道，
跳舞时同手同脚，
晚餐为我准备巧克力蛋糕和冷冻水饺，
就是爱你的莫名其妙，
独树一格的幽默 从不娇柔做作，
陪我跟兄弟们搅和，
生存游戏 电动玩具 撞球 篮球，
所有男生的把戏，
你都可以跟我一起，
你对朋友讲义气，
不讲理的孩子气，
偶然的温柔 发火的威力，
你喝醉时的脸颊，
帮我挤粉刺 帮我剪脚指甲，
你的任性和韧性 乐观的个性，
不管你信或不信，
这辈子只想与你相依为命，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你的一点两点三点，
你的每一点，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你昨天今天明天，
你的每一天，
爱陪你哭 又爱逗你笑，
爱跟你斗嘴，
我说去哪你都耍脾气说不要，
爱你在偷笑 却说我很难笑，
爱你为我煮饭，
虽然 你总是烧焦，
爱你总会收藏看过的电影票，
总在吵架以后才会对我撒娇，
爱跟你抢遥控器，
爱你问的笨问题，
爱你为了我穿上蕾丝睡衣，
爱你对我很在意，
常常吃醋都不腻，
我们同时说出一句话的默契，
爱看你生气不说话的表情，
爱听你半夜讲电话快睡着的声音，
坐上我的机车吹风淋雨从没抱怨，
陪我吃个路边摊只为了省钱，
谢谢你很善变，
谢谢你爱我的大脸，
还有爱我数不清的缺点，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你的一点两点三点，
你的每一点，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你昨天今天明天，
你的每一天，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你的一点两点三点，
你的每一点，
爱上你的优点，
爱上你的缺点，
爱你昨天今天明天，
你的每一天。

,Waiting for your knock on the door
,You'll be on your way, on your way to my place, boy
,Never get enough, I don't know how
,All I need, all I need is your touch
,When the new moon falling tonight
,From the sky, you won't stop calling
,And my name is your anthem
,Baby you make me p-purr like a panther
,
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,All I, all I want is to get down
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,With nobody, but your body
,
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,All I, all I want is to get down
,One on one
,I wanna, wanna get down
,With nobody, but your body
,(With nobody, but your body)
,
,(With nobody, but your body)
,
,(With nobody, but your body)
,And I really want you
,I really want you, want you, baby
,And I really want you
,I really want you, baby
,
,And I really want you
,I really want you, baby
,Tell me what you gonna do
,And I really want you, want you
,
,Like you wander out in the dark
,I will steal your heart like a bandit
,You ain't gotta get away
,You ain't gotta get away
,When the new moon falling tonight
,From the sky, you won't stop calling
,And my name is your anthem
,Baby you make me p-purr like a panther
,
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,All I, all I want is to get down
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,With nobody, but your body
,
,One on one
,I'm a-looking for a big fun
,All I, all I want is to get down
,One on one
,I wanna, wanna get down
,With nobody, but your body
,(With nobody, but your body)
,
,With nobody, but your body
,
,With nobody, but your body
,
,They said he wasn’t real
,They said he wouldn’t come back
,But this isn’t a dream
,And there’s no running from the spook
,
,Don’t be scared
,
,Spook
,
,Come little children I’ll take you away
,Into a land of enchantment
,Come little children the times come to play
,Here in my garden of magic
,
,Don’t be scared
,
,Spook

我梦见我在食物链的顶端吃饼干
我还梦见我在灵山云端看景观
来一场大自然意外让你的三观彻底崩溃 
奇怪的东西不再奇怪七宗罪也不再是罪
无止尽的黑暗中的深渊里的纠结
恰似那化不去的初冬里的秋雪
无所谓那廉价的虚伪的仁义道德的优越
我只为那未知的最终的不清不明的修业
你根本都看不到我的灵魂啷个出体 
穿越宇宙我说我要逃离这片土地

,说在外挣钱却也没有为他们买礼物

,看见老爸写字的那只手一直在抖
,我甚至都不记得他们生日真是不孝
,看着花白的头发才知道时间真是毒药

,现在却各奔东西很难再重聚
,有一个爱的姑娘待在你的身边
,现在想再遇到爱的很不容易

,随着时间在走身边的人也在变
,靠他人不如靠己 请咬牙坚持到底
,和曾经不懂事的自己说声再见

它们之间有爱有恨形成了我的灵魂
世间万物存在有理都是为了平衡
无论富裕贫困你都逃不出痛苦的永恒

三分米 七分沙 只怪生在寻常百姓家
学的是仁义礼智信 求的是四季平安福
吃的是金木水火土 怕的是生老病死苦
当读书娃儿的时候从来都不得上早自习
ABCD随意选的态度来面对考试题
立誓一定要撬翻那些不落教的老势力

老子不想跟你说话崽儿生了病没吃药哈
早就已经习惯了牛头马面在白天活动
所以现在晚上我也不会再做噩梦
那些理想主义的牢骚老子没得耐心再听
当了嫩个多年 中国人 你装个锤子外宾
要不要戴上面具一起说着制度化的谎言，
昧着良心还是心安理得地领取魔鬼的赏钱
我不在乎变好变坏 我的风格自成一派 
杀不死我的东西都会让我变得更加奇怪
我才不跟他们 比哪个冰冷比哪个心狠
天上飞翔的精神是洞悉精准 我与月亮亲吻
反正都是嫩个回事 说多了都是锤子
这个社会最不缺的就是讲童话的媒子
要是再挨你一下 我儿不是要着霉死
所以说哥哥跟你说 游戏到此为止

时刻保持战斗状态 
做想做是理所当然
黑暗中的腐朽光环
总是停留在夜深旁晚
老子话都还没讲完
你们就遭我捏成两半	
生活是个婊子你到底屌不屌
不得老子不敢
只有你们想不到
走街上卖点东西好不好	
Motherfucker police 脱不到爪
倾听着城市的声音
肮脏和真实的星星 
太贵咯老子买不起
太好咯老子要买存起
有钱和没钱的区别在于任性
You know, 
生得不好勒个人雀到认命

,
特别勒可以
非常勒可以
绝对勒可以
每天都裹起
点起就说起uh
烟锅巴落你en
全部跪倒Suck my D

,
天气太冷回家穿起我哩座山雕
有人坐冷板凳辈子都不敢翻翘
为啥子我看哩东西你看不到
因为我们高度不同怪我站得太高
可不可以到底可不可以
日天搭配老三OG
我们可以
你不可以
随便批话老子们不摆你
锤子大爷甩你 
锭子悍翻地上摆起
国人在边边瓜起 老子不跟弱智讲道理 哈批
世界浪大我劝你多出起看看
莫孤到屋头刷朋友圈还有探探
莫来我面前装优越你日妈算个卵
老子如果不出歌你听个铲铲

,
It was great at the very start
爱若只如初始般甜蜜
Hands on each other
双手紧握十指相交
Couldn't stand to be far apart
相爱的人无法忍受片刻的分离
Closer the better
始终紧紧依偎
 
Now we're picking fights
不知何时我们开始争吵不断
And slamming doors
甚至气愤地摔门而出
Magnifying all our flaws
不断数落彼此的缺点
And I wonder why
我深思不解
Wonder what for
明明彼此相爱
Why we keep coming back for more
为何用这样的方式证明在意彼此
 
Is it just our bodies?
仅仅是因为身体不受大脑控制
Are we both losing our minds?
而让我们险些失去理智？
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
这是今夜你拥我入怀的唯一理由吗？
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
因为我们都害怕形单影只
Do we need somebody
是否我们都需要一个人填补空虚
Just to feel like we're alright?
伪装自己一切都好
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
这是今夜你拥我入怀仅存的理由吗？
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
只因我们都害怕孤独寂寞
 
Too much time, losing track of us
太久没有联络 彼此慢慢疏离
Where was the real?
早已分辨不出虚实真假
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
不断联系又慢慢淡漠
Forgot how it feels
早已忘记最初的感觉
 
All the messed up fights
争吵到声嘶力竭
And slamming doors
甚至摔门而出
Magnifying all our flaws
不断数落彼此的缺点
And I wonder why
我深思不解
Wonder what for
明明彼此相爱
It's like we keep coming back for more
却用这样的方式证明在意彼此
 
Is it just our bodies?
仅仅因为身体不受大脑控制
Are we both losing our minds?
而让我们险些失去理智？
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
这是今夜你拥我入怀的唯一理由吗？
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
因为我们都惧怕无人作伴
Do we need somebody
是否我们都需要一个人填补空虚
Just to feel like we're alright?
伪装自己一切都好
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
这是今夜你拥我入怀仅存的理由吗？
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
只因我们都害怕孤单寂寥
 
Scared to be lonely
害怕孤单寂寥
 
Even when we know it's wrong
即使明知这想法大错特错
Been somebody better for us all along
有人相伴好过孤身一人
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
告诉我怎样才能彼此坚守？
Holding on tonight
今夜我们紧紧相拥
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

,To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
,What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
,He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
,He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now

,This world is mine for the taking
,Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
,A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
,It only grows harder, only grows hotter
,He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
,Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
,Lonely roads, God only knows
,He's grown farther from home, he's no father
,He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
,But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
,His bosses don't want him no mo, he's cold product
,They moved on to the next schmoe who flow
,He nose dove and sold nada
,So the soap opera is told and unfolds
,I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
,Da da dum da dum da da

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,她是一首最爱的歌 总循环到我睡着
,愿我做辆停不下的火车 她便是没终点的轨道
,无法去形容 是不想放下的背包 带它去天涯海角
,住在我心中 融化 在我的嘴角 全是迷人味道
,对她的想 法多 得数不清 可脾气难 以琢磨
,就算 是拼了命 无法去静下心 总是被她所影响
,遇到她 我像是 一只耳遇到了黑猫警长
,我不会相信也不会让她把我送往分手的刑场
,她是我的存款只想做为他开户的银行
,狂风和暴雨 因为她而变得 晴朗
,生活的味道 慢慢去品尝 一切都会好
,未来的旅途 慢慢去欣赏 不在去计较
,光阴似箭 和她在一起的时间 每个瞬间 都让我留恋
,在脑海不停的重播的画面 关于她的每张照片
,都是我生活的首选 每个细节都 记录在 心上
,在一起的季节 都拍下放进相框
,给她依靠的肩膀 不想有隔阂 只想和她享受着此时此刻
,不在用脾气来指责 用温柔 去宠爱直到适合
,她是我最大的幸运 幸福的转折
,不安的情绪都是因为她而忐忑
,预测不了下一刻的情绪 像是解不开的谜
,有时 温顺的像是绵羊附体 他不知道我的 妒忌
,不知道我的注意 我的呼吸里都藏着她的气息
,熟悉的彻底 致命的袭击 ai 总是失去自己
,给她的拥 抱的还不够 还想继续 的牵着手
,想做她操 控的失控 木偶 做我的幕后
,每一个额 头的吻 都想要留 到明天以后
,不管多么争吵也不会扔 下她一直在她身边在她左右
,她像是一颗大树深深扎根在我胸口
,感谢收听

你先试着把人做好
否则就看看你能有多廉价
你能贱到什么地步

你不要混淆自己的位置
我还要为了我的情人和假期努力呢

,好想付她两耳屎
,把她神光退了
,可惜她不配合
,还先动手打我背了
,
,甚至都没给我一个道歉
,搞得好像我根本就不需要脸
,我跑去给她爸说 给她妈说
,他们娃儿有点恶
,他们喊我为她洒脱
,
,我低著头 默默地抽烟
,希望有天她能变得收敛
,收敛了她那个类似火药的脾气
,不然真会抑鬱 不是在打比喻

,These days are feeling cold, but my heart is feeling colder
,Seems like everybody grows apart when they get older
,If I started drinking, I think I'd be hardly sober
,Chips on my shoulders are turning out to be boulders
,I'm trying to keep my composure
,And they're like, "Why are you changing?
,This ain't how you started
,Don't tell me you're broke, I want to hear you broken hearted
,Talk about the stars, man, don't tell me you're starving
,I want to hear about a girl who broke you down and departed"
,And man, I've been done with it
,What I feel, I run with it
,Always real, I come with it
,Know that you in love with it, so listen up
,Heartbreaks give you breaks for the heart
,Cause its hard to be together when its falling apart
,And I ain't trying to write it down when I don't know where to start
,They want me to pick at these scars to give 'em light in the dark
,And its killing me, we're living all these moment inside
,And I've been building up aggression on the mic and she's like...
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion
,The things I used to love, I would feel many things
,You ask me nowadays, I don't feel anything
,Giving up on love or whatever it means
,To keep somebody around who just eventually leaves
,Like, is this gonna last? Back in the feelings like trash though
,Tired of opinions, tell me, when did I ask?
,I hit up an ex like I've been wanting us back
,How am I thinking of the future when I'm stuck in the past?
,Okay, back in the feelings I go, listen I'm letting you know
,I don't need a phone for me to tell you I'm letting you go
,Everybody's like, "What's with the heartbreak songs, man?"
,Honestly, I've been staying up way to long
,And nobody gets it, no matter what I'm confessing
,If I told you I'm hurting, no ones down to address it
,They hear my words, not the message
,Baby, I'm used to this lesson
,She's standing there like always looking at me and says...
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion
,They say I sound like this, you say I sound like him
,I write what I go through, there's no playing pretend
,Could care less who you think I am, all of you I can see through
,Kids wanna rap, man, I do this cause I need to
,This life ain't a movie, you ain't getting a sequel
,This world is so beautiful, I'm just sick of the people
,Our flag says united, but nobody is equal
,If people didn't kill each other, things would be simple!
,Looking up to God like, "Give me the strength"
,Surrounded by evil, but it ain't breaking my faith
,Talking to too many people to find the feeling you gave
,You can find someone new, but nothing is ever the same
,Looking at the mirror like, "You're not to blame"
,Lying to myself as if I'm not in the rain
,Cause look, even if you're feeling numb, you'll feel all the pain
,And every nights just the same and all this mics ever saying is...
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion
,Baby, leave your struggles in the streets
,Take your aggression out on me
,You know I'm always down to be
,Discreet discretion

,Julia Stiles, I got
,Hello matey it's me, the so shapely overweighty fat fuck
,I'm ice-cream cone crazy
,Oreo tasting, my father don't praise me
,With a beach ball gut like I carry my own baby
,Skin so flakey like a painting in the Louvre (true)
,Socially awkward, I'm strange and I'm aloof
,They made me in a petrie dish, raised me in a tube
,Now I'm driving round the city with a lady in my boot (let me out)
,Innately I'm frustrating, just a vacant kinda dude
,Go walking like I'm Walter, wake up naked in a fugue
,Too many buegs and I'm slower than the YouTube sloth
,Want to fuck with me? You do not
,I'm fat, you should see me with my muumuu off
,Now rappers want to kiss me where my do-do was
,See I smuggled in some googs in my Fubu socks
,Catch me going fucking mental in a Bluejuice mosh
,Julia Stiles, I got
,Julia Stiles, I got
,Julia Stiles, I got
,(So I can go on?)
,It's the fat fuck boy with the flabby gut
,Breathing down the phone, you're like go away, I'm hanging up
,But can he bust quicker than a junkie with his bally up
,Been days since smacking up, don't even get me angry, punk
,See I'm frustrating myself to be around me
,I'm like a twelvie towny, a real freaking downy
,Found me in your driveway, just tryna key your Audi
,Wake up crying in a sweat from a dream of Bieber drowning
,Astoundingly disgusting, there's really nothing there
,In my brain, so deranged, I feel pain punching air
,Cause I can't mow the lawn and the neighbours love to stare
,And my dad's like, "yeah, you gotta grow a fucking pair"
,And my life is Solitaire but I'm too dumb for cards
,Too hyper for Monopoly, I'm too drunk for bars
,More obese than Toadie, got a humongous arse
,Tryna fuck all the time like I'm Susan and Karl
,I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair
,I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare
,I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind
,I hate you so much it makes me sick, it even makes me rhyme
,I hate it, I hate the way you're always right, I hate it when you lie
,I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry
,I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call
,But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close
,Not even a little bit, not even at all

Mix By XANAX
从哪来的滚哪去 I still Fuck U till I die
跟我搞事划不来 say bye 回家做你的爱情买卖
点个外卖 连着WiFi 刷着rapper磕CP
吃 饱了 吵着 搞事 屌丝嘴里跑火车和飞机
饭圈来的跟风狗 我先踢烂你的饭碗
满脸晒着真正丑的hoe 拿点思维逻辑看看
堪比浩克的智力 不如班纳干起架来屌
精神分裂爱开小号的注意 保险让你爸买好
道理通通讲不通 通病是得了讲不通病
身体都在动 挨个过来送 脑袋中了尸鬼封印
过来送命的 组成对人不对事的一大Crew
如果 你们 真的 刷牙 一定是用杜蕾斯的洗发露
龟龟比抽象TV还要抽象 
菜鸟都算不上 因为你们比菜鸟都Young
整天把Diss挂在嘴边 微博上互骂都变成了Diss
Bitch活明白你的每天 我没指望你懂这词意思
这样的例子屡见不鲜 全是会beef的匪帮硬汉
手 指 灵 活 敲 字 搞得我以为你们全都姓段
暗示加大力度 所以你们全都大理 
你们的爱豆我都不怕 难道我会怕你
八十八个八岁孩子抱团打球 难道赢得了哈登？
云雀恭弥从不跟废物组团 因为这样不拉风
你优点忠的像忠犬八公 缺点智力像一只秋田
上课 拿着 手机 刷着 微博 不学习忙里 偷闲
这也难免知识学不到 只能学别人跟风
别人听黑怕的时间论年份你们饭圈女孩就只能论分钟
劝各位珍重 我理解不懂hiphop的大有人在
无非是听听80000病变和抄袭意别的文爱
反正弱的都有理 你们怎么说的反正全都说的对
比你们有名气倒是成了一个把柄不许我做反击还得忍着你们说的废话
“呜！这个人真小气 
发脾气不就是纯眼红
蹭热度刷新波存在感
自以为是的 black man就是想红！”
读书真的很重要 没文化容易把句子曲解
没逻辑只能直接骂 和抄袭意别的CG有什么区别
两年前 你朋友 推荐你 听中文 说唱的 时候是 谁嫌吵
现在又 乖乖的 跟风来 把饭圈 那一套 带过来 没点吊数
总觉得老粉看不起你 
去年的说唱圈遭受了太多猪精和pussy rapper洗礼
说唱听众不听说唱 说唱歌手不会写词只会偷
先评价李志马頔flow牛不牛b？在这评价我的fake flow
说唱是火了 
什么人都要来掺一脚才能凸显出他时尚的潮流和品味
但饭圈女孩是特例一边舔着爱豆
一边骂着hiphop是土哈还孜孜不倦的关注
圈里的大事还见不得
别的 rapper 说句 实话 有着 玻璃心 还装作骂战占了上风
自己狂的不行 不停抱团优越 还提醒你别活在狂妄中
大号都不敢开 可能自己也知道这行为挺好笑
现实生活中敢这么狂么 网上都是老炮
来来来都告诉我 骂我的你们到底有多屌
不就是一群聋子 爱豆放个屁都跪舔说好
别挣扎了 多读点书学学文化讲讲道理
整天YY你的爱豆打call他也不会操你
曲解别人意思外加小学生套路的“反弹”
配合白莲花的双标 真的以为能够让我完蛋？
别多想了 这个套路六年前在贴吧还挺流行
再次印证智商低 吃屎都赶不上热的
不过我也理解 这样的孩子多数可能是家庭出了问题
要不然就是父母溺爱否则就是不管不理
这样的例子见过挺多了 反正网上打字也没什么代价
一群菜鸡乱叫咯 各有各的菜法
什么嘲讽流 引战流 曲解流 狂骂流
你们心里想什么我都清楚
复制粘贴的老模版
求你们做个人吧 别当鹦鹉
当个不一样的烟火
何必处心积虑搞事这么辛苦
也别怪我骂你们 因为你们本身就挺该骂
我可不怎么清高 我都直接微博说你们坏话
不用偷着摸着 装粉丝的bitch趁早还是取关
本来我就是玩自己的 又没要你们喜欢

,找一个人打扫
,不过不好意思
,我跟你们不是一路
,砍死法老的只有我
,你们只能在家吸毒
,一度溢出的伤害
,让群众来不及写下遗嘱
,Fuck你的信仰
,管你穆斯林还是基督
,实力的差距正在扩大
,就像四维高于三维
,用时间发育不管你们弄
,虚作假制造犯规
,把难度调低
,以为你们就能赢过我
,顺手就暴击撕开了

,说唱生涯被你禁锢
,我真的很想剖开进入

,When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
,'Cause even though he's white
,He let us know he standin' with us

,Tie tie to someone forever

,Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
,I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love

hook（邓云峰Mr.Krystal）
都觉得你黑宝沃日嘛国人的东西日嘛都是最好最屌
都觉得自己是rapper沃日尼玛真的是真的是黑不得了
都自我膨胀全他妈怂样你们都自我都自我感觉良好
都自大说废话怕被骂不要脸还他妈要说着宝刀未老 X2

verse (刺猬)
I walk in da street 
任由血液浸透肺
太多人躺在我周围但我不准备赎罪
站我面前你不配
把货塞进车后备
who is mdfk next I prepare to shout your face
太多的enemy都准备killing me 真动手的时候全部都没有底表面上装作都没人被看得起对不起这是几谁他妈认识你
Fuck the gold I feeling cold
像刀片分割掉你们的soul
The hell is where I go
点火前先把他淋上点油
看见的全部是废物一点点风吹都全部都坠入恐惧像匕首般刺进他肋部 背部 拉出的血鹰都标明了你站错队伍
自己有多少的斤两都知道就不要在继续地叫嚣
刺猬和峰峰的verse搭配上现在这黑暗的调调

verse2（邓云峰Mr.Krystal）
黑淇淇的夜 没有灯光看不见
伸手不见五指 现在的我很胆怯
把一切冷却 他说我作品伪劣
把一切毁灭 我要站在最前面
ya 
我放出了大招我扛起了大刀我火爆的像是重庆的辣椒
都说我太酷我有自己态度我的锋芒不能被你们盖住
来喝瓶脉动你莫再去卖弄我攻击的太重打的你太痛
你太小心眼她喊我要轻点这过程很惊险我都是经典
哈 批都是一群废物就像bich都喜欢伪装成贵妇
她 不是我归宿但没有退路都知道我不好对付
全部人心里都全部有鬼
我真的不是很擅长撩妹
做人的方式你一定要对
反正我吃饱了喝完就睡

你听外面风雨交加雨下哒哒哒
妈妈十一点前要喊我回家家家
反正我不爱你你还在想他他他 X2


verse1 (炮弹shell）

搞猫腻你在躲 消息一直在刷
跟情人到处裹探探积目往右边滑
你喜欢这样的感觉 约会各种的社交软件
太多的秘密不想说 恋爱这是个教材的反面

电话过甜的关心 出轨我没有拆穿
我不讨你的欢心 老司机车遭开翻

互相说的 全是放屁 我的心声 兄弟传递
不被看见 就能忘记 如同我小时候 丢了玩具

Yah 寻求你所谓的快感
喊你滚开现在后悔幸好还不算太晚
Ey 寻求你所谓的快感
原来如此 就像一辆bus乘客已载满

verse2 （邓云峰Mr.Krystal ）

oh看天上一对 喜鹊成双成对
看老子单刀赴会 你会的我全都会
不好的都给我滚 不管你想不想我要
汹涌波涛的海啸 我不再掉进你圈套 
灯红酒绿花天酒地 也不去同流合污
社会像是一场游戏 妈妈喊我多读书
说没必要争个输赢但每个领域我都不服输
如果我是绿叶你们是滋润我的露珠
哪怕这辈子注定单身有莽夫陪在我身后 
抛弃我的我不去伸手 让过去回忆慢慢生锈
我知道有个女孩她会出现在家为我做饭
所以那些伤害过我的你们好好去和傻逼作伴

倒置我嘿冒火为撒子每天都感
觉得到高处不胜寒
但我不会轻易斗骄傲自大
而是慢慢的勾勒出宏伟计划
每天都保持到最高的水平线
逐渐的开始了全国制霸
迷妹都说我太酷

脚步也变的快速
想做的全都在做
所以说让你们都晓得到底是哪个在山城最能打

少跟我拿范儿耍宝
不信邪你斗来搞
棍棍按到你身上拷
随便你想朗格怼 老子都无所谓
不管是过捏还是说唱 老子都可以随时奉陪
你算个锤子 专拆你台子 国人跪倒起想认错哩台词
抢老你位子 黑得打摆子 一脚踩死歌词再tia你耳屎
**************************
少跟老子装假 不然斗要遭夹 等唱完勒个bra 老子教你耍trap
没得脑壳哩胎 会看脸色哩乖 挡道哩全部抽拽 毛驹快点给老子爬开
说实话我都是在装 其实也没得嫩个刚 我身上又没得枪 所以你也莫紧张
想刺激来惹嘛 没得耍事都来惹嘛 我晓得你皮子痒想遭旁 老子成全你给你来个心灵创伤
Hook：

ohSokol：
老子要夹你娃毛驹
**************
斗是要让你娃勺皮让你晓得在重庆哪个更牛逼
街上对到妹儿些都吹口哨儿
上半城到下半城哩老板凳儿
没遭医到的崽儿都不信玄儿
我是老大你也只有去当乖宝贝儿
我走到路上斗是楞个哩拉风
不听话哩崽儿老子tia起耳巴子打肿
不管你是哪种他们都想和我耍拢
喊你打个光巴登衣服裤儿甩到马桶
抽了裹老子们一般抽泵
泄个火让妹儿做个春梦
惹到我绝对要把你弄痛
兄弟伙都喊我不要冲动
我虽然随心所欲但是在过捏的时候我还是
用了心
蹲点在每个学校门口等学生放学了出来要
交money
混迹在渝中区小天棒老杂皮聚集地一路上夹毛毛驹
在每条小道里 看到我要小心 旁边哩路人都不敢打幺幺零

当我也找不到方向时兄弟伙坐旁边他给我递了根烟

告诉我强大哩housquad在背后支撑我其他哩放到一边

等我做到了百分之百的时候骄傲的更加明显
 
我把节奏放慢是因为路上还要观赏更多景点
 
当我学会失败的时候成功就会向我发来请柬
 
有一天我也会登上铃兰の顶点

但是 我不着急 不差 百分之一

用尽 洪荒之力 我就是百分之百

,往前去追 往前去飞 看见不该看见由衷的美
,那黑的夜 不停的被 月光冲击不断支离破碎
,生活它就像是一个骗子 给满了未知 万分期待
,不知道何时会先死 逃离死亡的位置 都不存在
,看见了她 说oh my god 走到最后才知道是童话
,陪伴到十二月才知道圣诞节该说声oh oh Merry Christmas
,你心里想的他到底是谁 是b**ch还**到底是gay
,反正老子不满意的把他嘛了剐了干了就算真的god站老子面前一样可以把他杀了
,不然老子总是懦弱显得被动懒惰要你现在看破以为老子不会发火

,当我爬上了山顶的顶端
,俯视着下面所有的景观
,所有问题都变得更简单
,无所谓它们会不会喜欢
,让我的思想变的更缓慢 行为更懒散 把剧情再反转
,音乐变成我忠实的玩伴 灵感急转弯 在举一反三
,新鲜血液 也成长到能够独当一面
,画面浮现 他们每个人针对我的看法都各抒己见
,我照样不屑 虚伪都若隐若现 扑不灭心中火焰
,慢慢沉淀 爆发后就是飞向外太空的rocket火箭
,好奇心让我撒子都想耍一哈
,不忏悔所以f**k圣母玛利亚
,绿色植物让我也变的自大
,我每天活得就像wiz khalifa
,长大后老子开哩战神GTR
,砸了拜拜车用火烧了马自达
,巅峰中进军格莱美和奥斯卡
,Shout out to邓童文他远在加拿大
,时刻保持安全高度所以我感觉不到时间的快慢
,My bro混蛋中的好人他有可能也是好人中的坏蛋
,就用一炷香的功夫轰动全国所有地区引起暴乱
,老子在高处不胜寒 时间争分夺秒都不会怠慢
,我开始措手不及 心理比头发扭曲
,loser都淘汰出局 哈批来打抱不平
,他们都说我不得行 网络的背后嫉妒心不停
,学会跌倒后再爬起 自信让我已经天下无敌

HOOK:
慢一点 请在慢一点
求求你慢一点 
我太累了
事情放一边
福笑：
沥青披肩的车道
香槟美酒的奢好
今天 明天 傍晚 黄昏
好像都没征兆
是吗 你还在那里等
还在原地不停等
我还是一个人
喜欢自己一个人
听着歌 下着雨 即使身无分文
无精打采的眼神 父母变深的眼纹
慢慢刻在生活里的年轮
不甘被束缚我拥自己最深处的灵魂
沿途道路的汽车不停掠过 不停回想年少的那些过错
真的很不甘心 就这么如此堕落
总是不被预料还要不停地争夺
想要多一点钱
就像是生活多加点盐
打开门也只是想要不停地逃脱
我也想爬到社会顶端的上面再说
可是亲人言语在追赶
没有办法摆脱
旧的东西扔了再说
新的开始自己的低头重新琢磨
不用总是这样犯错
直面问题准备起飞不是降落
而是一直向前 已经不能悔过
HOOK:
慢一点 请在慢一点
求求你慢一点 
我太累了
事情放一边
OHSOKOL:
在与你相遇的瞬间我想慢一点
在每晚独自沉睡的梦境里面
我用力的跑 用力的追
在追逐你的路上我也不会疲倦
孩子的笑脸 在生活中的冒险
我们的距离一点一点拉开一圈一圈
每天两点一线 就这样年复一年
每个人脸上的笑容好像也不太明显
慢一点 我看着白云在慢慢飘着
站在天桥 看着街道 行人们快速穿过
我仔细欣赏 城市每个角落的斑驳
时间太快 人们都随波逐流忘记自我
匆匆的脚步来不及停留或者回忆
以前的枯躁我对以后变的更随意
原来的自己放下了也不可能回去
太多的事与愿违太多都想要回避
许多的问题 让我放慢变犹豫
我明白以后必须努力才能出人头
地
我把它当作游戏 这过程更加熟悉
失败的经历都被我当作成长的痕迹
像梅雨时节落的雨 延绵无期
归
来的候鸟在哪里 漫无目的
看白雪悄然无息飘落在大地 
日月星辰交替春夏秋冬四季
鱼儿渴望跃过龙门却沉入海底
漫漫长路沿途风景 一望无际
渴望的她消失很久却不想忘记
时间太快慢一点 我怕来不及
