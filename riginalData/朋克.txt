Temptation frustration your love bleeds into hate
You fed me this apple how *bittersweet* the taste
I wonder if I'll breath again
Then I inhale
Suddenly I vaporize you
Choking on your lies spitting out truth
Open up your eyes to see that I'm not standing here
Suddenly I vaporize you
Wear you like a scar 'till my skin's new
Open up your eyes to see that you have disappeared
So I vaporize you
I felt you cut through me
Like bullets breaking flesh
You want my reaction
For you there's nothing left
I wonder if I'll breath again
Then I inhale
Suddenly I vaporize you
Choking on your lies spitting out truth
Open up your eyes to see that I'm not standing here
Suddenly I vaporize you
Wear you like a scar 'till my skin's new
Open up your eyes to see that you have disappeared
So I vaporize you
Tonight we'll drink it down
A bottle full of promises you made
And then we'll sink and drown right to the bottom
This is where it ends (3x
This is where we end
Suddenly I vaporize you
Choking on your lies spitting out truth
Open up your eyes to see that I'm not standing here
Suddenly I vaporize you
Wear you like a scar 'till my skin's new
Open up your eyes to see that you have disappeared
So I vaporize you

Its going down tonight in this town
Cause they stare and growl
They all stare and growl
I take a scar everytime I cry
Cause it aint my style no it aint my style
Going down to the gravel head to the barrel
Take this life and end this struggle
Los Angeles come scam me please
Emptiness never sleeps at Cliftons 6 am
With your bag lady friend and your mind descending
Stripped of the right to be a human in control
Its warmer in hell so down we go
They say this is the city
The city of angels
All I see is dead wings
,
Its a ghost town rabid underworld
Dionysian night vitriolic twilight
A mirage comes up it never ends
Once you get burnt youre never the same
Left behind erased from time
Aint no decency in being boxed up alive
Look around aint no R.I.P. signs here
We dont rest in peace
We just disappear
So here we are Los Angeles
No angels singing in your valley of unease
I watch the sun roll down the pacific
Over hookered sunset strip
They say this is the city
The city of angels
All I see is dead wings
,
Theres a black moon tonight
Aint shining down on the western neon lights
,
They say this is the city
The city of angels
All I see is dead wings

Monday morning, you woke up crying
The outcome of a stupid line
Said by some punk-ass on the street
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
It wasn't anybody you knew
Is it your old friend insecurity?
The one companion that stuck by your side since you were born
Tuesday night you were in a fight
The same old argument, black and white
It's something that's eating your inside
It's not the food, it's not the booze
It isn't anything consumed
So, is it becoming a problem you can't hide?
So, every time you thought that you were wrong you were right
The devil on your shoulder gives you strength in paranoia
The countless times you called a few
Your best friend 'til the end of time
They'll always be there by your side
Solidify conditions you've abused
What that means you'll never have a clue
More than just a life long friend
No social life I guess we can pretend
It's not like I care but anyway
You always wanna leave, you never wanna stay
Cause you think if you drink too much then you will lose it
You'll drink your security away
The one companion that stuck by your side since you were born
The little voice inside your head, annoying and confusing
That somehow tells you what to do
Socially you've lost your mind and basically you're out of time
You try to build so much it breaks on you
What that means you'll never have a clue
,Lost in your mind
,I wanna know
,Am I losing my mind
,Never let me go
,
,If this night is not forever
,At least we are together
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,
,Anywhere, whenever
,Apart but still together
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,
,Unconscious mind
,I'm wide awake
,Wanna feel one last time
,Take my pain away
,
,If this night is not forever
,At least we are together
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,
,Anywhere, whenever
,Apart but still together
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,I know I'm not alone
,
,I'm not alone, I'm not alone
,I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
,I'm not alone, I'm not alone
,I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone

,Or those cheese filled strudels
,He used to dip into his Frappuccino grand
,Well I must have just been kidding
,Myself into thinking
,I was more than him experimenting

,Yeah we sing
,If it's not enough
,And we sing
,Sing without a reason
,To ever fall in love
,

,Picking up on the signals
,Sent back from within
,Sometimes it feels like I don't really know whats going on

,It fills up till my heart is breaking
,If we had this night together
,If we had a moment to ourselves

,Somehow, you'll see it's all we have
,Love, it keeps us together
,And I need love

,Knowing you're not there
,I'm only feeling half as good

,This is not the end, this is not the beginning
,Just a voice like a riot rocking every remission
,Once you listen to the tone in a violent rhythm
,And all the words sound steady, so nobody forget 'em

,Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
,Cuz we're living at the mercy of the painted riviere
,Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear
,Waiting for the end to come
,Wishing I had strength to stand
,This is not what I had planned
,It's out of my control.
,Flying at the speed of light
,Thoughts were spinning in my head
,So many things were left unsaid
,It's hard to let you go
,I know what it takes to move on
,I know how it feels to lie
,All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
,Holding on to what I haven't got
,Sitting in an empty room
,Trying to forget the past
,This was never meant to last
,I wish it wasn't so
,I know what it takes to move on
,I know how it feels to lie
,All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
,Holding on to what I haven't got
,Yo yo what was that when I thought it was done?
,I thought it felt right, but the right was wrong
,All caught up in the eye of the storm
,And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
,And I don't even know what kind of things I said
,My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
,So picking up the pieces now where to begin
,The hardest part of that is starting again
,All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
,Holding on to what I haven't got

,Inside of me
,but all that they can see the words revealed
,Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
,Nothing to lose
,Just stuck, hollow and alone

,no reflections here.
,Lying cheek to cheek
,in your cold embrace.
,So soft and so tragic
,as a slaughterhouse.
,You press the knife
,against your heart.
,And say,
,“I love you, so much you must kill me now.”
,I love you
,so much

,If I was your vampire,

,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come.
,Digging your smile apart
,with my spade-tounge.
,The hole is where the heart is.
,We built this tomb together,
,and I won’t fill it alone.
,Beyond the pale
,everything is black,
,no turning back.

,Today is a winding road
,that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
,Whoa （whoa' whoa' whoa）
,Today in the blink of an eye
,I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
,I tried
,I tried to read between the lines
,I tried to look in your eyes
,I want a simple explanation
,For what I'm feeling inside
,I gotta find a way out
,Maybe there's a way out
,Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
,Do you know you're unlike any other?
,You'll always be my thunder' and I said
,Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
,I don't wanna ever love another
,You'll always be my thunder
,So bring on the rain
,And bring on the thunder
,Today is a winding road
,Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
,Whoa （whoa' whoa' whoa）
,Today I'm on my own
,I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
,I don't know （I don't know' I don't know' I don't know）
,And now I'm itching for the tall grass
,And longing for the breeze
,I need to step outside
,Just to see if I can breathe
,I gotta find a way out
,Maybe theres a way out
,Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
,Do you know you're unlike any other?
,You'll always be my thunder' and I said
,Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
,I don't wanna ever love another
,You'll always be my thunder
,So bring on the rain
,Yeah I'm walking on a tightrope
,I'm wrapped up in vines
,I think we'll make it out
,But you just gotta give me time
,Strike me down with lightning
,Let me feel you in my veins
,I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain
,Today is a winding road
,that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go

,And listen to the thunder
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practice all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay cause I got no self esteem

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care 
Right? Yeah yeah yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem
  Lie low,lilo 
 
 Lilo start to pack,coz you're never coming back 
 You've gone too far by stealing cars,you are a foolish chap 
 A thief before a man,nicking airbeds from Taiwan 
 Destined for a life of crime,no friends or pension plan 
 
 Now what's he supposed to do? 
 He's goona be caught up with soon 
 And then he'll sing a different tune with the jailbirds whoa-oh 
 Bad luck it's not his day,he'll be found and put away 
 A hefty price he'll have to pay,a lesson learnt 
 
 Lie low,Lilo 
 
 You never had a job,coz it's easier to rob 
 Petty crim'thieving's your thing,then someone had to dob 
 Lie low,no more fun,a kleptomaniac is on the run 
 Someone help him please or else he's gonna come undone 
 
 I know that he'll pinch an inch to swipe a mile 
 Lilo is that kind of guy 
 Although we have been best mates for quite a while 
 And so he goes inside

Learning lines in the rain
Special effects by Loonatik and Drinks
The graveyard scene
The golden years
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Freeze frame screen kiss
Hot heads under silent wigs
Fall guys tumble on the cutting room floor
Look-a-likes fall on the cutting room door
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Learning lines in the rain
Special effects by Loonatik and Drinks
Freeze frame, screen kiss, hot heads, lights (headlights?) and power (powder?)
It's patently obvious
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Hot lines under a rain of drum
Cigarette props in action
Dialogue dub, now here's the rub
She's acting her reaction
She's in parties
It's in the can 

The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
Inspiring dreams, all shattered and blown away
Gathering dust, the band played on again
Personal reasons, are problems in the way
Waking up with just enough time to spare
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Searching out thoughts, we set ourselves a sight
Power and death are always on our minds
The cause is laid out, no looking back for me
The future holds the key for us to see
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

Life is short
Filled with stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough
I've learned all I know
By the age of nine
But I could better myself
If I could only find
Some new kind of kick
Something I ain't had
Some new kind of buzz
I wanna go hog mad
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' for
Something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' and lookin' to find
Some new kind of kick
Some new kind of kick
Gimme a kick
I want a kick
Like baby needs mom
Like Susie needs dick
This baby need
Some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick

Energy! Bar code! Drano hotshot! Wack attack! Helium! Nitrous oxide! Formaldehyde!
Some new kind of kick 

I dare you, to be real
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower in night fright
Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal
I dare you to speak of your despise
For bureaucracy, hypocracy- all liars
I dare
I dare
I dare- you- you
Persuadido por su madre
de que nunca sería un buen general,
aturdido por las bombas
que él decía esquivar.
Sin la medicación necesaria
decidió programar
un viaje a ninguna parte,
donde nadie lo pudiera encontrar.
Y a doscientos veinte kilómetros por hora,
tres días sin comer ni dormir,
le paró un coche de la Guardia Civil
y le pidió su documentación y él dijo ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.
Nominado para un Oscar
en la cumbre de su madurez,
venerado por la crítica
y por los jóvenes también.
A camino entre París y Tokio,
cada gesto suyo lo hacía sucumbir,
su mujer era su musa
y sus cinco hijos brillaban en torno a él.
Impoluto e inmaculado
fue a recibir su galardón,
pero antes de caerse desplomado al suelo
retorció su alma al grito de ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.

,Haz un ruido en mi alma, déjate vencer
,Ahora hay nieve en tus manos
,Y en tu voz ya no hay dolor
,Y aunque estés muy equivocada
,Y aunque tú ya no estés
,En mi cuerpo hay mil espejos donde yo
,Por donde yo te puedo ver
,Por donde yo te puedo ver
,Cuando nadie era nada
,Cuando el ruido era vital
,Cuando un beso era un juego
,Cuando el juego era matar
,Cuando era muy sencillo
,Y podías distinguir
,Cuando en tu cuerpo había nidos
,Que yo podía destruir
,Cuando intuías algo sucio
,Imposible de explicar
,Cuando tus ojos preguntaban estamos
,Donde queríamos estar
,Estamos
,Donde queríamos estar

,Some people say that I'm a melancholy man
,When all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,The sun is blazing as I wander into town
,A long grey overcoat which trails along the ground
,And when I'm walking past the children in the park
,They stop their games, they shout my name
,And run behind my back
,If only they could see how happy I can be
,But sometimes they must look away
,Or so it seems to me
,I think I'll always be a melancholy man
,I know when all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,But if you have the time
,Please listen while you can
,Does anybody understand?
,I'll always be a melancholy man

,Here in your nowhere land
,And how are you today, my melancholy man?
,You saw us looking through a window of a bus
,We smiled at you but you didn't smile at us
,And when you're old and grey
,Your days are at an end
,You'll wish that you had somone who
,You could call a friend
,Yet only I can see how happy you can be
,Oh sometimes they must look away
,Or so it seems to me
,I think I'll always be a melancholy man
,I know when all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,But if you have the time
,Please listen while you can
,Does anybody understand?
,I'll always be a melancholy man
,When all is said and done, my melancholy man
,The sky is blue today, my melancholy man
,'And when no hope was left in sight
,On that starry starry night
,You took your life as lovers often do
,But I could have told you, Vincent
,This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you'
,As beautiful as you, my melancholy man
I believe you when you talk about the past
And I believe that you and I are friends at last
All the silence in this world won't change my mind
Talk about tomorrow or another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?
I believe you always wanted emptiness
And I remember I was full of happiness
All the money in this world won't change my mind
You can save your money for another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?

 I'm in love with the real world
 It's mutual or so it seems
 'cos only in the real world
 Do things happen like they do in my dreams
 Some of the rules may be different
 But maybe they'll stay the same
 In the real world

 We both win when we play the same game
 
 I'm in love with somebody
 I wish somebody loved me too
 You may wonder how this concerns you
 Well perhaps the somebody is you
 I don't even know what your name is
 But i just hope that you'll stay
 In the real world

 By the way what's your name 

  I just wish my life could be as strange as a conspiracy
 I hold out home but there's no way of being what I want to be
 The dragons blow fire angels fly spirits wither in the air
 I'm just me I can't deny I'm neither here, there nor anywhere
 Oh you should see my trail of disgrace
 (Oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)
 It's enough to scare the whole human race
 I said, oh you should see my trail of disgrace

 I don't care about this life, they say there'll be another one
 Defeatist attitude I know will you be sorry when I've gone

,Think of salad days
,They were folly and fun
,They were good, they were young
作词 : Burgess, Fielding, Lever ...
I'm gazing at faces
Staring blankly at me
I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times
I lost my direction while dodging the flak
Oh give me a hint or something 
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
How long will they wait 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
Obnoxious actions
Obnoxious results
Teachers who refuse to be taught
Distorted pictures
And dizzy, dizzy people
Rush by me at the speed of thought
Sitting at tables
And throwing the scraps
For Christ's' sake leave them something
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
Will they hesitate 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
They're dragging me down
Eden
There's no Eden, anyway.
They're dragging me down
You either swim or you drown

Ye
..
她来自凝乱 来自鬼迷心窍

追寻有她的未来却害怕迷路

我欣慰 

曾全神贯注听她说过想去的每个地方

美丽笑 

多么希望我的歌里全是你

你的一颦一笑 嵌在我所有的词句里

Ye

街头大风吹

她的头发乱 

梦里的容颜开始剥落 现实它看穿我的痴想

害怕认知里 想要的 追求的 是我不敢醒来的黄粱一梦

心动是错觉 它开始变得麻木

喜欢你的一举一动一切画面现在只能存在在最初的幻境里 

我逃 我想要逃 我拼了命的跑

我使出全身力气逃出这爱而不得的宿命

总是害怕醒来以后我的世界还是一无所有


Go with the flow

（跟着感觉走）

Follow your dream

（跟着梦想走）

Go with the flow

（跟着感觉走）

只是想要我梦的一切

我是多么向往她在梦里

时光永远停在海枯石烂

拥抱你的梦

Yo

我来自井底 来自异想天开

下 定了决心不管你在天涯

义 无反顾我不管你在海角

无论穷途还是末路 他不认输

永远都不会

画面里感觉她的脸越来越靠近

越来越清 晰心跳已级速血液它沸腾迫不期待想揭开这未来会发生的

人们内心深处一直无论都发 生再大的 在坏的 结局都能坦然面对 

也许可能我的世界每个姿态都体现出太多羞涩

羞涩它永远让自己无法逃脱这现实的轮廓

阿惹告诉我 她等待爱情
妞妞告诉我 她追寻真爱
把最美丽的花 别在她的帽沿上
走遍万水千山 定会去和他相会
就活在阿惹妞 最 爱的童话故事里

妈妈说 把衣服洗干净
漂亮的鞋子不要穿的太臭
她很挑剔 她也很高冷这让我很压抑
定要把步子调走稳我 大凉山的酒是那么易醉人 
应该叫我怎么走稳
你 把我沉默寡言的惹妞喝飘了
看 她的招牌姿势永远那么到位 
反胃 印象最佳的惹妞随便任人摆布 对
妳是可以为所欲为 烂肉朋友 是人是狗 妳也可以各种浪
浪的昏昏 昏昏沉沉可你永远感受不到很多次你失去了我

阿惹告诉我 她等待爱情
妞妞告诉我 她追寻真爱
把最美丽的花 别在她的帽沿上
走遍万水千山 定会去和她相会
就活在阿惹妞 最 爱的童话故事里

大碗的粉丝它太烫 太辣
它把昨夜的头晕目眩全辣醒
把我心目中惹妞形象也辣清
这让我无法接受现实中对你的失落感
Ye 妳也可以不管妳也可以不问 
犹豫在爱与不爱之间 它让我很难受
早已失去对爱情的渴望
失去了愿意为她付出所有的动力
虚伪她还说我 太酷 太炫
酷的每次约酒她们都很绝对的放开
在路上
完全不会保留一点隐瞒
做 做我想做 爱我所爱 

阿惹告诉我 她等待爱情
妞妞告诉我 她追寻真爱
把最美丽的花 别在她的帽沿上
走遍万水千山 定会去和她相会
就活在阿惹妞 最 爱的童话故事里

永远感受不到很多次你失去了我
妳跑什么 妳追什么 妳想什么
什么那天晚上什么什么你的什么他的什么什么看你虚情假意的姿态
看你强颜欢笑的面目
看你口是心非的视界
看你口是心非的视界

,
,I'm always complaining about the way
,The clock ticks life away
,As a matter of fact I know the truth
,That I'm sick of everyday so untrue
,I know
,Things never need to change
,It's all about the answer being out of range
,Every time I try to sneak away
, Even if I fail about hundred times
,The debt on my back I have to pay
,You know I'm never gonna cross the line
,Somebody once said "Let the sky be the limit"
,Come on now, let the game begin
,There's no regretting yesterday
,And tomorrow will be a better day
,I'll close my eyes just for today
,I swear to god I'll find my way
,BREATHE DON'T STOP
,I'LL FIND MY REVELATION
,I'LL START MY EVOLUTION NOW
,止まることないこの衝動は
,どんな世界見せてくれるだろう?
,I'LL TRUST MY INTUITION
,I'LL START MY REVOLUTION
,失うことない時間の中で共に生きる
,革命起こして CHANGE MY GENERATION
,REPLAY
,I'm waking every night from the same dream
,Just like a Hollywood scene
,My distress is endless
,And I feel like I'm oppressed now!!
,Tedious days
,One, two, three・・・
,Countless memories don't exist
,Afraid of ending up all alone
,Falling down on a lonely throne
,As I feel, as I think
,Not everything is clear to see
,Maybe the answer that I need
,Has always been there right next to me
,Finally, the key I seek
,The one last piece completing me
,Now there's nothing more to fear
,One step at a time just
,FEEL THE BEAT GET SET
,JUMP START
,I'LL FIND MY REVELATION
,I'LL START MY EVOLUTION NOW
,飽きることないこの感動は
,どんな夢見せてくれるだろう?
,I'LL TRUST MY INTUITION
,AND START MY REVOLUTION
,消えることない遠い記憶今は辿る
,覚悟決めて MAKE A RESOLUTION
,AN INNOCENT ILLUSION
,WILL OPEN UP OUR VISION
,枯れることないこの声は
,誰かいつか気付いてくれるんだろう?
,SO LET OUT YOUR EMOTION
,A BRAND NEW DESTINATION
,終わることない季節数え続いていく・・・
,I'LL FIND MY REVELATION
,AND START MY EVOLUTION NOW
,止まることないこの衝動は
,どんな世界見せてくれるだろう?
,I'LL TRUST MY INTUITION

, 你给我一大屋的烦恼和我作对
, Im just a kid!Life is a nightmare!
, Nobody care!Nobody like me!
, 我能怪谁?
, 我到底想做什么 我真想不出来
, 只知道现在干的让我看不见未来
, 就象一个总在想变成风筝的内酷
, 由于拉锁拉得紧我根本飞不出来
, 我的朋友们 大家通通都在混
, 因为我们不再是小孩
, 但还没成为那些大人
, 世界那么大 我却不知道站在何处
, 郁闷 是那儿 是哪儿啊
, 不用郁闷啦 我迎来我的公主
, 她的一切融化我 哦，好舒服!
, 感觉爱情扑来啦 那就跟我回家吧
, 先……后……
, 她们不是女魔头 就是寄生虫
, 但是我却对着她们说 我—爱—你
, 因为既然别人都 手握手 甜蜜蜜
, 而我在家握着 电视遥控器
, Hello 你好 我的19岁
, 你给我一大屋的烦恼和我作对
, Im just a kid!Life is a nightmare!
, Nobody care!Nobody like me!
, 我能怪谁?
, 我朋友对我说
, 唉哟 我难受得快要死了
, 上课老师说我 下课痞子打我
, 回家爸爸骂我
, 我拥有的财产 就是好几万个规定
, 真的真的真的 干脆死了算了
, 我们都委屈都空虚都压抑都恐惧
, 反正除了抱怨没有任何权利
, 我该怎么度过青春期
, 为什么它满脸写着不高兴
, 以前经常恶作剧
, 现在没人一块玩儿了
, 他们说我已经长大
, 就应该成熟点儿了
, 废话 我还不知道我自己长大
, 可我真的讨厌长大
, 我也不知道为什么

,我  走出门外
,路灯都闪烁着
,在晕眩的夜晚
,闭上眼  没有期待
,只是在不断走  心跳得很明显
,我感觉到  飘起来  随着风摇摆
,身体软软的  一片片雪白
,也许是月亮在依偎着我
,躺在它上面享受如此清澈
,听见天使悦耳地唱起歌
,整开眼却是  妈妈叫起床吧
,路灯都熄灭了
,真后悔整开眼……

,Why didn't someone tell me I had my eyes closed
,I watch what I eat, since super size me
,Since the internet my space be the in thing

,As we enter
,Come now we take you on the biggest adventure
,Must be dementia, that you ever thought
,You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?
,You be Jamrock the lyrical official
,Send out the order, laws and the rituals
,Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
,It is truth we big news, we hood heroes
,Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
,Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
,And I got the guns
,I got the ganja
,And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
,Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
,Or you could run up and get done up
,Or get something that you want none of
,Unlimited amount you collect from us
,Direct from us, street intellectuals
,And I'm shrewd about decimals
,And my man'll speak Patois
,And I can speak rap star
,Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
,Or body Ghani
,Masuri Sana
,Switch up the language and move to Ghana
,Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
,Rhythm piranhas
,Like two Obamas, unfold the drama
,Word is out, hysteria you heard about
,Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
,Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
,The kings is back, time to return the crown
,Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
,Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
,Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
,Either move on or move on it
,Queens to Kingston
,Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
,Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
,Realize you can die any instant
,And I can hear the sound of a voice
,When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
,Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
,And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
,Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
,Come around and be persistent
,That's how you end up in a hitlist
,Ain't no bad man business
,No evidence
,Crime scene, fingerprint-less
,Flow effortless
,Casual like the weekends
,No pressure when
,We're comfy and decent
,We set this off beasting
,Hunting season
,And, frankly speaking...
,Word is out, hysteria you heard about

Slow down baby uhh 
Slow down baby uhh 
You can get rugged, though, hard like 
P Trying to play my man but you couldn't touch me 
You faggot to comp rapper on a quest 
You get your head flown, boy you must be smokin' sens 
So many often wonder if 
MDs paid You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way '
Cause I clock 
Gs while you clock 
Zs And I don't smoke crack, 
I smoke M.
C.s So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take notes 
A rapper suffred from bleeding, sprains and slit throats 
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic 
Rapper choke like a curburetor, freeze up, and panic '
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell ileyo 
Another name for cocaine, mi amigo 
That's Spanish terminology for friend 
Now sit back and rub my bozack as 
I send Bass funk with beats that thump 
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk 
My system cranking, my headlights are blinkin' 
Brother ridin' my tip, 
L, at the same time thinkin' 
Damn, how could a brother be so nice '
Cause I'm the capital 
E-P twice 
M-D-E twice 
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight 
I like to write but then again some bite 
While you were bangin' on tables, 
I was bangin' 
Snow White 
Yeah slow down baby 
The ripper, the master, the overlordian 
Playing M.
C.s like a old accordion 
I get the inspiration from a necessary station 
Them sayin' 
I was vacationin' 
You can't cope with your weak-ass throat 
Tryin' 'a sneak a peak in while 
I freak the notes 
Major M.C.s become minor 
B flats So retire the mike, get your chains and your bats 
Here's your chance to advance, gettin' your stance 
I'm 'a shoot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment 
You're quilty, face down on the pavement 
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred 
You and your squad better praise the real god 
The undertaker droppin' thunder on fakers 
When it comes to lyrics 
I'm as freaky as 
Seka So lay the mike down slow and careful '
Cause mine is fully loaded and 
I have another handful 
A clip to slip in and start rippin' 
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin' 
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds and so 
I'm down so that you clowns will know 
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated 
I got rhymes up the (huh) forget it, 
I'm constipated 
Yeah slow down baby 
When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget 
I master on the beat down, my style's rugged 
When I attack the microphone, close the zone 
Rap sees danger, can't roam 
Security is packed and wall to wall can't fall 
A rap tank is full so 
I can't stall 
My microphone is filled with premium 
Any whack 
M.C. that flexes, 
I'm creamin' 'em 
Not with lotion, bust the motion, flotation 
When I'm rockin' the mike 
I'm like coastin' 
Underneath fatigue at my peak 
You still seek the style 'cause yours is extra weak 
New method, rip the stage at my age and get loose and kick 
Like Bruce in a rage-
I'm on a rampage 
Yeah slow down baby 
Slow down baby
作词 : Benjamin, Patton
UhhAs I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
We finna enhance your brain, check it out
Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the pointe didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walkin' to the sto'
Caught a nigga slippin', but now 
I lay it to the flo'
Just like carbon, 'cuz 
I got the heat in my rhythm
Momma nay not, never braggin' just to stay knot
Even when 
I was a younger lad 
I learned my lesson
Ever talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions
The pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cuz we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like 
Bluto when he cut up olive oyl
Two things 
I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they call
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up 
I did, but 
I did so not safely
Don't want no aids, no claps, or no rabies
Yo, we take no shit, like umm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand fo'
But not for long 'cuz we got a better sack to serve
Tryin' to take you other people for your rims at the curb
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go head, go head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like for fears, you know
Shout shout let it all out, just for my peers
And pupils who feel like it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Okay, like this, yeah yeah
One time for my boy doing king shit
Two times for legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times outkast and it don't stop
One time for my 'cuz doing queen thangs
Dead fresh to the teeth eatin' chicken wings
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop
Four times outkast and it don't stop
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel

,All you needed was a table top and a beat box
,Hip-hop with out the b-boy is like
,shelltoes only havin' two stripes
,Hip-hop we're freedom-fighting graffiti-writing party types,
,That recite and organize and revitalize our rhymin till the group of the money makers systems knows the industry can eventually get served.
,Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolutions throughout our words
,If you really want it come on get it coz i've got it
,I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn.
,If you wanna earn your stripes you gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike.
,The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
,or never be documented in the Coke(?) commercial.
,(We be the badest)
,Now b-boys, b-girls
,bring it back to the block.
,Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock.
,If you record without thought then stop,
,because I'll serve ya whole album with the goddamn beatbox.
,Without thought it just happens.
,If you gotta think to feel that's not rapping that's acting.
,I'm from a land of backpacks and fat-caps,
,MC's with sick raps who serve those that are wack.
,It's a way of life;
,I put all my energy into the melody on the MPC's until the death of me, record exceptionally, especially, whenever i be monumentally, gramatically, killing the mic.
,I tell my DJ's, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays,
,Staying into it, breaking and grooving(?), and MC's they, thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make, taking from lucid (??).
,All the people gotta make their money,
,and the way to make money is to get inside of the industry,
,take it on the radio, flow
,so you can go blow,
,we get a car and a crib up on MTV,
,but,In the end what's classic?radio bubblegum?
,or a voice filled with passion?
,To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up,
,'cause the only people that can preserve this art is us!

Follow The Leader

Children in a line
Outta be benign
But following the leader
You can underplay
There will come a day, oh whoa
Lowering of voice
Imaginary choice
You've got your pick of either
Heavy head or heart
Business faking art
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa
Life is long
So far it's been easy
But I just want you to know
Anticipating bills
Summarizing skills
For following the leader
Worthy of your trust
Obedience, a must
Oh, oh, whoa

I need to obey someone
And I would never betray that someone
I find everyday someone
Gets in line

In line

In matters of import
Muster up support
To follow the leader
Walk the dotted line
Initial here and sign
Oh, oh, whoa, oh
Life is short
So you choose your battles
Sometimes all you can choose

Everything confirms
In no uncertain terms
You're following the leader
They got your number and
Their wish is your command
Oh, oh, whoa

Don't let them get away with it
Don't give them satisfaction
Fall in, but don't fall for it
You're not the only one
And you know it
Just so you know it
Ah
,La la, la la la...
,Hush, don’t speak
,When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
,When you hiss and preach
,About your new messiah ’cause your theories catch fire
,I can’t find those silver linings
,I don’t mean to judge
,But when you read your speech, it’s tiring
,Enough is enough
,I’m covering my ears like a kid
,When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
,I’m turning off the volume when you speak
,Cause if my heart can’t stop it, I find a way to block it
,I go
,La la, la la la...
,La la, la la la...
,I find a way to block it
,I go
,La la, la la la...
,La la, la la la...
,Yes our love is running out of time
,I won’t count the hours, rather be a coward
,When our words collide
,I’m gonna drown you out before I lose my mind
,I can’t find those silver linings
,I don’t mean to judge
,But when you read your speech, it’s tiring
,Enough is enough
,I’m covering my ears like a kid

So, just sit back and 
Max and relax
Off tracks that 
I kick, come on and give it up'
Cause, I get funky like diaper rash
And you know 
I'm mad spunky and 
I'm making cash
I've got sex rhymes like 
Victoria's got secrets
To all you prone peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al 
Goldstein, 
I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man 
Pat EwingLike getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of 
A.KLike a sound that go to the depths of the soul
Well that's the feeling that 
I make my goal
A little wine with my dinner so 
I'm in my grape ape
I feel like a winner when 
I make a mix tape
Because I get 
I'll when 
I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train then 
Don Cornelius
Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
Wires hitting switches connecting at the junction
Perl man's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in S.
D. 50 till early morning
Who's going to rock the nation?
Who's going to rock the nation?

,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat

,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eye ball
,Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,Now another year has come
,Like the last and the one before
,I'm waiting in the cabin by the shore
,
,When the night comes crawling in
,Bells chimes and tamber ring
,I thought I heard you knocking on the door
,Hear the drops of drizzle time
,About the long gone fairytale
,I let them know my wish again
,
,Raindrops falling on the rooftop
,And again they bring up
,All the lone gone memories
,Raindrops falling on the rooftop
,I will never give up
,Hope I'll meet you here
,
,Last year I'm the one before
,In the cabin by the shore
,You gave mud hut chamber change the breadth
,Remember how we scratched the names
,In the tree right by the lake
,I went over to see if it's still there
,
,When you hear the bells from afar
,I'll be waiting there in the dark
,And send my wish upon a star
,
,Raindrops falling on the rooftop
,And again they bring up
,All the lone gone memories
,Raindrops falling on the rooftop
,I will never give up
,Hope that I'll meet you here

,Happy end of every year
,You will find me waiting here
,For you to come along
,Right down to the shore

,And tell them now that I’m just too busy
,Cause I don’t have the time
,And its funny how my so called friends

Yo,
Give me a second, I'll write about my pain for pages,
I got a head full of frustrated phrases,
So just bear with me as i get this out,
You know the type of person that i'm talking about.
These people who want to act like they've got your back,
They never had your back, they just stab you in it,
I never pretended i had it all together inside,
I got insecurities and things that I'm trying to hide,
And I could, never seem to get anything right,
And I could, never seem to stop busting my fight,
And I could, never seem to get it right with you,
And I could, never redeem myself when i'm through,
But sometimes, you know what? I just don't care,
I'm gonna speak my mind and let everybody stare,
This is the last time, I'm telling you real loud,
You wanna tell me I'm wrong? let's do it right now.
Start it all up, I'm ready to go,
All I need is a signal just to let me know,
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want,
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got.
Start it all up, I'm ready to go,
All I need is a signal just to let me know,
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want,
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got.
Give me a minute, I'll fill a newspaper with collumns,
'cuz people saying that I got an additude problem,
That I'm negative when I rhyme, I complain,
Pessimistic all the time, in these lines,
All the same, I just talk like this on a record and let it out,
I just, cock back and let it all come flooding out,
I just, say the things that I know I feel are real,
I peel back the kin 'till the nerves reveal,
You want to come with me? come closer to the speaker,
You want to run with me? you're gonna have to dig deeper,
You wanna let it all out, I'll show you how,
You wanna tell me I'm wrong?, we can do it right now.
Start it all up, I'm ready to go,
All I need is a signal just to let me know,
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want,
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got.
Start it all up, I'm ready to go,
All I need is a signal just to let me know,
Come on, start it all up, 'cuz all I want,
Is an excuse to let loose the tension I got.
Mike Shinoda.
The most ferocious.
Mike Shinoda.
With or without an accomplice.

Start it all up, I'm ready to go,

How was I to know that?
Well, it seemed like an eternity
When you smile and say,"I thought about it, it's the right time"
And I expect that
You're never returning to the 
USA(Oh, Oh)
All the way the lights are
I can see your face is getting clearer
It's like you never even left here
It's like you never had the reason
To want to go. 
Well, I don't know
I think it's time for you to face it
You never felt right in our world
You never felt right about yourself
And I think about what it might be like
If I could go alone, if 
I could go at night
Would it be just like you know you said it would
Would it start the life aglow

The tinge of the mind

You made your offer
A little too soon
It's not the first time it's happened
In a moment you said
You don't want to know me
It's seems as though that's never done
What I'm seeing as hopeless
You're seeing as ...
Won
The story asking
Could we be together tonight
I was raised by a different standard
And it wouldn't seem right
Ah ...
It doesn't seem important
I'd like to know what matters then
As it happened they already did
I don't remember it
Loveless love
Is not my plan
Loveless love
Said it isn't romance
Loveless love
You think it's cool I think it stinks
Loveless love
You don't care what I think
Well nobody's perfect
It's not the way you were raised to be-have
Try to understand
That's not the way to be

作曲 : Burrows, Havas, Jones
Somewhere the blast furnace explodes
Plumes of amber in the night sky
Each explosion bounces
From horizon to horizon
From horizon... to horizon
And for a while, the slow pulse boy
Stood by the window
And let the fire sink into his skin
Again all was still
But for the empty tin
Rolling up and down a gutter
On the breeze
Then we were standing very close
I could live in the space
Between his heartbeats
Outside the blast furnace errupts again
And dark red rivers
Filled our veins with frenzy
We could tear up the floors
And find all the things we'd ever lost
And the fire burns in our jack boots
So we chase the explosions
From horizon to horizon
Wrap ourselves around the distance
For as long as we can hold
Somewhere a girl is singing
There is calm in the air
But there is greater calm than I can bear
Tomorrow the sun shines

  我一天天的长大
 爸爸一天天的变老
 我一天天的变老
 爸爸一天天的衰老
 我刚学会了生活
 爸爸已被生活压垮
 我刚感到了痛苦
 爸爸已经变的麻木
 我不能再走爸爸的那条路
 我不能再和爸爸一个样
 所以我会在变成爸爸那样之前死去 

,其实我跟她也不是很熟
,可是她的故事让我想了很久
,为了爱挺著大肚子
,每天上班下班要骑著摩托车赶回家
,在她宣布她要和他结婚
,周围的朋友告诉她不要上当
,这个男孩子以前的记录很差
,如果错一步终身不会幸福
,终于到了结婚的那一天
,新娘衣服让她变得特别漂亮
,也准备了几桌给她的朋友
,却听说有一桌都没有人坐
,偏见流言左右你的视线
,原来人情冷暖就是这样
,当她选择一条未知的道路
,祝她一路顺风
,让她走吧
,需要多少挣扎多少勇气
,我们每一个人都比不上她
,当朋友渐渐疏远不打电话
,猜想她不知道会如何想
,因为爱情变得非常伟大
,却没有人几个人会看得清楚
,好像只有我一个人祝福她
,希望她的娃娃比较像她
,My mama told me off
,She said I'd done her wrong

,I've been a bad bad boy
,I've been bad
,I've been a bad bad boy
,I've been bad
,And now she keeps me in
,I'm paying for my sin
,The door is locked  I can't go out
,I have apologized
,How I've really tried
,And not to be a bad boy
,I've been a bad bad boy

,From the west unto the east.
,Any day now, any day now,
,I shall be released.
,They say ev'ry man needs protection,
,they say ev'ry man must fall.
,Yet I swear I see my reflection
,Some place so high above this wall.
,I see my light come shining
,From the west unto the east.
,Any day now, any day now,
,I shall be released.
,Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
,he's a man who swears he's not to blame.
,All day long I hear him shout so loud,
,Crying out that he was framed.
,I see my light come shining
,From the west unto the east.
,Any day now, any day now,
,I shall be released.
,oh

,Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
,There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
,There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
,There's a tree where the doves go to die
,There's a piece that was torn from the morning
,And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost

,Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
,On a chair with a dead magazine
,In the cave at the tip of the lily
,In some hallways where love's never been
,On a bed where the moon has been sweating
,In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
,Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
,Take this waltz, take this waltz
,Take its broken waist in your hand
,
,This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
,With its very own breath of brandy and Death
,Dragging its tail in the sea
,There's a concert hall in Vienna
,Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
,There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
,They've been sentenced to death by the blues
,Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
,With a garland of freshly cut tears?
,Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
,Take this waltz, take this waltz
,Take this waltz it's been dying for years
,There's an attic where children are playing
,Where I've got to lie down with you soon
,In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
,In the mist of some sweet afternoon
,And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
,All your sheep and your lilies of snow
,Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
,Take this waltz, take this waltz
,With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"
,This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ...
,With its very own breath of brandy and Death
,Dragging its tail in the sea
,And I'll dance with you in Vienna
,I'll be wearing a river's disguise
,The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,
,My mouth on the dew of your thighs
,And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
,With the photographs there, and the moss
,And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
,My cheap violin and my cross
,And you'll carry me down on your dancing
,To the pools that you lift on your wrist
,Oh my love, Oh my love
,Take this waltz, take this waltz
,It's yours now. It's all that there is
,
,Loneliness my old friend
,You've reared your head again
,And it hurts
,And I'm sickened to the bone

,I feel so blue
,Nobody aches
,Like I do
,
,I'm scared
,I'm unaware
,I'm unprepared
,And now I'm scared most all of
,Never feeling good
,
,The fear in me it takes hold
,To paralyse and control my world

作词 : Blasphemer, Maniac
Caress the deceitful snake, 
The one who speaks in tongues
Of all my devastating truths, 
Collect the power of my dreams
A fiendish lust a hallow trust.
Cast by the devious fire demons, 
A thousand whorish tongues
In Black Death, salute the visions, 
Mayhem of living, infected blood.
In this, dark night of the soul!!(Chorus)
I close my eyes to the world, 
Kiss my skinless corpus,
Make me revel in your weak souls, 
Make me feast on your nightmares.,
Death's heads enshrined in my head, 
I deal exclusively in mysterious pain
The mystical blood runs tonight, 
Gifting through your inner thighs,
I seal the orbits of misanthropy.
A moment of inconceivable lust
,I have my mother's dreams
,I have my father's eyes
,You can't take that from me
,Just go ahead and try
,The cursed city sleeps
,Watch ions in the sky
,Preparing to unleash
,Let loose a mighty cry
,Can nobody save us?
,Will anyone try?
,The pyre is burning
,The severance is dying
,And all along they say it
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Hold my hand to help see
,Right there in front of me
,Help is on the way
,
,Five thousand feet below
,As black smoke engulfs the sky
,The ocean floor explodes
,Eleven mothers cry
,My bones all resonate
,A burning lullaby
,You can't take that from me
,Just go ahead and try
,She says that's the shoreline
,With hands in the air
,Her words miss the dark light
,Does anyone care?
,And all along they say it
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Help is on the way
,said' they

I never count on yesterday
Because the past can also change
I'll never give myself away
Life is worthwhile on the edge
Words sound so hollow in the cold
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
Signs never told me anything
Nothing I could know for sure
I never knew what she would bring
Or what I am to her today
My words...
Almost swallowed by the snow
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
She is the poison in my mind
The thorns in my head
She has no mountain to be climbed
No faults to regret
I never count on yesterday
Because the past may not exist
I'll never give myself away
When there's reason to resist
Words draped in crystals melt away
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow

,6 a.m. Christmas morning.
,No shadows,
,no reflections here.
,Lying cheek to cheek
,in your cold embrace.
,So soft and so tragic
,as a slaughterhouse.
,You press the knife
,against your heart.
,And say,
,“I love you, so much you must kill me now.”
,I love you
,so much
,you must kill me now.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come.
,Digging your smile apart
,with my spade-tounge.
,The hole is where the heart is.
,We built this tomb together,
,and I won’t fill it alone.
,Beyond the pale
,everything is black,
,no turning back.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come
,Blood-stained sheets
,in the shape of your heart,
,this is where it starts…
,Blood-stained sheets
,in the shape of your heart,
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,6:19 and I know I’m ready
,Drive me off the mountain.
,You’ll burn,
,I’ll eat your ashes.
,The impossible wheels seducing
,our corpse.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come.
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.

,Never  again  will  I  taste  in  your  passion
,this  vain  call  that  dies...
,Never  across  sacrifice  will  I  lose  my  dark  guide...
,Dazed  in  my  dark  and  ephemeral  wail  that  rapes  a  cool  light,
,in  a  corpse-like,haunted,nightmare  I  die...
,Never  in  life
,After  tonight
,Through  my  sighs
,Don ’t  you  change
,I  will  lie
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Wavin ’this  shine,overwhelmed  by  this  whirl,
,and  you  engravin ’my  gaze  heavenwards  in  your  face,
,are  greedy  of  grace  and  lust.
,Graspin ’your  heart,
,you  mourn  through  risin ’of  holy  embraces.
,Groanin ’through  this  tearflow,I  feel  It ’s  getting  dark...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,maybe  this  light,Blind  Lantern,in  the  Silence,is  blindin ’my  mind...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,maybe  this  Lantern  in  the  Silence,cries.....and  lies.

,I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up

, A full throttle in the bottle like that home-made shine
, I'm just tryin' to make a livin', boss man trippin'
, My overtime's strong; I don't pay him no attention
, Money in the mason jar, country boy pension
, No lady, three kids, take a lot to fill the kitchen
, Fingernails dirty, my back stay hurtin'
, You can bet I got to play for every penny that I'm earnin'
, I ain't askin' for a raise, but I know the boss heard me
, Nobody on this job site's workin' like I'm workin'

, We never sleep in, that ain't how we was brought up
, I push it to the limit when the money gets low
, And been known to work past when the plant whistle blows
, Pay check feelin' like a lottery ticket
, I might save a couple bucks if my kids don't spend it
, It don't matter cause I love it every day of my life
, Spent more time on the clock than I do with my wife
, State to state, never late, puttin' miles on the road
, Drop it off, fill it up, get me to my next load
, Call my old lady, let her know I'll be late
, And I ain't worry cause I know that she goin' to save me a plate
, I told you thirty below to a hundred degrees

Blown away Blown away
Baby I'm gonna aft blow you away
I'm blown (15)
You make me feel like a stranger in my own house
You got me running around just like a scared mouse
You were always saying that I was your destiny
Then pretty baby why aren't you here next to me
You made all of my dreams
And fantasies come alive, but it was lies
I gave you all my love and got shot between the eyes
Well baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away
You got me feeling like a stranger in my own heart
I'm acting so together but I'm falling apart
I'm begging lover, begging Mother, begging Saviour please
I ain't got no leg to stand on much less my knees
You never even tried to let me know where we stand
Was it planned?
That when you ran away you'd leave a bomb in my hands
And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away
Were all these dreams for nothing?
You make me want to cry
We made this flower to grow girl
Not to die
I'm blown (15)
Baby I'm gonna aft blow you away
And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away
Baby why did you have to blow us away
Baby I'm gonna aft you blow you away(2)

Endless nights I spend
Trying to figure out 
How to live without you 
And though easier it seems it is
Never should have chanced at this 
How was it a hit and miss
We'll never know 
It's time to go 
Closing time at two
Don't know what to do
I can't get you off my mind
And so baby just a drink or two
The more I sit and think of it
Another drink and it'll slip
From the mind
Please pour the wine
Now that it's past two 
Took off both my shoes
I don't really care at all
Because I don't really have a choice
You know we both chose our path 
Now it's got to stick and last
For the time
I paid the price
Trying to make sense 
I'm just tired of it all 
Always gonna be in my thoughts
You and me
We're meant to be
And it's okay

I don't wanna play around no more
I see that black cross painted on your door
We was good friends for a long, long time
But, baby, you got hungry for a life of crime
Get the message now?
The car you drive is painted red and gray
But if you ask me to get in, well, I'll just run away
We was good friends for a long, long time
But, baby, you got hungry for a life of crime
Get the message now?

,Well, take me back down where cool water flows, y'all
,A-let me remember things I love, Lord
,Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
,Walkin' along the river road at night
,Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight
,I can hear the bullfrog callin' me home
,Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
,Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
,Shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
,Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River
,Well!
,Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
,With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
,Old Cody Junior took me over
,Said, "You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
,And if you get a-lost, come on home to Green River"
,Well!
,Come on home
,           Goodbye to you, my trusted friend.
, We've known each other since we were nine or ten.
,Together we've climbed hills and trees,
,learned of love and ABC's,
, skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.
,Goodbye, my friend.
,It's hard to die
,when all the birds are singing in the sky.
,Now that spring is in the air
,pretty boys are everywhere.
, Think of me and I'll be there.
,   Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me.
, I was the black sheep of the family.
,You tried to teach me right from wrong.
, Too much wine and too much song.
, Wonder how I got along.
, Goodbye, papa.
,It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky.
,Now that the spring is in the air,
,Little children everywhere.
, When you see them, I'll be there.
,
,
,   Goodbye, Michelle, my precious one.
,You gave me love and helped me find the sun.
, And every time that I was down,
, you would always come around,
,and get my feet back on the ground.
, Goodbye, Michelle.
,It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky
,Now that spring is in the air,
,with the flowers everywhere,
, I wish that we could both be there.
,   We had joy, we had fun,
, we had seasons in the sun,
,but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time.
,We had joy, we had fun,we had seasons in the sun,
, but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach.
,
,
,The road is long
,You're gonna get thrown about
,Stick to the rhythm
,Breathe it in and breath it out
,Do what you do, there isn't any secret
,Chop wood, draw water, roll cigarettes
,Find a lover, put a flower in her hair
,Climb a mountain, see the mountain disappear
,Be the first to go back to the ghost town
,Break bread with the man that's gonna bring you down
,Deep, deep down
,I listen and I hear what's said
,I follow it from a to zed
,But wisdom hasn't found me yet
,You're feeling scared, Jesus is your bodyguard
,You feel alone, take a look in your backyard
,Put your eye to the eye of a telescope
,The universe looks back through a microscope
,Adopt a highway, dress yourself in camel hair
,A wasted life is a life lived unaware
,Make money, put it on a number eight
,Tempt fate, maybe you're a wheel goin' round
,Round and round
,I listen and I hear what's said
,I follow it from a to zed
,But wisdom hasn't found me yet
,I listen and I hear what's said

,So many stories of where I\'ve been
,And how I got to where I am
,But these stories don\'t mean anything
,When you\'ve got no one to tell them to
,It\'s true...
,I was made for you
,
,I climbed across the mountain tops
,Swam all across the ocean blue
,I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
,But baby I broke them all for you
,Because even when I was flat broke
,You made me feel like a million bucks
,Yeah you do and I was made for you
,
,You see the smile that\'s on my mouth
,Is hiding the words that don\'t come out
,And all of my friends who think that I\'m blessed
,They don\'t know my head is a mess
,No, they don\'t know who I really am
,And they don\'t know what I\'ve been through but you do
,And I was made for you...

,It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
,Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor

,And lock all the doors

,我不是油嘴滑舌的人
,你可知19岁的天真
,布满皱纹的城市都在因为你
,而变得越来越青春
,我的心情总是失落
,我懂女孩子是矜持的
,你的耳机里到底听的是什么
,有没有我熟悉的歌
,我想发寻你的传单
,可是我没有你的照片
,只好写初识游泳馆 大厅的里面
,我们不见不散
,我想发寻你的传单
,可是我没有你的照片
,我猜在南锣的里面 中戏的门前
,或许你会再次出现
,我猜在南锣的里面 书店的门前
,你也等待我的出现
,我会在南锣的里面 江湖的门前
,握着啤酒等你出现
,我猜在19岁这一天 青春的一半
,我与你会注定擦肩

,忽然想起 那年夏天 我弹琴在路边
,唱着一首不知名的英文歌
,天色已晚 你从人群中发现了我
,就这样安静的听着
,过了很久 我的生活 仍有你在左右
,聊过夜深 也曾想你到白昼
,我也想过 是否有一天 我们无路可走
,二十出头 可已看过多少悲欢离合
,也许你也忐忑
,也许你也失落
,也许你也背着我喝了一杯酒
,也许你也困惑
,也许你也不懂
,可是最美不过那夜和你看过的星空
,关于以后 我们闲聊时也提及了许多
,你喜欢小猫 我要养一只笨狗
,你曾说过 重庆是一座美丽的城市
,那条种满梧桐 是你走过多年的路
,如果你也相信
,如果你也坚定
,如果你也不在意流言与蜚语
,如果你也愿意
,如果你也可以
,等我们老了以后 就定居在这里

,飞向遥远的山涧
,踩着云朵柔软的表面
,清泉流动的傍晚
,雾水氤氲在窗前
,我是一只白色的百灵鸟
,翅膀上有风铃在摇晃
,山谷里的树影静悄悄
,白色的美梦就要来到
,揉碎梦境的边疆
,踏向悬在晨曦中的桥梁
,告别微寒的空旷
,闪烁春暖的熹光
,我是一只白色的百灵鸟
,眼中灯笼撒在湖面上
,抖落露水编织的白紗帐
,白色精灵呢喃在歌唱

,靠嬉笑来虚度 聚散得慷慨
,辗转却去不到 对的站台
,如果漂泊是成长 必经的路牌
,你迷醒岁月中
,那贫瘠的未来
,像遗憾季节里 未结果的爱

昨晚她是我的一切
多么美的世界
却已经不见
今晚她来我的身边
含着泪的双眼
这是最后一晚
她要走远 嫁给别人
我要的一切 留在昨晚
求求你别走，我还没爱够
拉着你双手却没有用
看着你泪流，我也很难受
没了我以后别再回头
昨晚那份爱很简单
多么希望时间
能为我倒转
今晚我深爱的女孩
是否能够回来
我还在等待
她要走远 嫁给别人
我要的一切 留在昨晚
谁把你带走，我还没爱够
给我个借口我会放手
看着你泪流我也很难受
没了我以后别在回头
别在泪流

,天空失去了色彩 
,十点零六分
,你又一次匆匆地经过 
,广埠屯的K口
,那是他们相遇分别又再见的地方
,你是不是也曾在这彷徨

,九月武汉还在下雨来了好多人
,空气不冷不热像你沉默不语
,靠在青春的末尾像梧桐的落叶
,我在弘博的五楼睡到中午

,广八东路太狭窄
,装不下的心事
,想着一切就要到来
,还是没把握
,期待一次淡淡的相见 
,有很浓的咖啡
,我们是两个形状看着在重叠
,可在很多细节还是有区别

,你说一切不必牵强非如此不可
,也不知道关于未来怎样才适合
,大不了就一事无成再与世无争
,时间这样匆匆溜走又唱完一首歌

,But no one's really there
,Does that mean it's done in vain
,If no one really cares
,I'm back to acting strange

,At some point in the eighties
,Passing out his cassettes with
,The j-card that he drew oh did he ever expect it

,Fairly awkward now
,Leave the speakers loud
,When you feel self doubt
,If there's any chance
,That we'd still hang out
,We could detail dreams
,While we stare at passing clouds

,When I ask afterwards
,All message lost inbetween

,To the passing clouds
,I'll be there for you
,When you're feeling down

,If that's what you want to do
,I, I could laugh, I could laugh in your face if I want
,Oh, but I'm not going to
,When we met last week on Saturday
,I couldn't make a sentence, I couldn't even say what I meant to say
,That I want you, it doesn't hurt to say I want you, I need you
,I never thought I'd say I need you, I'll keep you

,Oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away

,Yes, yes, you're all, yes you're all that I ever desire
,Still I'll kill you in the end
,When, when it seems, when it seems that it's getting too soft
,When you lapse into a friend
,There's someone just behind the door
,So don't betray your feelings, no don't talk anymore
,Never dare to say
,That I want you, it doesn't hurt to say I want you, I need you

,Now, now we come, now we come to the end of it all
,See it squirming, almost dead
,No, you can't leave, you can't leave it to die here in pain
,You've got to stamp upon it's head
,I'll go out and you'll stay home
,Facing up to living, living on your own and I'll curse my pride

,过了很久 我的生活 仍有你在左右
,聊过夜深 也曾想你到白昼

,二十出头 可已看过多少悲欢离合
,也许你也忐忑
,也许你也失落
,也许你也背着我喝了一杯酒
,也许你也困惑
,也许你也不懂
,可是最美不过那夜和你看过的星空
,关于以后 我们闲聊时也提及了许多
,你喜欢小猫 我要养一只笨狗
,你曾说过 重庆是一座美丽的城市
,那条种满梧桐 是你走过多年的路

,如果你也坚定

,Need you on the other side
,
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river

,
,
,Feeling used
,But I'm
,Still missing you
,And I can't
,See the end of this
,Just wanna feel your kiss
,Against my lips
,And now all this time
,Is passing by
,But I still can't seem to tell you why
,It hurts me every time I see you
,Realize how much I need you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her
,I miss you when I can't sleep
,Or right after coffee
,Or right when I can't eat
,I miss you in my front seat
,Still got sand in my sweaters
,From nights we don't remember
,Do you miss me like I miss you?
,Fucked around and got attached to you
,Friends can break your heart too, and
,I'm always tired but never of you
,If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
,I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
,I type a text but then I never mind that
,I got these feelings but you never mind that
,Oh oh, keep it on the low
,You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
,If u wanted me you would just say so
,And if I were you, I would never let me go
,I don't mean no harm
,I just miss you on my arm
,Wedding bells were just alarms
,Caution tape around my heart
,You ever wonder what we could have been?
,You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
,Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
,I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
,But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,When love and trust are gone
,I guess this is moving on
,Everyone I do right does me wrong
,So every lonely night, I sing this song
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her
,All alone I watch you watch her
,Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
,You don't care you never did
,You don't give a damn about me
,Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
,She's the only thing you've ever seen
,How is it you never notice
,That you are slowly killing me
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her
,I remember when we broke up, the first time
,Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," cause like
,We hadn't seen each other in a month
,When you said you needed space. What?
,Then you come around again and say
,"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change. Trust me"
,Remember how that lasted for a day?
,I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"
,Ooh we called it off again last night
,But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
,We are never ever ever getting back together
,We are never ever ever getting back together
,You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
,But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
,I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
,Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
,Would hide away and find your piece of mind
,With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
,Oh, excuse me?
,Ooh, you called me up again tonight
,But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

,And I used to say, "Never say never"
,So she's all like,
,"Charlie, you need to come over to my house now"
,"because you need to get your Dave Matthews CDs"
,And I'm like, well
,"I don't even listen to Dave Matthews!"

,He ventured out to find a friend
,and learn about his bane
,
,For many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands
,Determined to make friends, if only they would understand
,But even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home
,His hope would disappoint him
,and he would remain alone
,But then the curse began to whisper in his ear
,And would confirm what was Amumu's biggest fear
,It pledged that never shall someone become his friend
,It pledged that he shall be alone until his end
,The sorrow and despair
,Became too much to bear
,Yeah..ah...
,
,The moment when Amumu
,realized what he had done
,Too late it was, for him, for them
,the evil curse had won
,The anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul
,And caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control

Verse 1
Spent all of my life breakin’ all the rules,
Steppin’ outta line in the streets and my school.
Can’t get enough of a good time,
Gonna live it up while I’m still alive.
Pre-chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,
Full speed ahead til I’m dead in the fast lane.
Live wire, wild fire,
I run a band where I bet I won’t fade away
Chorus
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
Verse 2
The devil may care, but I don’t give a damn,
To hell with reason, it’s all the scare.
You got the taste, I got the booze,
Life’s a vacation when there’s nothing to lose.
Pre-Chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,
Full speed ahead til I’m dead in the fast lane.
Live wire, wild fire,
I run a band where I bet I won’t fade away
Chrosu
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
Oh yeah, blow the red lights, sleep when I die,
Don’t you ever tell me to stop,
Chorus
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)

Pre-Chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,

I was an idiot in utero
Somehow missed New Mexico
Fell to earth in Baltimore I know
Now they lay case in empty rooms
Birthday cards and red balloons
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O
Empty parties filled with people I don't know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Telling lies and taking shots
Getting laid in parking lots
Getting high and getting caught, I know
All my broken paper planes
Parachutes and window panes
I'm a shooting star gone novocaine, I know
So I write to all the girly magazines
Splash my passion on the pages in between
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Rising from the afterglow
A dodo bird with polio
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I play with a rock and roll band on a subway
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays
We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away,
I know
Oh co-come on wake up the congregation
We will see the light tonight
The spark the flash the bang the bite
I know, I know, I know I know know know know know know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I could fade away in stereo
And you won't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
If they dropped a bomb on London
Swallow LA with the sea
Dislocation, dislocation
Say a prayer for Oklahoma
Say another one for me
Dislocation, dislocation

,You came and made who I am
,I remember where it all began
,so clearly
,I feel a million miles away
,still you connect me in your way
,and you created me
,something I would of never seen
,When I could only see the floor
,you made my window a door
,so when they say they don't believe
,I hope they see you in me
,After all the lights go down
,I'm just the words, you are the sound
,A strange type of chemistry
,You become a part of me
,and when I sit alone at night
,your thoughts run through me like a fire
,your the only one who knows
,who I really am
,We all wanna be somebody
,We just need a taste of who we are
,We all wanna be somebody
,We're willing to go but not that far
,We're all see through just like glass
,and we can shadder just as fast
,that light's been burned out for awhile
,I still see it every time I pass
,It was lost in the corners of my mind
,But I had a box of reasons why
,I never doubted it was there
,It just took a little time to find
,and
,I feel a million miles away
,still you connect me in your way
,and you created me
,something I would of never seen

,Why did I leave you behind?
,Guess it was too hard to climb
,
,Give me a reason
,Why would you want me to live and die
,Living a lie
,You were the answer
,All that I needed to justify

,
,Someone as beautiful as you
,Could do much better it's true
,That didn't matter to you
,I tried so hard to be the one
,It's something I couldn't do
,Guess I was under the gun
,
,Give me a reason
,Why would you want me to live and die
,Living a lie
,You were the answer
,All that I needed to justify

,So this is the end of you and me
,We had a good run and I'm setting you free
,To do as you want, to do as you please
,Without me
,Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea?
,Together we'd float so delicately
,But that was back when we could talk about anything
,
,'Cause I don't know who I am
,When you're running circles in my head
,And I don't know just who you are
,When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
,Three whole words and eight letters late
,And that would have worked on me yesterday
,We're not the same, I wish that could change
,But it can't
,
,And I'll say your name and in the same breath
,
,I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
,
,So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
,That we don't wanna believe
,'Cause I don't know who I am
,When you're running circles in my head
,And I don't know just who you are
,When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
,So it's true what they say
,If you love someone, you should set them free
,Oh, it's true what they say
,When you throw it away
,I don't know who you are
,I don't know who you are
,
,Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are

,New Kids On The Block -- Summertime
,
,
,Jones Beach 1988. Come on!
,
,Do you remember,
,Or should I rewind,
,To that summer when you caught my eye,
,I played it cool,
,The weather was hot,
,You had the beauty and the beach on lock.
,
,With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt,
,Walkin' on the beach, so pretty,
,You wasn't lookin' for a man,
,When you saw me in the sand,
,But you fell for the boy from the city.
,
,I was like, "hey, girl, can I get your number"
,I remember what you told me too,
,"Don't call after ten"
,But you know that I did,
,'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you.
,
,I think about you in the summertime,
,(Oh oh)
,And all the good times we had, baby,
,Been a few years and I can't deny,
,(Oh oh)
,The thought of you still makes me crazy,
,I think about you in the summertime,
,(Oh oh)
,I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
,You're my, my summertime.
,
,Do you remember,
,I'll never forget,
,Touchin' your body all soakin' wet,
,The water was cool,
,The feelin' was hot,
,Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked.
,
,In your strapless sundress,
,Kickin' back, no stress,
,As long as we was together,
,'Cause we were feelin' young love,
,And we couldn't get enough.
,Baby, I could reminisce forever.
,
,And now I'm like,
,Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it,
,And I wonder if you miss it too,
,Never thought it would end 'til it did,
,Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you.
,
,I think about you in the summertime,
,(Oh oh)
,And all the good times we had, baby,
,Been a few years and I can't deny,
,(Oh oh)
,The thought of you still makes me crazy,
,I think about you in the summertime,
,I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
,You're my, my summertime.
,
,Break it down.
,
,Summer ended,
,Winter started,
,It got colder,
,When we parted ways,
,(I like this part.)
,As the seasons change.
,(Bring it forward, bring it back)
,Winter melted,
,Spring I felt it,
,Summertime will never be the same,
,(Without you. My summertime.)
,My summertime.
,
,I think about you in the summertime,
,I think about you
,And all the good times we had, baby,
,We had baby
,It's been a few years and I can't deny,
,I can't deny
,The thought of you still makes me crazy,
,Makes me crazy
,I think about you in the summertime,
,I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind.
,On my mind,
,My summertime.

,Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah.

,Turn again and turn towards this time
,All she asks the strength to hold me
,Then again the same old story
,World will travel, oh so quickly
,Travel first and lean towards this time
,Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
,Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
,Watching her, these things she said
,The times she cried
,Too frail to wake this time
,Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown
,Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
,Avenues all lined with trees
,Picture me and then you start watching
,Watching forever, forever
,Watching love grow, forever
,Letting me know, forever

,Here are the young men,
,a weight on their shoulders
,Here are the young men,
,well where have they been?
,We knocked on doors
,Joy Division
,of hell's darker chambers
,Pushed to the limits,
,we dragged ourselves in
,
,Watched from the wings as
,the scenes were replaying
,We saw ourselves now as
,we never had seen
,Portrayal of the traumas and degeneration
,The sorrows we suffered
,Where have they been （4）
,
,Weary inside, now our hearts
,lost forever
,Can't replace the fear
,or the thrill of the chase
,These rituals showed up the door
,for our wanderings
,Opened and shut, then slammed
,in our face
,Where have they been （4）
,
,I took a ride down where nobody grinsto remind myself
,it's sink or swimits all over the town suicide
,A lovers mind is for nobody's sin she'll take off her clothes and jump right in
,being the dog that I am I won't hide
,But I'm too young too late too young to find what I've been looking for
,in this gutter town in this silly town
,But I'm too young too late too young to find what I've been looking for
,in this gutter town in this silly town
,I still hold onto those things that I read in a book that told me I can't win
,oh what a mess that I am
,I'm alive
,Universities painted a life that has come before me
,other guys, people that were what I am in a foreign time
,But I'm too young too late too young to find what I've been looking for
,in this gutter town in this silly town
,But I'm too young too late too young to find what I've been looking for

,
,I fell asleep with the enemy
,Can it go back to how it used to be?
,Your shadow hung in my memory
,A hand to hold, a picture to believe
,And I fall into the night again
,It took so long to be on my own
,When the morning comes I hope I'm ready for it
,And the night won't wake till we get back home
,When the morning comes I hope we're ready for it
,
,You come to me as the snow begins
,The thunder rolls, the rain, it's still, it seems
,But I fell into the night again
,It took so long to be on my own
,When the morning comes I hope I'm ready for it
,And the night won't wait till we get back home

,
So tell me what I pay for the price of freedom
No healthy survival in rooms unattached
Just trying to touch you, but never to hold you
In this burning confusion, with hands made of clay
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
In this prison of nowhere, you've played my emotions
You've stretched my condition, my head is all fire
With gates made of iron, like a lamb to the slaughter
Emotional torture is a game you enjoy
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
The importance of nothing, your own bleak conclusion
Illusion's an answer, but never the healer
And crippled in silence, the stretch of a lifetime
The power to hold me, your pleasure to gain
It's a dicey situation I have found myself in
It's a dicey situation I have found myself in
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
You've got your hand on my heart
On my heart 

作曲 : Burrows, Havas, Jones
Somewhere the blast furnace explodes
Plumes of amber in the night sky
Each explosion bounces
From horizon to horizon
From horizon... to horizon
And for a while, the slow pulse boy
Stood by the window
And let the fire sink into his skin
Again all was still
But for the empty tin
Rolling up and down a gutter
On the breeze
Then we were standing very close
I could live in the space
Between his heartbeats
Outside the blast furnace errupts again
And dark red rivers
Filled our veins with frenzy
We could tear up the floors
And find all the things we'd ever lost
And the fire burns in our jack boots
So we chase the explosions
From horizon to horizon
Wrap ourselves around the distance
For as long as we can hold
Somewhere a girl is singing
There is calm in the air
But there is greater calm than I can bear
Tomorrow the sun shines
,
,A mirage before the rain
,Silence in the air
,Your silhouette with the wreath in your hair
,A strong love that keeps us near
,No shackles on our feet
,A feeling that is pure and simple and serene
,Your whisper in my ear
,My childhood is here
,I’ve never been this happy before
,I’m lying numb and quiet
,Looking at the door
,And curtains in our room are colored by the dawn
,A simple feeling with infinite pain(x6)

酷玩乐团Coldplay英国金榜冠军曲〈Paradise〉与Top 10单曲〈Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall〉混音版由DJ杂志2011年百大DJ票选名单中分别位居第12名、第23名、第26名的Axell、Steve Angello、Sebastian Ingrosso三大DJ合体组成的瑞典超级电音劲旅「瑞典浩室黑手党Swedish House Mafia」气势如虹，联手冲上DJ杂志2011年百大DJ票选第10名，不过，这支超级电音劲旅却在2012年9月底宣布将在11月起跑，造访杜拜、印度、瑞典、德国、法国、俄罗斯、南非与美国旧金山、芝加哥、纽约、洛杉矶的「One Last Tour电音之旅」结束后回归各自的DJ岗位，消息一出，引爆抢票狂潮，就连首度开放DJ秀演出的纽约麦迪逊花园广场的门票都在开卖八分钟之内横扫一空。Swedish House Mafia在「One Last Tour电音之旅」启动前夕发行欢声雷动的电音／浩室大碟《Until Now》，首波与瑞典创作型歌手John Martin合作的造势单曲〈Don`t You Worry Child〉在2012年10月发行首周空降英国流行金榜与舞曲金榜双冠军，同时挺进全美舞曲榜第五名以及瑞典（冠军）、比利时（冠军）、苏格兰（冠军）、丹麦（亚军）、爱尔兰（亚军）、荷兰（#5）、意大利（#9）、加拿大（#10）等国流行单曲榜Top 10，音乐录像带在YouTube累积高达1330万浏览人次。Swedish House Mafia在2010年夏季以电音浩室舞曲〈One〉撼动全球舞池，挺进包括英国流行金榜第7名与全美舞曲榜第三名在内的全球11国流行单曲榜Top 10，瞬间成为舞池派对潮流中象征新世代年轻精神指标的国歌。Steve Angello与Sebastian Ingrosso在六、七岁的时候就在Sebastian父亲创立的Plumphouse唱片公司玩音乐，一起弄休闲音乐合辑，或是帮表演节目创作音乐，甚至帮瑞典主办的欧洲歌唱大赛谱写歌曲，Steve与Sebastian在2000年认识隶属于浩室音乐厂牌Sulphuric旗下的Axell，这群热爱电音与浩室舞曲的朋友一边在夜店进行电音秀，一边发表混音作品，Steve与Axell在2006年携手以Supermode之名发表取样1980年代中期的英国流行乐团Bronski Beat歌曲〈Smalltown Boy〉、〈Why?〉而成的电子舞曲〈Tell Me Why〉，Steve随后又与Sebastian以代号Buy Now发表了无数作品。Steve，Sebastian与Axell欢喜逗阵的电音旅程所释放的动能逐渐壮大，三人索性在2008年以乐迷在网络论坛上的称呼Swedish House Mafia组成浩室/电音共同体，三位DJ各自展现不同的电音风格—Steve偏向地下电子乐节奏，Axell注重电子舞曲旋律性，Sebastian象是介于两人之间的电子乐平衡木，Swedish House Mafia在2010年大放异彩，接连以〈One〉、〈Miami 2 Ibiza〉等单曲闯进英国流行金榜与全美舞曲榜TOP 10，首张专辑《Until One》也进驻英国流行金榜亚军。2012年压轴大碟《Until Now》汇聚超强电音／浩室节奏能量，有空降英国流行金榜冠军大作〈Don`t You Worry Child〉；2012年葛莱美奖最佳舞曲提名之全美舞曲榜冠军曲〈Save The World〉；与澳洲电音双人组Knife Party联手擒拿英国舞曲金榜亚军曲〈Antidote〉；取样奥斯卡电影音乐得主汉斯季默（Hans Zimmer）为电影【全面启动】所谱写的主题音乐〈Time〉而成的全美舞曲榜第三名畅销曲〈Greyhound〉；与葛莱美奖乐团OneRepublic主唱Ryan Tedder合作的英国舞曲金榜第四名畅销曲〈Calling〉。专辑中同时辑录Swedish House Mafia 操盘制作英伦摇滚名团酷玩乐团Coldplay英国金榜冠军曲〈Paradise〉与第六名单曲〈Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall〉混音版，以及英伦华丽流行乐团Florence + The Machine晋升英国金榜第五名单曲〈You Got The Love〉混音版。

Turn your face away from your god*
Nothing can save you from this.
Suck it up bitch, I'm going to fucking own you.
You're fucked.
Say your prayers, fall to your knees.
Look at this face.
There's no such thing as a god.
Motherfucker, open your eyes.
There's no such thing as a god.
I'm inflicting bloodshed upon bitches,
Just because I hate the female race.
There's no remorse.
There's no remorse in me.
I keep wanting to burn my name onto the gospel.
Or burn the Bible to hell.
Religion is a futile attempt to abstain from loosing your mind.
There's no remorse in my eyes.
Women were born to be fucked.
For some men,
The power to destroy a life
Becomes a quest for dominance.
I need to own this world.
I need to own this world!
Murder begins
Where your self-defense ends.
Look in my bloodshot eyes
And feel the presence of hell.
Your life amounts to nothing.
Lifeless slut, in love with God.
Do you believe there's a god in this lifetime?
Do you believe in God?

,As I subtly hypnotize you you're perplexed in awe of this machine.
,You pathetic and distracted waste of a creation.
,Why not open up your uninspired eyelids to the truth, look at proof of the filth you perpetuate so
,precisely.
,Intellectual decline is an angel to the disconcerting leaders of a disappearing planet as they secr
,etly conspire, to force feed you the...
,Lies I force down your fragile throat, you're led like cattle to the slaughter-couch.
,Take a seat and prepare for lobotomy.
,I'm like a skilled surgeons defective hand, oh fuck it let's all go consume.
,Bombarded with unimportant technology, fucking buy it!
,Celebrity infatuation.
,Beauty, plastic surgery, you're too fucking fat.
,Smoke this, don't smoke that, now pay us money for this pointless patch.
,SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND TUNE IN!
,Entertainment drooling from your open mouth.
,Seeding, feeding.
,My empirical static draws you closer, entertainment drooling from your open mouth.
,Breeding, feeding.
,You better get beautiful.
,To the soothing tune of misinformation.
,You better keep serving.
,Grind, sleep, grind.
,Consume and pay the...
,War led system as it marches, arms wide open, acceptant of hypocrisy.
,Led by corrupted puppeteers, choking murder.
,An uninspired hierarchy of liars sitting on thrones made of spare tamed intellect and...
,Something save us!
,Nothing can save you.
,From this corrupt...
,Shut the fuck up, watch the latest headlines cattle. Everything will be ok.
,What about the poison in our water supply, wars for oil, false flag attacks?
,Shut the fuck up now, hush why don't you go back to sleep? Everything will be ok, listen to your TV
,!
,Maybe I should just sit down and watch an episode of bullshit?
,Take a seat and watch your life unfold as you do nothing but save up for a house with a car and tha
,
,t lush car from the Ad before you curl up, tune out, DIE!
,DON'T DARE TOUCH THAT DIAL!
,So, you've fulfilled lies saturated on your lifeless corpse.
,A wad of worthless money tightly clutched in one hand.
,And in the glow of my pixelated stare, you see this program's drawing to an end.
,And I've dissected synapses and shed your dreams, they've been precisely extracted from your head.
,And you lapped up your decomposed intellect.
,Everything will be OK, I'll just sit down and watch some bullshit.
No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
(What you want me to be)
Don't give a fuck what you think
(Fuck you)
Just get the fuck away from me
(Away from me)
I swear I tried my best to ignore it all
(And walk away)
But it's too late
I want to spit the poison back in your face
No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
Don't give a fuck what you think
Just get the fuck away from me
That's the way of the world
They want to see you live on your knees
When you refuse to conform another door shuts (and)
No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
(What you want me to be)
Don't give a fuck what you think
(Fuck you)
Just get the fuck away from me
(Get the Fuck away from me)
Yeah you can beg all you want
Cause nothing is going to fucking change
You sealed your fate the day you crossed me
This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
(DO YOU HEAR ME!?)
This is my message to a dying world
(YOU PIECE OF SHIT!)
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
(RUN, RUN!)
This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

Get up.
Yeah I know you're fucking feelin me now.
And if you're with me standing out in the crowd,
Bounce.
If you got my fucking back then just say (Hell Yeah)
You're down with me and my team (Hell Yeah)
You're fucking sick of the scene (Hell Yeah)
cuz nothing is what it seems.
Let's get to the point.
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it,
You know it all, you know it all.
Turns out you know nothing at all.
You want it, you want it, you want it, you want it,
You want it all, you want it all.
But you cannot get what you want.
Tonight, I wanna see you moving from side to side.
From the front to the back,
If you're with me, then where the fuck are you at?
Nothing is what it seems.
Nothing is what it seems.
What?
If you got my fucking back then just say (Hell Yeah)
You're down with me and my team (Hell Yeah)
You're fucking sick of the scene (Hell Yeah)
cuz nothing is what it seems.
And if you're keeping it real then I'm keeping it real.
So if you're with me, then where the fuck are you at?

All the Blood from the bodies collects then irrigates through the
soil. It flows through the cracks of the earth then drips to the
demons below, just waiting to be unleashed by the blood of the chosen
Christ. His blood shall set them free. Beneath this sacred ground lies
the gate to their dimension, amidst the molten bowls of the earth.
Once the chosen blood touches to their lips the gates open; our
dimensions amalgamate, transporting them to earth to rule with me
forever. Without the chains of their translucency my flesh burns away
to reveal my true form as God. I am Belial; the serpent has shed his
skin. I have deceived the world as a servant of God. With the church I
have prepared my own thrown. It was easy to fool them all with my
disguise. As they looked into my eyes they never saw the serpent
beneath the surface, waiting for his moment to strike. I have brought
forth hell to earth just to show God what it’s worth. His kingdom
shall rot forever. I have no sympathy for God.

,
,I held you close, I think I know
,Maybe it’s time that I let you go
,Did I not show you
,That it meant as much to me as it did to you,
,I swore I’d see this through
,I could write you,
,But would you even read it?
,Not read the words but take them as truths no gimmicks,
,I could write you,
,But now I see things different.
,It's not the same between you and I.
,It's not the same.
,Shatter the pieces of your past weakness,
,You need to fail faster to allow you to beat this.
,What a ritual, what a script to unfold
,The story you were told
,Fingernails scratching words on the chalkboard,
,Gave me chills, hair stood up on my forearm
,The white noise was so hard to pick through,
,But I was still there to catch you
,Pick you up before your short fuse would get you.
,You told me that I would see you again,
,Whether in this life or through a future kin
,If I could have only one wish, I would ask to be stronger...stronger.
,Stronger
,When love finds its way
,It finds its way back to you
,When love finds its way
,It finds its way back to you.
,Now I see the picture,
,I’ve got this special feeling.
,Washes over like a perfect memory, but
,I know to control my mind,
,Before it turns and controls me
,When love finds its way
,It finds its way back to you.
,When love finds its way
,It finds its way back to you.
,
,Push your care, push your burdens aside
,Erase everything inside and leave just one thing on your mind.
,You only live once so just go fucking nuts!
,Go!
,Live life hard
,Live life hard
,You only get one shot
,So shoot!
,With every breath you take you're dying
,With every step we take we're falling apart
,If we only had one chance we'd breathe
,Let's take the chance right now and scream
,You only live one life
,For a very short time
,So make every second divine
,Go!
,Live life hard
,Live life hard
,Are you still breathing?
,It's your heart that's beating inside
,That keeps us alive
,And for the very first time
,We're pushing aside to surrender
,Everything that I see in my eyes
,Except for the one thing on my mind
,That I am alive
,For the very first time!
,For the first time
,Pushing worry aside
,For the first time
,Pushing worry aside
,Erase everything inside
,Erase everything inside
,Erase everything inside and leave just one thing
,You only get one shot!
,You only live once so just go fucking nuts
,You only live once so just go fucking nuts

,It bleeds! It breathes!
,What stands before us, is not a machine
,It breathes, it will bleed and it (will) dream!
,(Scream)
,Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
,And a mouth that attempts to speak, it attempts to lie
,Only murmurs, collapse from its jaws
,And a world, a world without,
,A world without you
,But I rise, the dead will pride
,It breathes, beyond this life,
,So sleep, sleep among us, hesitate no more
,En...tomb-men...of-a-ma...chine (entombment of a machine)
,We kneel and we plead for no mourning ahead of us,
,With only delayed movements, from its figure, we all begin to strain
,Entombment of a machine
,Entombment of a machine
,What stands before us is not a machine
,What stands before us is not a machine
,My legs weaken at the site of this damaged program,
,This program kept you breathing, it kept you alive
,These circuits diffused once more
,Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
,Only murmurs collapse from its scream
,Entombment of a machine
,But I saw it die.
,But I saw it die
,But I saw It dead.
,But I saw it die.
,I saw it die
,I watched it DIE!

  I will not relent no, no
 Never live with defeat never falter
 This like the air that I breathe
 I will not choke on failure
 
 I am a mortal man
 But I'm not fallen
 I'm not broken
 I am a mortal man But I'll
 Hold tight to my beliefs
 
 I have suffered defeat, pain, loss
 Still I push to the edge, never falter
 For this cement my beliefs
 I'll will not choke on failure
 
 I will not relent

A son born of Tiamat and Apsu
His mother’s dissected corpse carefully arranged to create the universe.
Marduk, patron God of Babylon.
Marduk is aging.
A city in decline.
Anu Impregnates the Earth.
Birth seven Gods.
Decree their destinies to serve as the weapons of Erra.
The ruins of a city.
The vicious Sebitti.
Fear.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living things.
Fill their hearts with dragon’s venom.
Devastation to Marduk and Babylon.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates. Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
May they lay low living things.
The Igigi will glorify your name.
Mountain peaks bow their heads in terror.
The gods, your Fathers, praise your valor.
Kings kneel beneath your feet.
Countries bring you their tribute.
Demons flee.
Rolling seas hear and stir up.
People are frightened into controlling the noise.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates.
Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
Devastate the city of the gods.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living the things.
The Igigi will glorify your Name.
The Gods, your Fathers, will praise your valor.

,will you remember me
,as the one from the trees
,when the forests used to sing
,or when i locked myself
,in the heart of the wood
,and threw away the key
,you just kept giving yourself away
,a gift to cherish until piece by piece
,you laid before the roots of time
,day by day the nights swallow the sun,
,and with every night
,the more you gave your sadness came undone
,you just kept slipping through the cracks
,of my fingertips
,i only hope that you remember me
,as the one from the trees
,when the forests used to sing
,instead of when i locked myself
,in the heart of the wood
,and threw away the key
,you're not desire
,you're just a fucking widow
,weaving webs among the woods
,i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
,i'll show you the world of the dead
,there you were smiling into the night
,i watched you sing for hours on end
,we're telltale spiders spinning webs and singing songs
,sharing your stories with the moon and the trees
,with a world which strung you along i've shut you out
,i don't like your stories anymore
,they always end so fucking sad
,fuck
,i've turned my back
,i've turned my back
,on you for good
,just keep smiling into the night
,i watched you pass me by
,every night you died
,with a smile on your face
,in my dreams you wept blood
,from your eyes
,just keep smiling into the night
,my beautiful bride
,just keep smiling into the night
,my beautiful bride
,i fell for your bleeding crimson eyes
,just so you, just so you know
,i'll always remember you
,as the telltale spider
,when darkness crept into our days
,sharing stories with the world
,until piece by piece you gave your heart away
,you're not desire
,you're just a fucking widow
,weaving webs among the woods
,i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
,i'll show you the world of the dead
,i hate sad stories they always end the same
,i'll never forget how the forests wept
,when you gave yourself away
,No longer on your side,
,No longer within your prison
,No longer here to speak with a positive spin on society
,So sick of your politics,
,so sick of your fading religions
,So sick of the endless lies that ignite and divide
,it's homicide
,This is the reason your walls are coming down
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Torch it all;
,Torch it all
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Watch it burn
,The writing's on the wall
,Watch it burn
,So tired of your ignorance,
,So tired of your passing trends
,So tired of your predictive script,
,You're all dead inside
,You're all dead inside
,It was supposed to be better than this
,Can you imagine why?
,The path of no return has killed all reason to believe
,A paradox in the vow you've taken.
,Engulfed in your own world
,The tried and true are now unspoken.
,God save you all
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Torch it all; Torch it all
,Did you even hear a word I said?

Another day is slipping away from us.
Their kingdoms can? t outlast the hopelessness we know.
We? re barricaded in and we? re desperate.
Eternity will never claim me from my throne.
This is my last chance to pull out my teeth,
Pull out all my teeth from my own tongue.
As we push on... push on.
Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK.And now 
I see what kept us from making it.
We? re holding to these deadweight hearts as we all sink.
To me their human pride does not exist, (does not exist, does not exist)
To me their human pride does not exist at all.
This is my last chance to pull out my teeth,
Pull out all my teeth from my own tongue.
And what we had (PUSH ON) was always this (PUSH ON).
Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK...Aim for the whites of their eyes.
Aim for the whites of their eyes.
Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.The weakest hands have destroyed everything we worked for.
Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.The weakest hands have destroyed everything we worked for.
As we PUSH 
ON.As WE P
USH ON.Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath...and start making your mark.
Broke and relentless.start making your mark
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK...Push on.
Push on.
Hold your breath, baby. 
We have to make our hearts sit still. 
Hold your tongue, honey, 
The things we know could unleash hell. 
Patch me up, my skin is so tight around my chest, my heart is leaping out. 
I feel my imagination playing like a movie in my eyes, 
It’s got me firmly by the sleeve. 
Hold your breath baby, we have to make our hearts sit still. 
I swear they’re beating so loud that anyone could tell 
We’re keeping every thought to ourselves in case we mention how we feel. 
Hold your tongue honey, the things we know could unleash hell. 
I see your imagination shimmer in the way that you move, 
Hardly afraid that anyone could see. 
We’re caught up in the moment, it’s got us now, and you’ve got me by the collar. 
What are you waiting for? 
Pull me in. 
We saw the warning signs too late, and we’re too far gone. 
Please don’t remind me of reality now, 
I’ve been pretending for days by now, 
My god, it must have been days.
,
,It's your turn right now, let me see your steps
,Let me feel your hesitation
,Nothing ventured, nothing gained
,We know the reproach to yourself
,All your reflections as an open secret
,All your mistakes as a success
,Your tears as the pitiful disport
,Your decisions make us win
,Follow the guide we gave you
,Don't look upward, there's nothing above you
,Your eyes aren't qualified
,Your memory is your future
,Can you remember your end?
,We, we are your faith and your fear
,We are your inspiration and your overload
,You're all equal
,This is your reality, your veiled sight
,You can never see
,You can put the blame on us
,You can put the blame on us
,"It's all about your personal interpretation of what you're looking at."
,I see you try to grow with your scars
,But you fail again and again
,You can put the blame on us
,This is what, this is what we expect
,This makes your life so much easier
,Just close your eyes, follow blindly
,In your deepest dreams you can see us
,In your lonely hours you can feel us
,In your lonely hours you can feel us
,(You can feel us, you can feel us)
,This prison was built for you
,You are not ready for the outside
,Maybe you will never be
,Maybe you will never see
,Nothing is more constant than change
,
,So why, why don't you change within?
,Positions won't change
,As long as you can't see the point
,Till then we will keep observing you...

,Put it on a necklace

,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all

,Until I learn

I
Brian walks home and cries into a pillow
Boiling in anger then softening in sorrow
Waking up next day carry on with fear
Shuffling along in the whiteness of evil

He was told that hope would keep him sane
But its hope that gives him all the pain
There are screams you hear and screams you don’t
The world is quiet but it isn’t kind
They push for an answer but the question is blind

And as an instinct to survive
He finds a new way to exist
The more poison pours out from his wounds
The brighter he shines
Until all his cuts become unstoppable fountains
Pouring out not pain but immense pleasure
He’s become one of his kind

II
You created me
out of confusion, raw panic, disease-ridden thoughts
Vulnerable like a balled up infant
But now I'm growing stronger
and stronger
and stronger

I am the knife you swing 
I am the screams you cry
I am the blood you shed
I am what helps you survive

I'm in the drugs you take
I'm in the pain you feel
I'm in the air you breath
I am what keeps you alive

I am invisible
I am undeniable
I am uncontrollable
I am inside, inside!

I am not one of them
I will be all of them
I will be everywhere
I will spread like a fire

to end your torture to earn your life
Run! Run! Run!

It's burning up your legs, your thighs, your chest,
your head, your hair, your face, your whole-
consume me!

III
Sickly sweet toxic all pouring out of my system
Deformed, unusual, tragic, alive

I warned you about what I could do to you
I warned you about I what I could do

I am free from the alien loneliness
I am free from your endless prejudice
I am free from unwanted affections
I am free from a crooked box you called family
I am free

,Look a little tongue-tied
,Sounds a little cross-eyed
,Fast approaching midnight
,We're locked out
,We're fast approaching midnight
,So, you take a little me
,And I take a little you
,We're all part of the century
,Hold me down now, hold me down
,A bitter disappointment
,And I was restless, I was restless
,You're winning me over
,You're winning me over
,Can't take my eyes off you

Old machinery's broken down
There's no new past there's no new sound
What would you do if they crumbled to the ground
Wake up you must be dreaming
Changes in our lives
We'll make it in the end
Machinery's broken in two
What are we to do?
Where were you when the day caved in
It seems the streets were the place to be
Something quite disturbing filled the air
Wake up you must be dreaming (what an uneasy feeling)
Machine fell down and smashed the ground
People cried for miles around
Well that's what someone said
Wake up you must be dreaming (a quite uneasy feeling)
What are we to do?
作词 : Modern English
Dreaming in a chair, contemplating
The times gone by - exhilarating, entertaining
Reaching out with tenderness
Scenes of laughter framed in reminiscence
Catch a smile for stormy days and sad occasions
Moving targets and camera shy
The moon is dark and shadowed
The sun keeps ticking by
Silence and solitude
No one left to cry
No one left to cry
Standing in front a mirror
I draw and pinch my skin
Tired eyes portray reality
A face of lines which melt in the world
I am oak
I am oak
I am oak
I am oak
作词 : Grey, Mason
I will push you
Then i'll pull you
If i twist you then
I'll turn you
When you stretch me
Reinvent me
Upside down
And inside out
Like elastic
We're expanding
It's never ending
It can hurt you
You could kill me
Is it inside
Could it be
I will push in
You will break me
Like elastic
I've read your books
And seen your films
I've lived this life
And tried everything
But i don't know anything
Concentrated
Anticipated
Confirmation of inspiration
And i don't know anything
I've seen your face
Your state of grace
I've watched this world
And how it turns
And i don't know anything
Concentrated
Anticipated
Confirmation of inspiration
And i don't know anything
Here we go again
London is insane
Confusion in my brain
Here we go again
Pleasure turns to pain
A disposable refrain
It's feeling very strange
Here we go again
Here we go again
Its always the same
Nothing seems to change
Here we go again
As the television fades
The cloud it turns to rain
Money to be made
Here we go again
Here we go again

,一张破旧的地图和未曾走完的路途
,总有一些感觉对你是特殊
,如同浪花经过又看着它渐渐远走
,就要回去起程的地方

,可以自由的呼吸在感觉音乐的时候
,我的心啊像是被放飞的风筝不知道飘向什么地方
,那道背影来自傍晚的霞光永远的消失在那黄昏的海洋

,You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
,I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
,I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
,That's all that matters for the time being
,But obviously, assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
,I’ma make it if it kills me
,Let’s see how far I can take it with this music
,I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
,Sorry for sloppy writing
,The pen in my hand’s shaking, please excuse me
,Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
,If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
,With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
,As I’m using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm
,Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
,For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
,Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
,Love, daddy
,Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup
,I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
,I'm sorry, we're alone
,I wrote my chapter
,You'll turn the page when I'm gone
,I hope you'll sing along
,This is your song
,I just want you to know that I ain't scared
,Whatever it takes to raise you
,I'm prepared to do whatever
,December 1st, 1996, (to do whatever) dear Hailie
,You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
,Her beautiful smile,
,But your ears are the same size as mine are
,Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
,But you'll grow into 'em baby
,I'm on the grind now
,I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
,While I'm tryna keep the lights on
,Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
,I just keep steering
,I'm gonna turn into someone
,I haven't the slightest
,Clue what I'm gonna do if it falls through
,You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
,My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
,They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
,Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
,I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
,Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
,Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
,I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
,I'm sorry, we're alone
,I wrote my chapter
,You'll turn the page when I'm gone
,I hope you'll sing along
,This is your song
,I just want you to know that I ain't scared
,Whatever it takes to raise you,
,I'm prepared to do whatever
,December 24th, 2007, (to do whatever) dear Hailie
,Now if you found these letters,
,I guess I better try to explain
,A lot's happened in between 'em, since I rised to this fame
,I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
,This game is crazy,
,I wanted to claim my love for you but damn
,I never knew it'd be like this
,If I did I wouldn't have done it
,You ain't asked for none of this shit
,Now you're being punished?
,Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
,I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
,I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
,One-hundred percent finished
,Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
,Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
,That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
,And, if things should worsen,
,Don't take this letter I wrote as a goodbye note
,'Cause your dad's at the end of his rope
,I'm sliding down a slippery slope
,Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
,Love dad
,Shit, I don't know

,If I could rewind time like a tape, inside a boombox
,One day for every pill, or percocet that I ate
,Cut down on the valium, that'll hurt everything
,But death is turning so definite, wait
,They got me all hooked up to some machine
,I love you, being, didn't want you to know I was struggling
,Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
,Just heard that nurse say,
,My liver and kidneys aren't functioning
,Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
,It's arrivederci, same nurse,
,Just heard say they're unplugging me
,And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
,Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
,And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
,But, girls, you can just open 'em,
,Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
,Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
,I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
,I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
,My vocal cords won't permit me,
,I scream, but it's not allowed
,You put your arm around mama, the karma, wow
,I just thought about the aisle,
,I'll never get to walk us down
,Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns
,It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
,I've got so much more to do, and Proof, I'm truly sorry
,If I let you down, but this tore me in two
,The thought of no more me and you
,You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
,Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
,So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
,I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
,By pictures all on my walls
,And I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
,That image burned in my brain of you on the table
,Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
,God, why did you take him?
,I'm tryna keep his legacy alive,
,But I'm dying, where's Nathan?
,Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
,Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
,I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
,And I know you'll never forget me,
,Just don't get sad when remembering
,And, little bro, keep making me proud
,You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
,And when you're exchanging those sacred vows,
,Just know that if I could be there
,I would and should you ever see parenthood,
,I know you'll be good at it
,Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
,I actually learnt a lot from you,
,You taught me what not to do
,And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
,To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
,Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
,And I can feel my soul leave my body
,And float across the room
,Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
,Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
,Girls, please don't get upset,
,I see them cheeks soaking and wet
,As you squeeze hold of my neck,
,So forcibly, don't wanna let
,Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
,With every second, each closer to death
,But suddenly, I feel my heart begin to beat slow
,Then a breath, machines go
,Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
,I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, find an escape
,Make a beeline, try and awake
,From this dream, I need to re-find
,My inner strength, to remind me
,Even if a steep climb I must take
,To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape
,(I don't want it)
,I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
,One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
,I'm hanging it up, fuck it
,Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
,That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
,And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
,I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
,Shred these old letters I wrote
,All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
,I'm proud to be back, I'm 'bout to, like a rematch
,Outdo Relapse
,With Recovery, Mathers LP2
,Help propel me to victory laps
,Gas toward them and fast forward the past
,Consider the last four minutes as
,The song I'd have sang to my daughters
,If I'd have made it to the hospital
,Less than two hours later, but I fought it
,Came back like a boomerang on 'em
,Now a new day is dawning, I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning
,Now I know

,嘿~
,一路向着梦中的山野
,迎着不停摇摆的世界
,-----------------------------------------------
,谁知道谎言有多少外衣 谁知道记忆该如何抹去
,谁知道那架飞机去了哪里 谁知道明天会发生什么
,有人说摇滚已经死了 有人在默默地唱
,一路向着梦中的山野 迎着不停摇摆的世界
,时下里所谓成功的定义 就如同一个芬芳的屁
,谁做的这个伟大的局 让人们演着那真诚的戏
,若一天摇滚真的死了 就让它随风而去
,待到鲜花烂漫了山野 祭那丢盔卸甲的热血

,那里会是什么样子呢？
,我的爱人在那里
,那里是什么样子呢？
,一切都是未知的，

,失去的即将不存在意义了，
,我的躯体不会再有意义了，
,我的思想也没有意义了，

,人生的路途 会有差异分歧
,不同地点驻足 拍下各异写真集
,有时被缠绕 有时被分离
,我如梵高般悲戚而你更像达芬奇
,我们都需要粉笔 尽情去涂抹
,不在乎是否沉底品尝殉情的苦果
,这是一种状态 可以理解为寻羊
,在天际中云翔 最终战胜了群强
,忘记现实吧瓷 别限制了词

作曲 : 茶米
作词 : 茶米
很多的關係 都有很多問號   一個不小心別怪燙手就是拿捏不好
一開始的姊妹到 後來的兄弟 到了結局居然跨越了朋友這段距離
男人的天性任誰都埋不住曖昧   因此同樣的簡訊 也同˙樣傳兩遍
我不能怪老天安排這什麼緣分  只怪自己腳色沒演好因此被扣了分
分的分 恨的恨  我怪罪在夢醒那時分  我還是不是你眼中那最壞的男人
吵得吵 找不到  第一次遇見時的單純  當下哭笑不得時的那份天真
守護我的天使  就像我背後的翅膀  少了一片就是不能夠來成雙
心冷像秋葉隨風吹東飄西又止  我愛顧我愛就藏在心中無人能取代

sexting on the phone oh damn got me  feeling lonly you fire it up and that's what up i can't get enough ( i can't get enough) 
so remain peep's to my phone (to my phone) forgive attend to drop me crazy  (drop me crazy)
you fire it up and that's what up i can't get enough ( i can't get enough)

我開始學會不再依賴哪一方對哪一方的矜持    當孤單給了彼此才領悟過的日子
盼不到 你那冷豔的微笑  看不到 微笑時微揚嘴角   
下一秒 只剩下眼神對眼神˙的對持   我知道這 玩笑開大了就剩下一張白紙
我傷了你的心 那痛卻滲透到我這裡  你剪了這段情是因為模糊的分不清
你要我放下的包袱就是你對我在情上的報復   我卻還要餓著空腹來消化互相的痛楚
別再問我該不該  任誰躲也躲不開  我依舊還會 想念那一夜你在不在
情感上的分配  這責任是要怪誰   暈頭轉向盲目的祈禱別在為誰套牢 
搞不好你我他又在轉角處那遇到  難道要比陌生人還陌生的走掉
 
sexting on the phone oh damn got me  feeling lonly 
you fire it up and that's what up i can't get enough ( i can't get enough)
so remain peep's to my phone (to my phone) forgive attend to drop me crazy  (drop me crazy)
you fire it up and that's what up i can't get enough ( i can't get enough)

該忘了吧  告訴自己該長大 
 徘徊在情字上的感情       開始有了分岔
回頭望那道傷  我想是我給的吧  
這觸感很清楚  表達的像迷霧  下一位情人會感謝我的辜負 才造就你要的幸福
徹底覺悟在那殘影深處   過客的角度  是轉身後的殘酷 
抉擇的錯誤  被擱淺的旅途  冰冷的雙手摟著你還叫我別哭
 紅了眼又哽咽  卻盼不到歸宿   瀰漫中遊走在沒有結局 的束腹
如果愛可以再重來  我想我 對你的愛會加倍不減半
  
sexting on the phone oh damn got me  feeling lonly 
you fire it up and that's what up i can't get enough ( i can't get enough)

,我的朋友都在鬼混 我在家里冲着奶粉
,她吃饭吃了一身吃完了还在地上打滚
,我这老板老爸一家之主现在成了什么身份
,有个小不点儿骑在我头上拉屎烦不烦人
,前一秒还在睡觉 后一秒来回乱跳
,我这中年人的小心脏怎么可能受得了
,笑起来可爱模样真想把她一口吃掉

,全家人都吃外卖 就她吃有机蔬菜
,外面下着大雨我开车去佳世客买菜
,不管什么手机手表IPad拿起来就摔
,音乐响起来就嗨 停下来就搞破坏
,她的工作就是玩儿我的工作就是陪她一起玩儿
,我的家里已经全部改装成了儿童乐园儿
,晚上睡觉打呼噜就被赶出屋我睡在沙发垫儿
,连梦都做不好第二天起来还要刷碗儿
,我是儿童小灵通 哄孩子我最通
,换尿布用不了5秒钟就像是一阵风

,周围的气氛让我觉得有点喘不过气
,周围的气是**可是使用的顾客过亿
,周围是气球可除了八卦他们报导个屁
,周围都是些想出名但是浪得虚名的mc
,周围的坏情绪 我只想带耳机
,找一个舒服的大躺椅 写些心里的melody
,就不想回信息 心跳紧跟着beat
,找回自己的感觉哪种药都没得比
,不管脑袋里在动 还是脑子里做梦
,我们需要躺下冥想 因为这身体太重
,因为这生活太冲 像边跑边喝脉动
,不想再冲动的我得清楚目标后再动
,当我回到我的房里坐上我的躺椅
,闭上眼睛直接上升身体在我脚底
,飞到高空看着人群好比小小蚂蚁
,迷失宇宙不知到底这是哪里
,当我坐上我的躺椅 坐上我的躺椅
,闭上眼睛坐上火箭直接冲破房顶
,当我坐上我的躺椅 坐上我的躺椅
,feel like montana 想要赚点big money
,当我坐上我的躺椅 坐上我的躺椅
,my ex girl想上来但是我不会再让你
,当我离开我的躺椅 嘴巴慢慢扬起
,我会试着一个个实现我梦中的场景
,wow 醒来后的我发现一身疲惫全无
,回想刚才的神游仿佛是身体悬浮
,进入了自我的世界远离了利益和权术
,发现了和平与爱是我拥有的全部
,这是我身体的元素 也是我困惑的缘故
,曾经我一心只想登顶没心欣赏沿路
,现在放慢了脚步 等待更多人加入 这旅途
,像徐福 踏上一片新大陆
,在那有着盯着炼丹炉写书的吴承恩
,摘着草的阿凡提和教着书的胡先生
,还有好多神仙姐姐住在我的神仙村
,我们围在一起比比憋的那口谁先喷
,ring lingling突然我手机电话就响起
,yo 蒋几 他问我7号有没有档期
,打开电视机放着太空漫游2001
,做上这躺椅继续漫游2017

,HMM 还记得第一次遇见的场景
,回家后没多久就开始不停不停想你
,都说女生喜欢自己被捧在手心
,所以我超速奔弛跨过层层陷阱
,冲破障碍 发过誓
,制造浪漫 也有争执
,谁在感情里 又没有过幼稚
,想过未来所以每一步都认真尝试
,很多话难说出口所以这首歌这一次
,发生意外的时候你一直陪着我没离开
,回家路上我泪眼朦胧觉得你很辛苦
,只希望你和我每一天都充实美满
,我为你传递茶米油盐 生活冷暖都领悟
,时间说长不长 说短不短
,没什么麻烦不麻烦 简单不简单
,每次见你的前一天 我就开始期盼
,只要你在身边我就会心安
,oh baby baby 说晚安 别再让自己心里烦 ohh

,简单的习惯 晚安 baby baby 就心安
,面朝大海 春暖花开
,希望你驻足 带上音符 眺望海岸
,注视前方的路 穿越昼夜或明暗
,love yourself其他都放下一切都不管
,我也坚持的走上这条坚实的路
,自己舔舐着伤口修复偏失的度
,炼试着所有无法辨识的雾 编写故事
,留下你的酷
,难过 怎么不难过
,希望睡前道声晚安 或许不能说
,以为甜言蜜语就能把僵局打破
,刚刚发生下一秒就想着该怎么做
,可能你累了 该睡了
,多穿点 别感冒了
,照顾好自己的胃
,别再轻易旷课了
,没有我在的时候 一定按时吃饭
,别让我担心 good night love u.晚安

,It might not be the right time
,I might not be the right one
,But there's something about us I want to say
,Cause there's something between us anyway
,
,I might not be the right one
,
,It might not be the right tine
,But there's something aboutus I've got to do
,
,Some kind of secret i will share with you
,
,I need you more than anything in my life
,I want you more than anything in my life
,
,I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
,
,I love you more than anyone in my life
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

,I let it fall, my heart,
,And as it fell you rose to claim it.
,It was dark and I was over,
,Until you kissed my lips and you saved me.
,My hands they're strong, but my knees were far too weak, to
,stand in your arms without falling to your feet,
,But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew.
,All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
,And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win.
,But I set fire to the rain,
,Watched it pour as I touched your face,
,well, it burned while I cried,
,Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
,It might not be the right time
,I might not be the right one
,But there's something about us I want to say
,Cause there's something between us anyway.
,When I lay with you I could stay there,
,Close my eyes, feel you here forever,
,You and me together, nothing is better!
,Cause there's a side to you that I never, never knew,
,All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
,And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win.
,But I set fire to the rain,
,Watched it pour as I touched your face,
,well, it burned while I cried,
,Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
,I need you more than anything in my life
,I want you more than anything in my life
,I'll miss you more than anyone in my life

LET ME TAKE A SELFIE LET ME TAKE A SELFIE
,When Jason was at the table
,I kept on seeing him look at me while he was with that other girl
,Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
,Because he was totally texting me all night last night
,and I don't know if it's a booty call or not
,Sooo... like what do you think?
,Did-Did you think that girl was pretty?
,How did that girl even get in here?
,Did you see her?
,She's so short and that dress is so tacky
,Who wears cheetah?
,It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing Summertime Sadness?
,After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
,I really need one
,But first, LET ME TAKE A SELFIE
,Can you guys help me pick a filter?
,I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
,I wanna look tanned
,What should my caption be?
,I want it to be clever
,How about "Livin' with my bitches, Hashtag LIVE"
,I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
,Do you think I should take it down?
,LET ME TAKE ANOTHER SELFIE
,Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
,What a creep
,Is that guy sleeping over there?
,Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
,That's so ratchet..
,That girl is such a fake model
,She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
,Who goes out on Mondays?
,OK, let's go take some shots
,Oh no (uh), I feel like I'm gonna throw up
,Oh wait, nevermind I'm fine
,Let's go dance
,There's no vodka at this table
,Do you know anyone else here?
,Oh my god, Jason just texted me
,Should I go home with him?
,I GUESS I TOOK A GOOD SELFIE

,三分天定 七分打拼
,演好自己的节目
,嘿嘿 look at me
,我出身平凡没得好命
,嘿嘿 不说勒些
,再大的困难我自己搞定
,这个世界千变万化
,就像是座魔方大厦
,每天醒来事情太多了

,从来不信命 我只信我自己
,生活要开心 打消所有顾虑

,为了生活反反复复
,黑眼圈也越来越多
,为了挣钱他不管不顾
,其实没得必要那么的忙
,给自己放个假到处去逛
,开心从不需要哪个允许
,好运锦鲤时刻在你身旁
,担心的事情太多 总抱怨收获太少
,挖心思一直在摸 睡很晚起的太早
,宝剑锋从磨砺出 梅花香自苦寒来
,车到山前必有路 有路必有好运来
,就是好运 gai 还有好运海
,听完这首歌要你好运来
,好运 gai 加上好运海

,在同源染色体上的等位基因分离
,非同源染色体上的符合自由组合定律
,你数染色体要数几个着丝粒
,姐妹染色单体分开就不能再叫单体
,间期前Ⅰ中Ⅰ联会在哪个时期（在前Ⅰ这里开始）
,每个四分体有几个染色体和单体（1个四分体=一对同源染色体=2条染色体=4条染色单体）
,经过了整个中期Ⅰ联会的同源染色体
,在赤道板的两侧排列整齐
,当染色体被纺锤丝拉向两极
,后Ⅰ就开始自由组合和分离
,染色单体在S 期出现前期核膜跟核仁消失不见
,第四个时期后缩短螺旋形态大小中期依然清晰可见
,后期染色单体消失不见变成两条染色体分向两边
,分裂前后染色体数不变那是有丝分裂的特点周期会重演
,减数分裂末期Ⅰ同源染色体已分离
,细胞在前Ⅱ时期分到两个次级里面
,精母数会均等分离卵母产生第一极体
,所以雌（♀）配子是雄（♂）的四分之一
,当图文里只剩下奇数染色体
,周期就成了减数第二次前期
,我给你的爱写在中Ⅱ里赤道板上排着一行着丝粒
,其实后Ⅱ很像有丝后期区别是前者没有同源染色体
,我给你分析减二的末期相同的配子来自同个次级
,互补配子来自同个初级减数分裂两次只复制一次
,我感到很疲倦那么多的知识点
,害怕记不住关键是没时间
,萨顿说染色体理论之前孟德尔还在用豌豆做实验
,摩尔根用果蝇实验发现染色体上基因竟然清晰可见
,减数分裂发生在受精前所以两代间染色体数不变
,用基因文字刻下了永远那一份大前年的试卷一年年重演
,别在考试前才在花时间

,有些事我都已忘记
,但我现在还记得
,在一个晚上我的母亲问我
,今天怎么不开心
,我说在我的想象中有一双滑板鞋
,与众不同最时尚跳舞肯定棒
,整个城市找遍所有的街都没有
,她说将来会找到的时间会给我答案
,星期天我再次寻找依然没有发现
,一个月后我去了第二个城市
,这里的人们称它为魅力之都
,时间过的很快夜幕就要降临
,我想我必须要离开
,当我正要走时我看到了一家专卖店
,那就是我要的滑板鞋
,我的滑板鞋时尚时尚最时尚
,回家的路上我情不自禁
,摩擦  摩擦
,在这光滑的地上摩擦
,月光下我看到自己的身影有时很远有时很近
,感到一种力量驱使我的脚步
,有了滑板鞋天黑都不怕
,一步两步一步两步 一步一步似爪牙
,似魔鬼的步伐
,摩擦 摩擦
,我给自己打着节拍
,这是我生命中美好的时刻
,我要完成我最喜欢的舞蹈
,在这美丽的月光下在这美丽的街道上
,我告诉自己这是真的这不是梦
,一步两步一步两步 一步一步似爪牙
,似魔鬼的步伐
,摩擦 摩擦
,在这光滑的地上摩擦

,我用尽一生一世 来将你供养
,只期盼你停住 流转的目光
,请赐予我无限爱 与被爱的力量
,让我能安心在菩提下 静静的观想
,我用尽一生一世 来将你供养
,人世间有太多的 烦恼忧伤
,苦海中飘荡着你 那旧时的模样
,一回头发现 早已踏出了红尘万丈

,Then say hello to the brush fire, baby
,You gotta take it from me, I’m gonna take it from you
,Say hello to the good times
,And say hello to the sun
,They’re sitting back on an empire
,While the world lays back, puts a kid behind that gun
,If we crash this time
,They got machines to keep us alive
,When the mixtape plays
,Choke down the words with no meaning
,I stopped bleeding three years ago
,While you keep screaming for revolution
,Me and my surgeons and my street walking friends
,We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead
,Say hello to the program
,We’re gonna give it for free
,Hook up the veins the antibodies
,Got it with the disease, we’re gonna give it to you
,Say goodbye to the good times
,You’re loading up with the fame
,You’re dressing up like a virus
,But the words get lost when we all look the same
,If we crash this time

,While the army wives
,Choke down the war with no meaning
,I stopped bleeding three years ago
,While you keep screaming for revolution
,Because rebellion's not a t-shirt you sell
,You keep your money and I’ll see you in hell
Let's shake this town, baby, come with me
I need a little loving company
Come on now, I know where we can go
This is the time to stay out all night
I've got a fire like a heavenly light
Come on, baby, well, let's take a drive
Come on, baby, let's do it right
Time to dance in the magic light of the desert moon
Let's lay it down under a cactus tree
Give a little loving ecstasy
Come on now it's time to go
Little baby, you're a beautiful sight
I've got the love and we have the night
Come on, baby, it's time to fly
Come on, baby, let's do it right
Time to dance in the magic light of the desert moon
Come on, honey, let's get it right
Make romance in the magic light of the desert moon
Come on, baby, let's do it right

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in 
AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers
Of some quiet conversation
She's coming in twelve-thirty flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars
That guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old
Forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in 
AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing
For some solitary company
I know that 
I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises
Like Olympus above the 
SerengetiI seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that 
I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in 
AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

,When your love of life is an empty beach
,Don't cry
,Don't cry
,When your enemy has you in his reach
,Don't die
,Don't die
,When is painful to express the things you feel inside
,When it hurts to share because they're bare and real so real
,So when everyday is judgement day I won't pray don't pray
,When there's none to share that empty chair well ok okey
,Chorus
,When you get to the bottom you're near the top
,The shit turns into chocolate drops
,The shit turns into chocolate drops
,The shit turns into chocolate drops
,Drops
,So fly so fly
,So fly so fly
,When your love of life is an empty beach

,When you get to the bottom you're near the top

,因为你还没有出现

,风从海面吹来 吹来我的期盼
,你就迎面走过来带着花海开在我无人的岸
,风从沙漠吹来 吹来我的自哀
,寂寞的车开出你那片戈壁 穿过我的荒原
,那咿呀娜鲁湾 那咿呀 娜鲁湾 那咿呀呼嘿
,那咿呀鲁湾 那咿呀 那呀呼嘿
,那咿呀鲁湾 那咿呀 那呀呼
,我满眼都是甜蜜
,风从孤岛吹来 吹得见日云开
,我骑着小鹿到此时奔波不停 以跑了一万公里
,风从林海吹来 吹得迷雾退散
,我又疼又痒酥酥麻麻沙沙作响刺在你的心上
,那咿呀娜鲁湾 那咿呀 娜鲁湾 那咿呀呼嘿
,那咿呀鲁湾 那咿呀 那呀呼嘿
,那咿呀鲁湾 那咿呀 那呀呼
,你满眼都是美丽
,我就站在浩瀚无垠青山水秀蓝天白云上面
,看繁星坠落在人间光与你连成线
,空无一人树木葱郁但却聒噪的林间
,我们初次相见
,我们只是寒暄
,我们相视一笑
,我们快乐无边

,在我心上，留下的枪伤
,到阴天都还会痛呢
,用杜冷丁救场，药效却消亡
,麻醉不等于，遗忘
,用纯洁去伪装，用信任去埋葬
,伪造爱情的不在场
,宣告死亡，草草收场
,留下一把怀疑的枪
,我看见天是蓝的云是白的我是哭的你是笑的
,梦着不如醒着
,我看见人群聚了人群散了歌声起了乐句终了
,爱了不如算了
,犀牛已疯狂地扑向那支枪
,让子弹射入他的胸膛
,枪声回荡，在草原之上
,在那无尽的谎言之上
,他眼底的光芒，将罪人们灼伤
,也让他永远活在世上
,留下残损的心脏，和破碎的胸膛
,以及爱情的假死亡
,我看见天是蓝的云是白的我是哭的你是笑的
,梦着不如醒着
,我看见人群聚了人群散了歌声起了乐句终了
,爱了不如算了
,在我心上，留下的枪伤
,到阴天都还会痛呢
,用杜冷丁救场，药效却消亡

,直到化成灰烬
,请安静地听来自远方的声音
,正在上演死亡的游戏
,上天堂或下地狱
,且追随那上天的旨意

,有人说他活该
,有人说因为爱

,重复上演真爱已不再
,是魔鬼或天使
,且追随那上天的旨意
,
,想要靠近那火焰
,又不受伤
,那诱人的火焰
,别碰！
,No！
,No！

,唱着被爱情伤透的结局
,痛彻心扉的曾经
,谁能放得下爱情！爱情！爱情！

,你不说话 我不说话 两个哑巴
,漫不经心 望天打卦 千变万化
,让驯服 去死吧
,何必非要 眷恋呐
,管那言语 几分戏谑 几分真假
,让我 做个暗中取暖的浓烈火把
,让我 捕捉稍不经意溜走的烟霞
,别问我 “有没有” “没有”
,为我温酒的人家
,诋毁我吧 像酒鬼满嘴粗话
,赶走霉运 酿的苦果 就在刹那
,嘻嘻哈哈 养成模样 飞壁走崖
,自由身 乱表达
,当灵魂 没灯塔
,我还是我 我还是我 无根无家
,芴漠无形，变化无常。
,死与？生与？天地并与？神明往与？芒乎何之？忽乎何适？
,万物毕罗，莫足以归。
,古之道术有在于是者，庄周闻其风而悦之。
,以谬悠之说，荒唐之言，无端崖之辞，时恣纵而不傥，不以觭见之也。
,以天下为沉浊，不可与庄语。
,以卮言为曼衍，以重言为真，以寓言为广。
,独与天地精神往来，而不傲睨于万物。
,不谴是非，以与世俗处。
,让我 掠过深蓝海域后穷途末路
,让我 肆无忌惮把爱带进了坟墓
,别再说 “世间有” “没有”
,青山绿水般的向往
,嘲讽我吧 将愿望当成笑话
,没人说话 没人回答 都是哑巴

,I took for granted her gentleness

,My heart is falling in my breast
,And as I lie me down to rest
,There's a mountain of regret
,I turn my back on her true love

,My heart is falling in my breast
,And as I lie me down to rest
,There's a mountain of regret
,
,And as I sit here feeling low
,Wondering why she had to go
,I know I see through my disgrace
,The perfect beauty of her face

When it was dark
I was a question mark
Becoming the gunship
I had a heart
But it was torn apart
Now I'm the gunship
Run away cannonball
Bombs away
You don't wanna be here
When I hit 'em all
And like the wealth
That doesn't know itself
I am a bird that doesn't fly
I lost desire
To hold my fire
I am the gunship
Run away cannonball
Bombs away
You don't wanna be here
When I hit 'em all
When it was dark
I was question mark
Becoming the gunship
I couldn't stop
Had no control to turn it off
I was the gunship
I am the gunship
Will be the gunship
Becoming the gunship

,I'm in a wide open space,
,I'm standing
,
,I'm all alone and staring into space
,It's always quiet thru' my ceiling
,The roof comes in and crashes in a daze
,
,I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
,You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me
,I'm in a wide open space, I'm staring
,There's something quite bizarre I cannot see
,
,I'm on the top of a hill, I'm lonely
,There's someone here to shout to miles away
,I could be back in my house, for I care
,They do not hear me, it's the same old case
,
,I'm in a wide open space, it's freezing
,You'll never get to heaven with a smile on your face from me

,Why don't you come in?

,Every time I get no further
,How long has it been?
,Come on in now
,Wipe your feet on my dreams
,You take up my time
,Like some cheap magazine
,When I could have been
,Learning something
,Oh well, you know what I mean

,& every touch reminds you of just how sweet it could have been
,& every time he kisses you, you get the taste of saccharine.
,It's not easy to forget me, it's so hard to disconnect,
,when it's electronically reprocessed to give a more life-like effect.
,Aah, sing your song about all the sad imitations that got it so wrong:
,It's like a later ＂Tom & Jerry＂ when the two of them could talk,
,like the Stones since the Eighties, like the last days of Southfork.
,Like ＂Planet of the Apes＂ on TV., the second side of ＂'Til the Band Comes in＂,
,like an own-brand box of cornflakes: he's going to let you down my friend.

,The other night
,I had a dream
,There was a world full of kings and queens
,But it was cold
,Dark as the night
,We were the fire on the moonlit skies
,We weren't divided
,We were the same
,And we were free
,But we all wore chains
,We couldn't see it
,But we created
,A place between truth and overrated
,If I could just see it all
,Just like a fly on the wall
,Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
,And would I share what I saw?
,Or just sit back and ignore
,Like nothing never happened,
,I haven't seen you before?
,I'm on the run from a thief
,I let into my head
,I know,
,I hold the keys,
,so don't be scared
,When I turn and shout:
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take your words,
,and your lies and just beat it!
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take the hurt and the pain,
,I don't need it!
,I wanna live,
,I wanna be the change
,We can all be kings and queens
,If we can just learn to believe
,If we can just learn to believe
,We had a plan to build a wall
,A great divide that would never fall
,To separate us
,From all the pain
,And keep our skeletons locked away
,And brick by brick
,We built it so thick
,That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
,And one by one
,We all became numb
,We were making the bullets to a broken gun
,If I could just see it all
,Just like a fly on the wall
,Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
,And would I share what I saw?
,Or just sit back and ignore
,Like nothing never happened
,And I haven't seen you before?
,I'm on the run from a thief
,I let into my head
,I know,
,I hold the keys,
,so don't be scared
,When I turn and shout:
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take your words,
,and your lies and just beat it!
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take the hurt and the pain,
,I don't need it
,I wanna live,
,I wanna be the change
,We can all be kings and queens
,If we can just learn to believe
,If we can just learn to believe
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take your words,
,and your lies and just beat it!
,I don't think I need you anymore
,Take the hurt and the pain,
,I don't need it!
,I wanna live,
,I wanna be the change
,We can all be kings and queens
,If we can just learn to believe
,If we can just learn to believe
,I am a little bit of loneliness
,A little bit of disregard
,Handful of complaints
,But I help the fact
,That everybody can see these scars
,I am what I want you to want
,What I want you to feel
,But its like no matter what I do
,I can\'t convince you
,To just believe this is real
,So I let go of watching you
,Turn your back like you always do
,Face away and pretend that I\'m not
,But I\'ll be here cause your all that I\'ve got
,I can\'t feel the way I did before
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,Time won\'t tell
,There\'s damage anymore
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,I am a little bit insecure
,A little unconfident
,Cause you don\'t understand
,I do what I can
,But sometimes I don\'t make sense
,What you never want to say
,But I\'ve never had a doubt
,It\'s like no matter what I do
,I can\'t convince you
,For once just to hear me out
,So I let go of watching you
,Turn your back like you always do
,Face away and pretend that I\'m not
,But I\'ll be here cause your all that I\'ve got
,I can\'t feel the way I did before
,Don\'t turn your back on me

,Time won\'t heal
,There\'s damage anymore
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,Now!
,Hear me out now
,Your gonna listen to me like it or not
,Right now!
,Hear me out now

,那是一个寒冷的早上
,我背着吉他离开了家乡
,只有一件东西要去寻找 谁都不能阻挡
,那是原本就属于我的自由
,来到高楼林立的北京
,像是鸟儿从笼中飞出
,多年以后渐渐习惯它变成我的天空
,却有种感觉又回到笼中
,你说过有个云之南的地方
,四季花开
,还有彩虹的翅膀
,我要飞去云之南的地方
,在彩虹之巅
,还要为你歌唱
,歌唱自由！是与生俱来的自由！

,直到感觉你的发线
,有了白雪的痕迹
,直到视线变得模糊
,直到不能呼吸

,如果全世界我也可以放弃
,至少还有你值得我去珍惜
,而你在这里
,就是生命的奇迹
,也许全世界我也可以忘记
,只是不愿意失去你的消息
,你掌心的痣

,一梦醒来
,自己躺在
,花园的门外
,不容选择
,我的此刻
,注定和繁华放开
,身边空间如此狭窄
,我双翼展不开
,对着小小的天窗呼喊
,能有几颗星星明白
,我收拾好悲伤
,背起沉重行囊
,开始向未知远航
,我重来不伪装
,不想和他们一样
,安于现状只会将希望埋葬
,总有一片更大的天空
,等我去飞翔
,天地之间再多尘埃
,染不了我一身羽白
,锋利荆棘在脚下踩
,疼痛却教会我忍耐
,金子或石头我的未来
,不必猜我自己主宰
,这渴望是如此的澎湃
,就算最终面对失败
,也无法更改
,我心中的故乡
,不能守在你的身旁
,梦起飞的地方
,永不会被遗忘
,记住那欢笑泪水就勇敢去闯
,总有一片更大的天空
,等我去飞翔
,我收拾好悲伤
,背起沉重行囊

,我们都曾经寂寞而给对方承诺
,我们都因为折磨而厌倦了生活
,只是这样的日子
,同样的方式
,还要多久
,我们改变了态度而接纳了对方
,我们委屈了自己成全谁的梦想
,只是这样的日子
,还剩下多少
,已不重要
,时常想起过去的温存
,它让我在夜里不会冷
,你说一个人的美丽是认真
,两个人能在一起是缘份
,早知道是这样
,像梦一场
,我才不会把爱都放在同一个地方
,我能原谅
,你的荒唐
,荒唐的是我没有办法遗忘
,早知道是这样
,如梦一场
,我又何必把泪都锁在自己的眼眶
,让你去疯
,让你去狂
,让你在没有我的地方坚强
,让我在没有你的地方疗伤

The sun burnt out today
Tomorrow's just another day
So far away
When everything's so cold and grey
Awake in a daze
Time has seemed to change my face
Look away!
Look away!
I was ugly like you yesterday
Reinvent me
Don't panic
You're getting too close
It's contagious
It's turning you into everything that you've hated
Destroyed and created
The Infected
I'm making history
I swam across the seven seas
And I scraped my knees
From bowing down to royalty
So face to face
In the mirror stares my enemy
Cuz all I see
Instead of me
Is just another fucking casualty
Reinvent me
You'ore a fake
Disconnected
Lost your heart
Self-inflicted
Can I take you back to when it was real
When you cared about the way that 
I feel
,Dead By April - Promise Me
,Into the fire on my own.
,
,I know I won't see your face again, hey
,Are you sitting there alone, he-e-e-y!
,Are you thinking like me of the laughing times
,Or of the sad and loving times.
,Everything that's left from us is there where you are!
,Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful!
,Promise me to think of us still bright still colorful!
,Promise me to look back at us as a time in your life you enjoyed.
,
,Surrounded by flames everywhere
,What I used to be I'm not even there
,The absence of you is killing me, he-e-e-y!
,Are you thinking like me of the laughing times
,Or of the sad and loving times.
,Everything that's left from us is there where you are!

If I had to choose 
to either bleed or bruise 
i wouldn't hesitate 
cause i've been there


If you had a doubt
if I was in or out
I wouldn't hesitate
cause I've been there

All my life is speeding up 
I swear I'm never giving up on you--huuu


Under the lights 
it's just you and I
Knowing there's no one else to blame 
A shot in the dark
We're caught in a spark
knowing there's no one else to blame


It feels dangerous
to be the two of us
but i wouldn't hesitate
if you've been there

And I've been holding out
And you've been losing out
But you don't hesitate
If you've been there

All your life is speeding up
off control i don't know what i'll do--huuu

,it's not going away,

,You and I both, we come from different worlds
,
,I'm a small town kid and you're an uptown girl
,
,We've both been hurt, we got a few scars
,
,But it don't matter now, we're staring at the stars
,
,When it comes to my heart you gotta catch and fall
,
,Deep down in my soul I know that I would die
,
,If I didn't have you how could I ever fly?
,
,100 miles beyond the sky
,
,It's feeling like we're high above the ground
,
,It's feeling like we're never coming down
,Til we want to
,But why would we want to
,
,It's feeling like we're high above the ground
,It's feeling like we're never coming down
,Til we want to
,But why would we want to （now）?
,Remember that day, we knew it from the start
,
,We've come a long way and we're gonna go far
,
,I see the future in your eyes
,
,Forever and always, you and I

,
,You walked away without a sound
,Sold your flat and left the town
,No goodbye
,No reply
,And suddently every song's about you
,We should have made a better plan
,I should have been a better man
,And I would
,If I could
,But the truth is I'm choking on my halo
,Wish that I was so much stronger
,Thought I had a heart of steel
,I can't hold it back no longer, no
,Cause I miss the pillow talk
,And the moments that we caught
,Even though that all we has was nothing but a game
,I miss the pillow talk
,And the battles that we fought
,With every step I take on my eternal walk of shame
,I miss our pillow talk
,I'm weaving dreams on broken looms
,While dripping tears in your perfume
,Like a fool
,Out of love
,"You don't know what you got till it's gone"
,I see your face in every crowd
,Hear your voice so clear and loud
,And it hurts
,And it burns
,Can you hear it? Our song is on the radio
,I can't hold it back no longer, no
,Cause I miss the pillow talk
,And the moments that we caught
,Even though that all we had was nothing but a game
,I miss the pillow talk
,And the battles that we fought
,With every step I take on my eternal walk of shame
,I miss our pillow talk
,I miss our pillow talk
,Wish that I was so much stronger
,Thought I had a heart of steel
,I can't hold it back no longer, no

,在我的故乡 黄河上游
,有一种灌溉用的工具叫水车
,在黄河边经常会看到一个接着一个的很大的车轮
,但是今天我给你的水车
,可能和那个没有关系
,只是我很小的时候 坐在水车边上
,对这个世界的一些梦想
,但是今天这些梦想已经被车轮碾的支离破碎
,我捡到的只是一些碎片
,当故乡的河水
,再也不能打湿我匆忙的脚步
,谁在酒肉穿肠的街道
,询问我丢失的黄昏呢
,当异族的圣火
,在我们的身旁 忘情地燃烧啊
,又有多少村庄 多少家园
,在暴雨中 伴随着泪水
,随风而去 随风而去 随风而去

,理想总是飞来飞去
,虚无缥缈
,现实还是实实在在
,无法躲藏
,心里充满欲望
,身体没有力量
,不想感到悲伤
,只好装得放荡
,飞来飞去
,飞来飞去
,满怀希望
,我象一只小鸟
,我感觉不到倦意
,却又无处可去
,空虚把我仍在街上
,象个病人逃避着死亡
,这里适合游荡
,眼睛无法闭上
,楼群那么辉煌
,灯光那么明亮
,飞来飞去
,飞来飞去
,现实是个笼子
,我象一只小鸟
,他们给我一对翅膀
,
,他们给我一个方向
,他们说那就是幸福
,于是我满怀希望
,我朝那里甜蜜地飞翔
,然后看到了真相
,那里没有幸福
,只有一堵大墙
,飞来飞去
,飞来飞去
,满怀希望
,我象一只小鸟
,
,我再也不想麻木
,再也不想任人摆布
,再也不想在谎言中让生命虚度
,我们曾经流浪街头
,任寒风拍打着胸口
,我们曾经握紧拳头
,在争取着一点点自由
,让我们一起唱吧
,唱一首自由之歌
,让我们一起飞吧飞向天空
,让我们一起唱吧
,唱一首自由之歌
,让我们一起飞
,象一只小鸟
,象一只小鸟
,因为我们
,生来自由

曲：裂缝乐队
穿过了断壁残垣
令人窒息
恐惧在空气中蔓延
错误的选择
迷失自我
撕下冰冷的伪装
面对死亡
愤怒 咆哮
荣耀被黑暗吞噬
忏悔 祈祷
无法逃脱这权利的游戏
在黑暗中
掌握着命运的双手
扣动权力的扳机
死亡在瞬间到来
夺走残留的微笑
飞翔吧
穿过我炽热的胸膛
死亡在瞬间到来
夺走残留的微笑
飞翔吧
穿过我炽热的胸膛
愤怒 咆哮
荣耀被黑暗吞噬
忏悔 祈祷
无法逃脱这权利的游戏

,And no one cares about all those things
,The next day we wouldn’t even really slightly remember
,A night spent with a crocodile
,Will remain in my memories for a while
,And a naked picture of us

Story books I thought were written for my heart
From my fingers, fall
With you gone, I break, drifting off in space
Can you hear me call?
I need you, need you, I need you
I need you, need you, I need you
As all these mornings turn into brand new days
Everything still hurts, you're so far away
I would dig a hole through the Earth and crawl to get to you
To get to you...
Wicked dreams, they come when I sleep alone
So I stay awake
Thinking, oh, how I miss her so
How long must I wait?
I need you, need you, I need you
I need you, need you, I need you
As all these mornings turn into brand new days
Everything still hurts, your so far away
I would dig a hole through the Earth and crawl to get to you
To get to you...
As all these mornings turn into brand new days
Everything still hurts, your so far away

,For you, and your denial
,I’m watching you break down (break down)
,Hate me all you want, I'll be okay
,I'm half the world away
,I'm letting you go now (go now)
,You got sadness twisted up with jealousy
,Show your fists to make them look like loyalty
,And I have seen what holding on can take away
,If it's the past you love then that's where you can stay

, Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
, The shadow in the background of the morgue
, The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
, We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
, Where you can always find me
, We'll have Halloween on Christmas
, And in the night we'll wish this never ends
, We'll wish this never ends
, (I miss you I miss you)
, (I miss you I miss you)
, Where are you and I'm so sorry
, I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
, I need somebody and always
, This sick strange darkness
, Comes creeping on so haunting every time
, And as I stared I counted
, Webs from all the spiders
, Catching things and eating their insides
, Like indecision to call you
, and hear your voice of treason
, Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
, Stop this pain tonight
, Don't waste your time on me you're already
, The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
, Don't waste your time on me you're already
, The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
, Don't waste your time on me you're already

You'll never know what it feels like to go there
When love changes, faces appear from nowhere
Where beautiful, lovely is ugly or alone
You need me back bad, just can't be on your own
Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye
Now your life is broken, revolves around love
No love on yourself but the love you have lost
We said desperation is lonely despair
You don't love yourself, you've got no love to show
Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
Love's not a battle, it's a ticking time bomb
I'm gonna let you bleed for a little bit
I'm gonna make you beg just for making me cry
I'm gonna make you wish you never said goodbye
If your gonna take me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
If your gonna take me back you're gonna have to ask nicer than that
Now your life is broken, revolves around love
No love on yourself but the love you have lost
We said desperation is lonely despair
You don't love yourself, you've got no love to show

  So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 Then go
 But my heart's going with you
 
 For the less you say
 The more I want to hear
 The less you give
 The more that I receive
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for
 Waiting for the next time that you're near me
 
 And I don't know why I want you
 And I don't know why I need you
 But I know you have my love
 So sliently you thrill me
 So silently you win me
 It's the silent type for me
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for
 The next time you are here
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting 
 For the next time that you come around
 
 So if you get to thinking
 The same as I've been dreaming
 Then let me know
 Just let me know
 
 When you leave me
 And you have to go
 Then you gotta go
 But my heart's going with you

 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for you next time lover 
 Waiting for you next time

,When you fall asleep
,Before the end of the day
,You start to worry
,Like when the taxi comes
,To take you away
,When you're in no hurry
,Yet as our hair turns white
,All the stars still shine so bright above
,At least it's not the end of the world?
,Why...?
,We could live it large
,Coz we're only old once
,Let's make a difference
,Turn all the hate in the world
,Into a mocking bird
,Make it fly away
,Yet as our hair turns gray
,Everything is far from A. O.K.
,At least it's not the end of the world?
,No! No!
,At least it's not the end of the world?

,﻿Caught in the middle of a crossfire
,Lost my balance on a high wire
,Trying to figure out what to do
,Pushed to the edge of my reason
,Everywhere around me it's treason
,I don't want to do that to you
,Kamikaze airplanes in the sky
,Are we going down or will we fly?
,This could be a shipwreck on the shore
,Or we could sail away forevermore
,This time it's sink or swim, sink or swim
,Hearing the song in your laughter
,A melody I chase after
,No one else has done this to me
,Kamikaze airplanes in the sky
,Are we going down or will we fly?
,This could be a shipwreck on the shore
,Or we could sail away forevermore
,This time it's sink or swim
,Take a deep breath
,No more time left
,This is what I thought I wanted
,Why am I afraid?
,Kamikaze airplanes in the sky
,Are we going down or will we fly?

,sometimes I lay
,Under the moon
,And thank God I'm breathing
,Then I pray
,Don't take me soon
,Cause I am here for a reason
,Sometimes in my tears I drown
,But I never let it get me down
,So when negativity surrounds
,I know some day it'll all turn around
,Because
,All my life I've been waiting for
,I've been praying for
,For the people to say
,That we don't wanna fight no more
,There'll be no more wars
,And our children will play

,It's not about
,Win or lose cause
,We all lose
,When they feed on the souls of the innocent
,Blood drenched pavement
,Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
,In this maze you can lose your way
,It might drive you crazy but don't let it getting your way (no way)
,Sometimes in my tears I drown
,But I never let it get me down

,Treat people the same
,Stop with the violence
,Down with the hate
,One day we'll all be free
,And proud to be
,Under the same sun
,Singing songs of freedom like

,I could have been easier on you
,I could have been all you held onto
,I know I wasn't fair' I tried my best to care about you
,
,I know I could have been a better man
,But I always had to have the upper hand
,I'm struggling to see the better side of me
,But I can't take all your jabs and taunts
,You're pointing out my every fault
,And you wonder why I walked away
,
,When you tell me I'm a wreck
,You say that I'm a mess
,How could you expect anything less?
,
,You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along
,
,I told you when you asked
,I knew this wouldn't last
,At least I could be honest about that
,And now you're telling everyone
,How I only did you wrong
,
,I guess you never knew me at all
,
,Remember on my 21st birthday
,You took me where we went on our first date
,We stayed till closing time' after 4 glasses of wine
,You started with a pointless argument
,You said that I forgot to compliment
,The dress you wore that night
,That I've seen a thousand times
,But I think we just want different things
,I want space' you want a diamond ring
,Whatever made you think we were meant to be?

,From the get-go, I knew this was hard to hold

,And if I had to pull you out of the wreckage
,You know I'm never gonna let you go
,We're like a time bomb
,Gonna lose it, let's defuse it
,Baby, we're like a time bomb
,But I need it, wouldn't have it
,Any other way
,Well, there's no way out of this, so let's stay in
,Have a storm that comes that'll soak us to an end
,Oh, resistance is useless
,Just two kids, stupid and fearless
,Like a bullet shooting a lesson
,There's only one way down this road
,It was like a time bomb, set it in motion

,But I need it, wouldn't have it
,Any other way
,Got my heart in your hands
,Like a time bomb ticking
,It goes off, we start again
,If it breaks, we fix it
,Got your heart in my hands
,Like a time bomb ticking
,We should know better we won't let go
,It was like a time bomb, set it in motion
,We knew that we're destined to explode

,If you were good for me at all
,I wanna say, that everything’s fine
,But it’s not… but it’s not
,All the times you made me stay
,I see it all so clear today
,And I wish I could
,Turn back time… turn back time
,If I had a choice
,I’d leave all behind
,I’d make you leave my mind
,Leave my mind
,The things you had me do
,Everytime you knew I would
,I wanna say, that I was aware
,But I can’t… but I can’t
,All you tried to take away
,And I feel like a fool
,I let myself down… let myself down
,And you begged me to trust you
,I wish I never did

,あの日僕の心は 音もなく崩れ去った
,壊れて叫んでも 消し去れない記憶と暗闇が
,瞳の中へと流れ込む
,もう色さえ見えない 明日へと沈む
,
,
,分かり合える日を 止めどなく探した
,失うためだけに 今を生きてく
,もう駄目だと 一人孤独を抱いても
,If you turn on the lights
,光へ 照らしてく
,「願い続ける想い いつか色づくよ」と
,教えてくれた心に生き続ける人
,何もかも 必然の中で生まれるColors
,もう一度この手で 明日を描けるから
,
,いつの間にか僕は 失くすことにも慣れ
,手に入れた物さえ 指をすり抜けてく
,涙が枯れる前に 聞きたかった言葉は
,今は誰かを救うために（It's all your fate You gonna dothat）
,「光が強くなれば 闇も深くなる」と
,気づいたとしても 恐れることはないよ
,何もかも 心の果てに生まれるColors
,もう瞳を開いて 見つめられるから
,
,
,悲しみのBreath それは探してた色を滲ませるよ
,音も立てずに
,「願い続ける想い いつか色づくよ」と
,教えてくれた心に生き続ける人
,何もかも 必然の中で生まれるColors
,もう一度照らすよ 光の指先で
,Just drawing Colors in light and darkness
,And take it Colors in light and darkness
,今は届かない優しい色も
,全てはまたこの手で 描き直せるから

,I can't seem to face up to the facts
,I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax
,I can't sleep, 'cause my bed's on fire

,Livin' on a prayer
,Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
,Livin' on a prayer
,Tommy got his six string in hock
,Now he's holding in what he used
,To make it talk - so tough' it's tough
,Gina dreams of running away
,When she cries in the night
,Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay' someday
,We've got to hold on to what we've got
,'Cause it doesn't make a difference
,If we make it or not
,We've got each other and that's a lot
,For love - we'll give it a shot
,We're half way there
,Livin' on a prayer
,Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
,Livin' on a prayer

,Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
,Sometimes I feel like everybody’s got a problem.
,Sometimes I feel like nobody wants to solve them.
,I know that people say we’re never gonna make it.
,But I know we’re gonna get though this
,
,Close your eyes and please don’t let me go.
,Don't Don't Don't, Don’t let me go now.
,Close your eyes don’t let me let you go.
,Don't Don't Don't, Take my hand tonight
,Let’s not think about tomorrow.
,Take my hand tonight.
,We can find some place to go.
,Cause our hearts are locked forever.
,And our love will never die.
,Take my hand tonight one last time.
,
,Hey,Hey!!!
,
,Hey,Hey!!!
,
,The city Sleeps and we’re lost in the moment.
,
,Another kiss as we’re lying on the pavement.
,If they could see us they would tell us that we’re crazy.
,But I know they just don’t understand
,
,Close your eyes and please don’t let me go.
,Don't Don't Don't, Don’t let me go now.

,The rain drops, the tears keep falling.
,I see your face and it keeps me going
,If I get lost your light’s gonna guide me.
,And I know that you can take me home.
,You can take me home.
,
,Take my hand tonight
,Let’s not think about tomorrow.
,Take my hand tonight.

,
,Long as I remember the rain been comin' down.
,Clouds of myst'ry pourin' confusion on the ground.
,Good men through the ages, tryin' to find the sun;
,And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain.
,
,I went down virginia, seekin' shelter from the storm.
,Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow.
,Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains.
,And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.
,
,Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.
,The crowd had rushed together, tryin' to keep warm.
,Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears.
,And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.

,He had his fist up in the air
,And called me "brother"
,Said, "My friends are over there"
,They call themselves immortals
,They're the truest of the true
,And in that very moment
,I was born again like you

,Raise your fist up in the air
,Play metal louder than hell
,Louder than hell
,They can't stop us
,Let 'em try
,For heavy metal
,We would die
,Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
,Know my words are true
,There's a battle for true metal
,They're marching; they're marching on
,Me and you
,Ten thousand strong are here tonight
,With twenty thousand fists up in the air
,The power of true metal's calling you
,It's everywhere
,Hold your head up high

Lyrics：John Lennon Music：John Lennon
(This is a story about your friend and mine
Who is it, who is it, who is it?)
There you stand with your L.A. tan
And your New York walk and your New York talk
You're mother left you when you were small
But you're gonna wish you wasn't born at all
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Your phone don't ring no one answers your call
How does it feel to be off the wall
Well your mouthpiece squawks as he spreads your lies
But you can't pull strings if your hands are tied
Well your teeth are clean but your mind is capped
You leave your smell like an alley cat
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass
Steel and glass

,谁想 上班 都市又局限又太平淡
,直到夜晚 弥留工作间 在这规矩中每天往返
,和她 分开了 令这杯开水变得更淡
,在这空废人间 只好强行支撑 继续撑
,这里日复着日 夜复夜 烦恼照样复制
,几次别後又聚 聚又别 连贯如像路轨
,延误却没法拾遗 遗憾你却未留低
,如常抱憾 机会断送给别人
,燃烧都转降温 不过有烙印
,完全没 半件战利品
,绵里有针 曾爱过最终陌路人
,如果注定要分 总当过陪衬
,无言地 笑着喝下香槟 但抖震
,门阶 太高 找机会但是自信零度
,或会望到 谁人拖你手 我摺起变了你的弃稿
,宁愿 不知道 但痛苦总叫我想却步
,跌倒拭去尘土 不想对着风急 与浪高
,这里日复着日 夜复夜 烦恼照样复制
,几次别後又聚 聚又别 连贯如像路轨

,绵里有针 曾爱过最终陌路人
,如果注定要分 总当过陪衬
,无言地 笑着喝下香槟 像处分
,总会不断地问 原来不用乱问 答覆不太再重要
,解结需用利刃 原来都在附近 难题不值你一笑
,途人话放下了就会治疗 难道仍不弃历史那月票
,如常抱憾 一直在错捉用神
,燃烧都转降温 不过有烙印
,完全没 半件战利品
,绵里有针 曾爱过最终陌路人
,如果注定要分 总当过陪衬
,能强韧 笑着喝下香槟 就解困
,醇酒 一口烟 就已抵销哪里需控辩
,望天边渺云轻烟 已目染

,Smell the warm and salty air
,See a wave reflect a beam
,Stop and find a pretty shell for her
,Make it real your summer dream
,See another couple over there
,To them an ordinary day
,Soon you wonder where the time has gone
,The sun has almost slipped away
,Now it's gone and you'er alone
,In her eyes you see a gleam
,Time has come for you to show your love

,I heard a whisper on my radio
,But I paid no mind
,Just sat back and I let it go
,To catch the rain from a lonely waterfall
,But I might beware
,Cos they could drown me like a doll
,They got me running in and out of time
,I feel like a Bona Fide
,Keeper of the right and wrong
,And I've known all along, but let me just make it clear
,Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution
,But faith in any god is gonna bury us all
,No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
,Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all
,Carry us all
,I slip my skin as the prophets reappear
,But I pay no mind
,I'm just trying to persevere
,With the sins I have to shake from me within
,Though I might beware
,Cos they're just trying to wear me thin
,They got me running in and out of time

,Juanita and Juan
,Very clever with maracas
,Making their fortunes
,Selling secondhand tobaccoes
,Juan dances at Chico\'s
,And when the clients are evicted
,He empties the ashtrays
,And pockets all that he\'s collected
,But baby\'s on fire
,And all the instruments agree that
,Her temperature\'s rising
,But any idiot would know that

,The good old days are somewhere behind the clock
,Yet the wheels of time are never gonna stop
,The memory ain't crashin' down
,Look around baby
,Recall every piece of shit that ever made you proud
,Put your jeans n' leather on now or not
,Get everythin' locked n' loaded when you're still hot
,Turn every knob on you up to four o'clock
,It's the very moment to shout it out loud

,你说你猜不出我的想法
,那时我们是多么不愿回家
,通讯录上的名字渐渐陌生
,多年以后你想起我拨老电话
,忘记了吹灭生日蜡烛时的祈求
,相爱的人还没打招呼就溜走
,那痴心不改的少年我再没遇见
,灯红酒绿说笑着我们流泪的昨天
,时间原来就是这么简单
,轻易的改变我们的笑脸
,春去秋来飘落下的花瓣
,重复在我们的身边
,时间原来就是这么危险
,轻易的改变我们的诺言
,留下五颜六色爱情纪念
,在每个夜晚和我缠绵

,阳光洒在冷清的厂房
,机器不再转动 没有声响
,回想过去辉煌 只能更悲伤
,黎明前的村庄在远处闪着光
,风儿吹动 麦田的浪
,等待被宰的不开心的绵羊
,老人围坐在一起面容很慈祥
,那时夜晚很美 笑声爽朗
,几个青年相约 去一趟球场
,露天电影在放 苏联的经典
,或换上美丽的衣裙奔向大礼堂
,黎明前的村庄在远处闪着光
,风儿吹动 麦田的浪
,等待被宰的不开心的绵羊
,老人围坐在一起面容很慈祥
,小伙们都向往 寂寞的远方
,带我出去闯吧 像长了翅膀
,曾经发过誓言说等着我姑娘
,可再也没人真回来坐在她身旁
,每个人的理想在远处闪着光
,一幕一幕 欢乐荒唐
,我们还在路上拼命地追赶
,不知停在哪站是我们的天堂
,火车呼啸而过 把汽笛拉响
,装着温暖的梦 我们随处流浪
,这些只是春天的17个瞬间
,所有感动过的啊都渐渐被遗忘

穿梭在人群中 你微笑我冷漠
长啸于竹林间 为明天勾画无限
雾中的梦里游走昼夜无情
掩盖那些悲伤无言
躲藏着每一个黄昏的美
凝视着剑影中的谁
捕风捉影的矫健 已是我新的语言
曾经的花前月下 已成欺骗
今夜我为你狩猎 你们昨天的恩怨
我将用我的双手 了结

歌词大意：
你的野心需要收敛，因遥指天边而受耻辱
像水滴中的蚂蚁一样 永远都无法挣脱
你要有分寸把握，你要有自知之明
像被勒紧的野马一样 永远都无法驰骋 
副歌：
因我生在草原上，没谁能挡我视线。
因能度过半年冬，丝毫不惧怕失败。
译文：
放眼望去哟，草原上牛羊万千
身后却藏着我那长满獠牙的姐姐
哎呦，哎呦，不知道怎么办哟
哎呦，哎呦，真是伤脑筋哟
我的姐姐变成了十丈铜嘴兽哟
放眼望去哟，灌木杂草一片片
往下一瞅嘿，她正在啃木头哟
哎呦，哎呦，不知道怎么办哟
哎呦，哎呦，真是伤脑筋哟
我的姐姐变成了十丈铜嘴兽哟

No Use For A Name
More Betterness
Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me?
Maybe you don't understand it, what keeps them awake at night
What goes through their little minds when you turn off the light?
Always having to say sorry tears are stained on the pillow
Like the light of the moon they can't be one
Can't exist without the son
Let's think clearly for a while
Can he shine without a smile?
Why am I alone with no one to be found?
Looks like they know what's best for me
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand?
Guess I'll have to crawl inside and I don't know why
I'm sitting by myself, when the problem isn't mine
Been around the block a few times, been beat up by all his friends
Learing life is like a maze that never seems to end
Like an open book, blank pages left for only him to write
Life is short this chapter takes so long
Can't tell the right from the wrong
It's so hard for you to place
An expression on his face
Why am I alone with no one to be found?
Looks like they know what's best for me
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand?
Guess I'll have to crawl inside and I don't know why
I'm sitting by myself, when the problem isn't mine
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand
Why my friends and family left me
At six years old he won't be taught a meaning to this mess
He'll just have to take a guess, and make his own plan
And we'll never see the child that was forced to be a man

,She's dropping out of school 'cause she don't need the grade,
,The colors in her hair don't seem to fade,
,I get dressed up when I go out but she gets dressed down
,She's 17 I've told her I'm 20,
,I couldn't take her out 'cause Mom's got no money,
,It's stuff like this that makes me wish that I could change somehow
,Sitting here at home, it's obvious
,She's so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
,'Cause she makes me feel, makes me feel,
,Like I try, like I try, like I'm trying too hard,
,'Cause I'm not being me, and it's getting me down
,That she makes me think, makes me think,
,That I try, that I try, that I'm trying too hard again
,'Cause I'm trying too hard again
,She's got a rose tattoo but she keeps it covered,
,I play guitar but she's into drummers,
,She's seen my face around but she doesn't even know my name
,I pierced my lip so she thinks I'm cool,
,I ripped my jeans and dropped out of school,
,I followed her 'round the town but she thinks that I'm a weirdo now
,Sitting here at home, it's obvious
,She's so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
,'Cause she makes me feel, makes me feel,
,Like I try, like I try, like I'm trying too hard,
,'Cause I'm not being me, and it's getting me down
,That she makes me think, makes me think,
,That I try, that I try, that I'm trying too hard again
,But now, who knew?
,She's in the crowd of my show
,Nothing to lose,
,She's standing right in the front row
,The perfect view,
,She came alone on her own,
,And there's something that you should know
,You're so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
,'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
,Yeah she makes me feel, she makes me feel
,It's obvious
,She's so out of reach, and I'm finding it hard
,'Cause she makes me feel, makes me feel,
,Like I try, like I try, like I'm trying too hard,

,The storm is rushing on me
,Here's the flood flash
,I feel so locked and loaded
,Let me out, let me out
,Wake up in a wasteland
,Where the trees are crashing fast
,Make or break
,The road explodes
,Get out, get out of this town
,Live faster, live stronger
,Let us speed up
,Or get blown over
,
,Time's wasting
,How much longer
,Before I get myself free
,Of these hurricane streets?
,Headed for disaster
,Way beyond the fear
,
,In the rearview
,Watch it all just disappear
,Disappear
,I don't care where I'm headed
,Anywhere but here
,
,Won't waste my life
,Can't waste another night
,In this town, this town
,Live faster, live stronger
,Let us speed up
,Or get blown over
,Time's wasting
,How much longer
,Before I get myself free
,Of these hurricane...
,Leaves are blowing down the streets
,Wind crawling up our knees
,Somebody get the keys
,Rain is flowing from the sky
,But no fear in our eyes
,We're ready to fly
,Live faster, live stronger
,Let us speed up
,Or get blown over
,Time's wasting
,How much longer
,Before I get myself free
,Of these hurricane streets?
,Live faster, live stronger

,I am restless, and I keep trembling

,Waking up feeling naked
,In my clothes, inside a room that’s vacant
,Lost my nerve, it’s unnerving
,I know there is something I’m forgetting
,I searched the moon, I lost my head,
,I even looked under the bed
,I punched the walls, I hit the streets
,I’m pounding the pavement looking
,I’m missing you
,I’m missing you
,You’re not around and I’m a complete disaster
,I’m missing you
,Remember, was our first time
,I told you I loved you at the bus station
,Don’t forget, cause it’s not over
,I’m not lost cuz I’m just missing you
,I searched the moon, I lost my head,
,I even looked under the bed
,I punched the walls, I hit the streets
,I’m pounding the pavement looking
,I’m missing you
,I’m missing you
,You’re not around and I’m a complete disaster
,I’m missing you
,Say hey!
,Well she’s my bud
,And she’s my soul
,I get so lost
,Out in the cold
,Feels so far
,Like this lone star
,It gets so hard
,When I’m missing you
,I’m missing you
,I’m missing you
,You’re not around and I’m a fucking disaster
,I’m missing you
You think 
I've gone to far this time? 
Tossed to the wolves, for another feeding frenzy 
If you could see what's going on inside 
You'd probably second guess me my dark secret 
So tell me what is this all about? 
What is this call to arms? 
To test me? 
Take what you need from me 
Discard the rest, but 
I wont go peacefully 
I'm on the edge again 
Of breaking down in a world gone crazy 
I'm on the edge again 
And it's a mystery how it does not phase me 
So tell me how did you think 
I would react? 
I'm a pawn in this game and it's far from over 
This contradiction in terms makes it worse 
Been pushed to the edge kicked down knocked over 
Well here we stand again, and again, and again 
How's it end? is this the best of it? 
You've made it clear my friend 
That this is the end when all ties are broken 
Now taking a step back 
It's not alright 
What's been left behind 
Now looking down a new avenue 
Hoping to see the signs 
Now taking a step back 
What's not alright? 
Taking it one step at a time

 i don't need to be a global citizen
 because i'm blessed by nationality
 i'm member of a growing populace
 we enforce our popularity
 there are things that
 seem to pull us under
 and there are things
 that drag us down
 but there's a power
 and a vital presence
 thats lurking all around
 we've got the american Jesus
 see him on the interstate
 we've got the american Jesus
 he helped build the
 president's estate
 i feel sorry
 for the earth's population
 'cuz so few
 live in the U.S.A.
 at least the foreigners
 can copy our morality
 they can visit but they cannot stay
 only precious few
 can garner the prosperity
 it makes us walk
 with renewed confidence
 we've got a place to go when we die
 and the architect resides right here
 we've got the american Jesus
 overwhelming millions every day
 (exercising his authority)
 he's the farmers barren fields
 the force the army wields
 the expession in the faces
 of the starving children
 the power of the man
 he's the fuel that drives the clan
 he's the motive and conscience
 of the murderer
 he's the preacher on t.v.
 the false sincerity
 the form letter that's written
 by the big computers
 he's the nuclear bombs
 and the kids with no moms
 and i'm fearful that
 he's inside me

,Should I stay or should I go?
,It's always tease tease tease
,You′re happy when I′m on my knees
,One day is fine, next is black
,So if you want me off your back
,Well come on and let me know
,Should I Stay or should I go?
,Should I stay or should I go now?

,Some days I spend all day on the phone
,And other days I would just rather be alone
,Some days I feel like the whole world is waiting on an answer
,I've been caught under the radar so help me please
,It's been that kind of day so just go away
,And let the machine say what I want it to say
,It's never enough' it keeps getting tough
,I wanna listen to your voice but it keeps breaking up
,
,Some days I just don't wanna leave my home
,And other days I'm alive like a rolling stone
,Sometimes I feel so insignificant like it doesn't really even matter
,And I know that we all make mistakes
,
,'Cause I'm guilty as charged with a case of foot in mouth disease
,So help me see clearly as I try to just get myself
,to a place where my lens can adjust

,I've no consideration' zero mutual respect
,For billions who suffer from rational thought neglect
,I don't wanna waste a sentence' I don't want a convert-sation
,That's gonna end in disdain' disbelief and aggravation
,And I find it's getting harder to hang out
,With grown adults who actually believe
,In Santa Claus and Noah's Ark and that their god is the best
,My distaste has turned into detest
,Who would read a 2000 year old medical journal
,Techniques for bloodletting' advice on Trichinosis
,Would you navigate the globe with a map of a flat earth
,Without DNA testing' would you believe virgin birth
,I find it's getting painful to put up
,With grown adults who actually believe
,In Unicorns and Creation' and god always takes their side
,That's when my innocent jabbing turns snide
,Thank god for the grammy' thank god for the touchdown
,Thank god for blowing up the enemy's sacred ground
,So how am I supposed to take anything you say seriously'
,When you've free swapped will for faith' how and pre-destiny
,And it's getting agonizing to hang out
,With grown adults who actually believe
,Mythology and history trump physics and science
,My aversion has turned to abhorrence

,Talk over coffee for an hour or two,
,She wonders why I’m always in a good mood
,
,Killing time before she struts her stuff,
,She needs support and I’ve become the crutch
,She’ll never know how much she means to me,
,I’d play the game but I’m the referee

,Surrender… every word, every thought, every sound
,Surrender… every touch, every smile, every frown
,Surrender… all the pain we’ve endured until now
,Surrender… all the hope that I lost, you have found
,Surrender… yourself to me
,
,Even though I know what I’m looking for,
,She’s got a brick wall behind her door
,I’d travel time and confess to her,
,But I’m afraid she’d shoot the messenger

, 作曲 : McIlrath, Rise Against
,Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake
,And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
,It's a burden you've been buried
,In spite of all your prayers
,There's a light turned off inside your heart
,And you don't remember what it's like to care
,Knees are weak hands are shaking I can't breathe
,So give me the drug
,Keep me alive
,Give me what's left of my life
,But let me go
,Pull this plug
,Let me breathe
,On my own I'm finally free
,Don't let me go
,The trail of crumbs you left
,somehow got lost along the way
,If you never meant to leave
,Then you only had to stay
,But the memories that haunt us
,Are cherished just the same
,As the ones that bring us closer to the sky
,No matter how grave yet I fall through these clouds reaching are screaming
,So give me the drug
,Keep me alive
,Give me what's left of my life
,But let me go
,Pull this plug
,Let me breathe
,On my own I'm finally free
,Don't let me go
,This grip loosens but it never breaks （never breaks）
,We carry nothing but again you will forsake
,You words are always there to break my fall （break my fall）
,In them I find the comfort
,to see through it all
,（Guide me through un-chartered waters
,Before we lose our way again
,Will you be my compass
,Until forever until forever ends ）
,Knees are weak hands are shaking I can't breathe
,So give me the drug

,Tell me what should I do
,Tell me what should I say
,Is there even time for change

,And now, the end is near
,And so I face the final curtain
,You cunt, I'm not a queer
,I'll state my case of which I'm certain
,I've lived a life that's full
,And each and every highway
,And yet, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Regrets, I've had a few
,But then again too few to mention
,But dig, what I have to do
,I'll see it through with no devotion
,Of that, take care and just
,Be careful along the highway
,And more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,There were times
,I'm sure you knew
,When there was But fucking else to do
,but through it all When there was doubt
,I shot it up or kicked it out
,I faced the wall, and the wall
,And did it my way
,Knocked out in bed last night
,I've had my fill, my share of looting
,And now, the tears subside
,I find it all so amusing
,To think, I killed a cat
,And may I say, oh no, did not their way
,But no, oh no, not me
,And I did it my way
,For what is a brat ,What has he got
,When he finds out that he cannot
,Say the things, he truly thinks
,But only the words,Not what he feels
,The record shows,For I've got no clothes
,And did it my way
,I said I'd moved on and I'll leave it alone,
,But before I walk out there is something that I need you to know,
,I got lost in a blink of an eye,
,And I can never get back, no I've never got back,
,You were not there when I wanted to say,
,That you were everything that right
,and it wasn't you but me to change,
,Now I got to go it alone,
,But I'll never give up, no I'll never give up
,What am I fighting for,
,There must me something more,
,For all these words I sing,
,Do you feel anything
,I said I'm ok but I know how to lie,
,You were all that i had,
,You were delicate and hard to find,
,I got lost in the back of my mind,
,And I can never get back, no I've never got back
,You were not there when I needed to say,
,I hit the bottom so fast that my head was spinning 'round for days,
,Now I gotta go it alone,
,But I will never give up, no I'll never give up

,Blink 182 - I Miss You
,
,Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
,The shadow in the background of the morgue
,The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
,We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
,Where you can always find me
,We'll have Halloween on Christmas
,And in the night we'll wish this never ends
,We'll wish this never ends
,
,(I miss you I miss you)
,
,(I miss you I miss you)
,
,Where are you and I'm so sorry
,I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
,I need somebody and always
,This sick strange darkness
,Comes creeping on so haunting every time
,And as I stared I counted
,Webs from all the spiders
,Catching things and eating their insides
,Like indecision to call you
,and hear your voice of treason
,Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
,Stop this pain tonight
,Don't waste your time on me you're already
,The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
,Don't waste your time on me you're already
,The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)
,
,Don't waste your time on me you're already
,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
,Don't waste your time on me you're already
,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
,Don't waste your time on me you're already
,The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

,Once upon a time
,Somewhere far away from here
,I was drowning in a deep sleep
,Got no ground beneath my feet
,And there's so many faces
,I'm New York and I'm Japan
,There's so many things that I wanna know
,But I'll never understand...
,Now I'm dreaming in red
,Just drifting away
,I'm dreaming in red
,Come and take me away
,I just got to get it right
,Before I make it wrong
,Cause I'm breaking out and rising up
,While the world is falling down...
,
,Now I'm dreaming in red
,Just drifting away
,I'm dreaming in red
,Come and take me away
,Just take me away
,
,I'm dreaming in red
,
,I see the sun behind the night, sky
,One last moment before I say goodbye...

,Remember when America
,Had a middle class and an upper class
,That was way before the exodus
,That was the America that we thought was number one
,Thought would overcome, thought would never die
,That was just our pride and faith
,Two shitty deadly sins
,I know faith isn't one of 'em, but it should have been
,Cause some things are crumbling
,We have no camaraderie, Just a faith
,Someone would save us form despondence
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America, woooooah
,Number one America
,Was the slogan used
,To keep moral up when we knew we were already cooked
,Then the richer western states succeeded in secession
,And the eastern ones followed right behind
,
,Mexi-Can-America was the perfect name
,That epitomized the order significance, authority
,And affluence, we had turned it all around
,Went from number one straight to number two （shit）
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America, woooooah
,National Bankruptcy
,Circumcised Society
,USA dined and ditched
,FOX Reports poor is the new rich
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America, woooooah
,We called it America,
,Warm yourself by the fire, son,
,And the morning will come soon.
,I'll tell you stories of a better time,
,In a place that we once knew.
,Before we packed our bags
,And left all this behind us in the dust,
,We had a place that we could call home,
,And a life no one could touch.
,Don't hold me up now,
,I can stand my own ground,

,
,We are the angry and the desperate,
,The hungry, and the cold,
,We are the ones that kept quiet,
,And always did what we were told.
,But we've been sweating while you slept so calm,
,In the safety of your home.
,We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
,Everything you've known.
,Don't hold me up now,
,I can stand my own ground,
,I don't need your help now,
,You will let me down, down, down!
,Don't hold me up now,

,I don't need your help now,
,You will let me down, down, down!
,So open your eyes child,
,Let's be on our way.
,Broken windows and ashes
,Are guiding the way.
,Keep quiet no longer,
,We'll sing through the day,
,Of the lives that we've lost,
,And the lives we've reclaimed.

,When I was a young boy,
,My father took me into the city
,To see a marching band.

,He said, "Son when you grow up,
,would you be the savior of the broken,

,
,He said "Will you defeat them,
,your demons, and all the non-believers,
,the plans that they have made?"

,To join The Black Parade."

,And through it all, the rise and fall,
,the bodies in the streets.

,Your misery and hate will kill us all.
,So paint it black and take it back
,Let's shout it loud and clear
,Defiant to the end we hear the call
,
,To carry on

,Your memory will carry on
,We'll carry on

,On and on we carry through the fears
,Ooh oh ohhhh
,Disappointed faces of your peers
,Ooh oh ohhhh
,Take a look at me
,cause I could not care at all
,Do or die, you'll never make me

,Because the world will never take my heart
,Go and try, you'll never break me
,We want it all, we wanna play this part
,I won't explain or say I'm sorry
,I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
,Give a cheer for all the broken
,Listen here, because it's who we are
,I'm just a man, I'm not a hero

,So many things that I wanna say
,It's been a while since I've felt this way
,Everything's ok, nothing feels broken
,
,First day in a brand-new town
,What will it be like, will it all go down?
,Everyday I'm gonna write this down
,Right here in my diary
,
,And all this time, while the world passes us by
,What will we leave behind, but the pages of our lives?
,And if we take our time, I bet we can all find
,The things in life worth living for
,
,One thing I know is that when life's moving slow
,I'm not out here on my own, I've got You (to get me through this)
,I'm on a long journey through mountains of apathy
,And I'm not afraid to walk through
,
,Everywhere I look it's all so different
,Another city but it makes no difference
,Still going through the same old issues
,Everything's ok, nothing feels broken
,
,With the days of the old behind me
,Another summer and I feel like climbing
,Write another page while the sun's still shining

,Where in the world’s the forgotten?
,They’re lost inside your memory
,You’re dragging on, your heart’s been broken
,As we all go down in history
,Where in the world did the time go?
,It’s where your spirit seems to roam
,Like losing faith to our abandon
,Or an empty hallway from a broken home
,Well don’t look away from the arms of a bad dream
,Don’t look away, sometimes you’re better lost than to be seen
,I don’t feel strange, it’s more like haunted
,Another moment trapped in time
,I can’t quite put my finger on it
,But it’s like a child that was left behind
,So where in the world’s the forgotten?
,Like soldiers from a long lost war
,We share the scars from our abandon
,And what we remember becomes folklore
,Well, don’t look away from the arms of a bad dream
,Don’t look away, sometimes you’re better lost than to be seen
,Don’t look away from the arms of a moment
,Don’t look away from the arms of tomorrow
,Don’away t look from the arms of a moment
,Don’t look away from the arms of love
,Don't look away

,Last year flew by; goodbye to the good vibes
,What we thought were the best times
,Nights out with the people I love
,Now I’m lost in the neighborhood
,That raised me, praised me, made me who I am
,But my father was twice the man
,And now that pain’s resurfacing
,Brooklyn don’t feel the same
,Maybe I’m the one who’s changed or the one to blame
,Another drink down the drain
,Ten more before I get on that plane
,I swear I knew just what to say
,It’s all there on the tip of my tongue

,Upside down, but it was a good life
,I fell hard for the wine in France
,I didn’t call you back cause I was learning to dance
,And just who I’d become
,It’s all there on the tip of my tongue

,
,You get bumped and bruised and worse
,For choosing the road less traveled
,You know the reward is rich
,If you persist through the darkest battles
,Open your eyes,
,Your prize is right before you, somehow
,Whatever you do, just don't miss now
,
,You're on a bus
,Don't notice the miles and months fly by
,To the rest of us
,You're living the highest kind of life
,
,And though the price you pay
,Is costlier than it seems
,It's worth another day
,The end justifies your means
,
,All that you're working for
,Could blind you to the treasures all around you
,So don't miss these moments, please
,The joy before the crown you seek

,Through the window

,Laughing or crying
,If we have the whole world or have nothing
,I know there are long nights
,But we'll make it
,With every sunrise comes a new light
,And all of the things
,That make us feel like we have it all
,All of the times
,That make us realize

,Life is beautiful
,Life is beautiful
,A father's love
,A wedding dance
,New Year's dreams
,A toast with friends
,A soldier coming home from war
,The faith the hope of so much more
,A brand new life, a mother's prayer
,Shooting stars, ocean air
,A lover's kiss, and hard goodbyes
,Fireworks, Christmas lights
,These are things that make us feel alive
,These are the times that make us realize

,And they told me on the front lawn, I’m sorry I couldn’t go
,But I still know the song and the words and her name and the reasons

Into the Valley
Betrothed and divine
Realisations no virtue
But who can define
Why soldiers go marching
Those masses a line
This disease is catching
From victory to stone
Ahoy! Ahoy! Land, sea and sky
Ahoy! Ahoy! Boy, man and soldier
Ahoy! Ahoy! Deceived and then punctured
Ahoy! Ahoy! Long may they die
Out of concealment
Blank and stark eyed
Why so uncertain
This culture deceives
Prophesised, brainwashed
Tomorrow's demise
All systems failing
The placards unroll
Ahoy! Ahoy! Land, sea and sky
Ahoy! Ahoy! Boy, man and soldier
Ahoy! Ahoy! Deceived and then punctured
Ahoy! Ahoy! Long may they die
Time for the audit
The gathering trial
A collectors dilemma
Repositioned and filed 

,
,Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
,Your perfect love is casting out fear
,And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life
,I won't turn back, I know you are near
,And I will fear no evil
,For my God is with me
,And if my God is with me
,Whom then shall I fear?
,Whom then shall I fear?
,Oh no, You never let go
,Through the calm and through the storm
,Oh no, You never let go
,In every high and every low
,Oh no, You never let go
,Lord, You never let go of me
,
,And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
,A glorious light beyond all compare
,And there will be an end to these troubles
,But until that day comes
,We'll live to know You here on the earth
,And I will fear no evil
,For my God is with me
,And if my God is with me
,Whom then shall I fear?
,Whom then shall I fear?
,Oh no, You never let go
,Through the calm and through the storm
,Oh no, You never let go
,In every high and every low
,Oh no, You never let go
,Lord, You never let go of me
,
,I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
,And there will be an end to these troubles
,But until that day comes
,Still I will praise You, still I will praise You
,Oh no, You never let go
,Through the calm and through the storm
,Oh no, You never let go
,In every high and every low
,Oh no, You never let go
,You never let go of me
,Oh no, You never let go
,Through the calm and through the storm
,Oh no, You never let go
,In every high and every low
,Oh no, You never let go
,Lord, You never let go
,Through the calm and through the storm
,Oh no, You never let go
,In every high and every low
,Oh no, You never let go
,You never let go of me
,And I wish I could sleep
,But I'm tired, down, dirty in these borrowed sheets
,It's been a week
,And I've been singing to my feet, yeah
,But I won't admit defeat til
,Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
,（When you come by）
,For your information
,I love my demons
,Cause they keep me company, yeah
,I've grown to love my new routine
,But on my better days, better days, better days
,
,Consider yourself one of my best friends
,Consider yourself one of my enemies
,Oh enemies
,
,And I wish I could speak
,We spend the last half hour in the back room
,Celebrating me
,And now I feel a little cheap, yeah
,But I won't admit defeat til
,Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
,And it's not one of my better days, better days, better days
,Consider yourself one of my best friends
,Consider yourself one of my enemies
,
,Oh enemies
,
,Show a little skin and make a million
,For a little soul and make a million more
,
,A million more
,
,When I grow up, woah
,I wanna be famous, woah
,And when you grow up, woah
,Will you still blame us
,And I wish I could see that
,But I'm tired, down, dirty in these borrowed sheets
,It's been a bitch of a week, yeah
,Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
,Consider yourself one of my best friends
,Consider yourself one of my enemies
,Oh enemies
,Show a little skin and make a million
,For a little soul and make a million more
,Show a little skin and make a million
,For a little soul and make a million more
,If you're listening.
,Sing it back.
,String from your tether unwinds.
,Up and outward （but only） to bind.
,I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me.
,Are you listening?
,Sing it back.
,So tell me what do I need when the words lose their meaning.
,I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me.
,Yeah, stumble until you crawl.
,Sinking into sweet uncertainty.
,If you're listening.
,Are you listening?
,Sing it back.
,I'm still running away.
,I won't play your hide and seek game.
,I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me.
,What a dizzy dance.
,This sweetness will not be concerned with me.
,No the sweetness will not be concerned with.
,Another turning point
,a fork stuck in the road.
,Time grabs you by the wrist
,directs you where to go.
,So make the best of this test
,and don't ask why.
,It's not a question
,but a lesson learned in time.
,It's something unpredicatable
,but in the end it's right.
,I hope you had the time of your life.
,So take the photographs
,and still frames in your mind.
,Hang it on a shelf
,of good health and good time.
,Tattoos of memories
,and dead skin on trial.
,For what it's worth,
,it was worth all the while.
,It's something unpredicatable
,but in the end it's right.
,I hope you had the time of your life.
,It's something unpredicatable
,but in the end it's right.
,I hope you had the time of your life.
,It's something unpredicatable
,but in the end it's right.
,I hope you had the time of your life.

Standing there alone, 
the ship is waiting. 
All systems are go. 
"Are you sure?" 
Control is not convinced, 
but the computer 
has the evidence. 
No need to abort. 
The countdown starts. 
Watching in a trance, 
the crew is certain. 
Nothing left to chance, 
all is working. 
Trying to relax 
up in the capsule 
"Send me up a drink." 
jokes Major Tom. 
The count goes on... 
Earth below us 
drifting, falling. 
Floating weightless 
calling, calling home... 
Second stage is cut. 
We're now in orbit. 
Stabilizers up, 
runnning perfect. 
Starting to collect 
requested data. 
"What will it affect 
when all is done?" 
thinks Major Tom. 
Back at ground control, 
there is a problem. 
"Go to rockets full." 
Not responding. 
"Hello Major Tom. 
Are you receiving? 
Turn the thrusters on. 
We're standing by." 
There's no reply. 
Earth below us 
drifting, falling. 
Floating weightless 
calling, calling home... 
Across the stratosphere, 
a final message: 
"Give my wife my love." 
Then nothing more. 
Far beneath the ship, 
the world is mourning. 
They don't realize 
he's alive. 
No one understands, 
but Major Tom sees. 
"Now the light commands 
this is my home, 
I'm coming home." 
Earth below us 
drifting, falling. 
Floating weightless 
coming home... 
Earth below us 
drifting, falling. 
Floating weightless 
coming, coming 
home.
home.

And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay
Easy livin' and we're givin'
What we know we're dreamin' of
We are one havin' fun
Walkin' in the glow of love
Walking, ooh, whoa, ho oh whoa
Smilin' faces, goin' places
It's a wonder, it's so clear
By a fountain, climbin' mountains
As we'll hold each other near
Sippin' wine, we try to find
That special magic from above
As we share our affair
Talkin' in the glow of love
Oh, oh, ooh
In the glow of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Here in glow of love)
You're a shinin' star
(Here in glow of love)
No matter who you are
(Here in glow of love)
So I want to let you know you move me, yeah, yeah
(There is no better way to be)
Hold me, caress me
(I'm yours forever and a day)
We are a sweet bouquet, hey, hey
(Seasons for happiness are here)
Can you feel it all around you?
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture it in the glow of love)

,As we all go down in history
,Where in the world did the time go?
,It’s where your spirit seems to roam
,Like losing faith to our abandon
,Or an empty hallway from a broken home
,Well don’t look away from the arms of a bad dream

,You found a home
,In all your scars and ammunition
,You made your bed in salad days
,Amongst the ruin
,Ashes to ashes of our youth
,She smashed her knuckles into winter
,As autumn wind fades into black

,At the center of the Earth
,In the parking lot

,It didn't say much
,But it only confirmed that
,The center of the earth
,Is the end of the world
,And I could really careless

I don't want a lot I want just enough
So why has it got to be so damn tough
Livin' on the uptown side of jive
Hustlin' a buck to stay alive
Lookin' for a ten and they give your five
Well it's tough
You talk to the boss the boss is gruff
You ask for a raise and they call your bluff
You may get some but it's never enough
Because it's tough
Strong, like a magnum force
Rough, like a new divorce
Mean, like a three-time loser
Bad, like an L.A. cruiser
Down, like a limousine
Blind, like a submarine
Hard, like cold concrete
Tough, that's the rhythm of the beat
You hit the street and you look for work
You don't want to be some welfare jerk
But I wonder how you get to be Captain Kirk
It's tough
Now Kirk has a ship called the Enterprise
He cuts the aliens down to size
But I wonder what he'd do with the uptown guys
They're tough
Tough, try to get some cash
When you're looking for a raise and they give you trash
Rough, when you got it like that
And your woman's running 'round with a baseball bat
Hard, try to play it cool
When the girl's all know you're an out of work fool
Tough, how it seems to be
Wish I had somebody lookin' out for me
Try to find a lover if you dare
Even if you do she just won't care
Well no one ever said that that life is fair
Because it's tough
Saw a fine young lady the other day
I started my rap, I had a lot to say
But she said she was goin' with a C.P.A.
Now it's tough
Strong, like a superhero
Rough, like a bank book zero
Mean, like the Oakland Raiders
Bad, like the Caped Crusaders
Down, like a home run ball
Blind, like an umpire's call
Hard, like a cruel deceit
Tough, that's the rhythm of the beat
You worked all year to buy a brand new car
A Coupe de Ville or a Jaguar
But you didn't make enough for a good cigar
Because it's tough
So you went to the bank to try to get a loan
But the guy behind the desk had a heart as stone
He said, "You don't need a car, use the telephone"
It's tough
Tough, it's a way of life, lost your job
Your money, but not your wife
Rough, gettin' in the black, Uncle Sam's in your pocket
And your woman's on your back
Hard, that's the deal
Had to get a loan just to buy a meal
Tough, that's how it goes
When it's gettin' better, nobody knows
Strong, like Chocolate Thunder
Rough, like Stevie Wonder
Mean, like Brucie The Shark
Bad, like the Raider's Ark
Down, like Sugar's Glove
Blind, like a man in love
Hard, like a big defeat
Tough, that's the rhythm of the beat
Tough, that's the word
Unemployment is all I heard
Rough, when you start your day
Watch the finance man tow your car away
Hard, to hold a job
When you've been replaced by a little blue knob
Tough, like a dollar steak
Ain't someone ever gonna give me a break

Step back!
I'm the Queen of the night
Everybody gets down on me
It feels so good to be a bad girls.
Here comes my prince. He is so hot!
Your skin, your lips, your body
I am so crazy about you
*1 My gosh you seduce me
Baby, hold on to my precious body
Darlin' please satisfy my filthy desire
*2 Burn my eyes, Burn my blood
Burn it. everything you want
Break my heart. break my love
Baby stab me with your knife
Kiss me, feel me
Oh I don't want you to stop
Watch me, taste me
I'm addicted to you
More deeper, more harder
Your heart is pounding on me
It feels so good to be a girl
Tell me is this a dream
Don't wake me up forever
Take away pain with your gentle kiss
*1, *2 repeat
*2 repeat

You stutter at the thought of being taken back,
to all the times we would grow to know
We never should have let this go
We used to lay and watch the sun go down, beneath this town
You send the shivers to my core,
I was beggin' for your love and more
Thinking back to when everything fell away
I found a little piece of comfort in a song and we would sing
If I could start from the beginning,
create the oceans and the cities
Light the sky with a million lights,
illuminate the darkest nights
If I could start from the beginning
You told me that everything would be okay
When we'd stay up late and conversate
On all our love we had at stake
And now I lay and watch the sun but it's not much fun
Cause I've never been alone before,
not beggin' for your love no more
Thinking back to when everything fell away
I found a little piece of comfort in a song
If I could start from the beginning,
create the oceans and the cities
Light the sky with a million lights,
illuminate the darkest nights
If I could start from the beginning
The moon would rise and the sun would fall
All to the beat of our favorite songs
We'll be the king and queen of this never ending dream
If we could start from the beginning
So do I let go of everything that I know
Reoccurring dreams, it's so routine, just stay here with me
These lonely summer days and the time we spent away
If we could start from the beginning
If I could start from the beginning,
create the oceans and the cities
Light the sky with a million lights,
illuminate the darkest nights
If I could start from the beginning
If I could start from the beginning,
create the oceans and the cities
Light the sky with a million lights,
illuminate the darkest nights
If I could start from the beginning

Wake every heart and every tongue
To sing the new eternal song
And crown 
Him King of 
Glory nowConfess 
Him, Lord of all
You are the highest
You are the greatest
You are the 
Lord of all
Angels will worship
Nations will bow down
To the Lord of all
A day will come when all will sing
And glorify our matchless 
KingYour name unrivalled stands alone
You are the 
Lord of all
Let every heart
Let every tongue
Sing of Your name
Sing of Your name
Let every heart
Let every tongue
Sing, sing, sing
Lifting You higher, higher and higher
We decided today
To walk away from love
Scarlett and gray
Watching as the walls return to dust
We gonna sell the outcome
We will always have us in a photograph album
And I don't care about the baggage or the bad times
This is a new beginning, we'll get it right this time
And we're (something) burning slow
and she said take all the memories we're never going home
All that we need was a reason to get.....a summer ending to a winter night
We decided to stay (we decided to stay)
Even though the road was rough
Bruises they fade (bruises they fade)
Troubles 'cause we not....this tough
We gonna sell the outcome
We will always have us in a photograph album
And I don't care about the baggage or the bad times
This is a new beginning, we'll get it right this time
And we're (something) burning slow
and she said take all the memories we're never going home
All that we needed was a reason to get.....a summer ending to a winter night
And we're (something) burning slow
and she said take all the memories we're never going home
All that we needed was a reason to get.....a summer ending to a winter night
We're going uphill from here from now on
We're going uphill from here from now on
We're going uphill from here from now on
And we're (something) burning slow
and she said take all the memories we're never going home
All that we needed was a reason to get.....a summer ending to a winter night
And we're (something) burning slow
and she said take all the memories we're never going home
All that we needed was a reason to get.....a summer ending to a winter night

,The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to
,And the pool hall I loved as a kid
,Is now a Seven Eleven ohohoh
,I went downtown to look for a job
,I had no training, no experience to speak of
,I looked at the holes in my jeans
,And turned and headed back ohohoh

 i don't need to be a global citizen
 because i'm blessed by nationality
 i'm member of a growing populace
 we enforce our popularity
 there are things that
 seem to pull us under
 and there are things
 that drag us down
 but there's a power
 and a vital presence
 thats lurking all around
 we've got the american Jesus
 see him on the interstate
 we've got the american Jesus
 he helped build the
 president's estate
 i feel sorry
 for the earth's population
 'cuz so few
 live in the U.S.A.
 at least the foreigners
 can copy our morality
 they can visit but they cannot stay
 only precious few
 can garner the prosperity
 it makes us walk
 with renewed confidence
 we've got a place to go when we die
 and the architect resides right here
 we've got the american Jesus
 overwhelming millions every day
 (exercising his authority)
 he's the farmers barren fields
 the force the army wields
 the expession in the faces
 of the starving children
 the power of the man
 he's the fuel that drives the clan
 he's the motive and conscience
 of the murderer
 he's the preacher on t.v.
 the false sincerity
 the form letter that's written
 by the big computers
 he's the nuclear bombs
 and the kids with no moms

Out of the silent sea,
Came the holy men of war
Killers in the name of god, with bible,
Cross and book of law
Welcome to the land of ice,
Welcome to the land of snow..
Come in and meet our gods.
This is not your day

Nouskaa maasta maitten henget,

Tulten henget, soan henget,

Veden virrat, ilman pauhut,
Päälle vainomiesten päitten,

Rise now from the ground
Mighty spirits of the earth
Come down god of wind
Mighty spirit of the air
Rise now water of the seas
Drown all our enemies
Rise now god of fire
Burn and give back our land of dreams

You cannot run
You cannot hide
Everything they tell you
Is messing up your mind
They don't give up
And I don't give in
Boys are made for pleasure
And girls are made for sin
(CHORUS)
Excuses all around
They try to get you down saying
Come on baby show it
(come on baby show it)
Come in and meet the boys
(get down and see the toys)
But I don't wanna feel like
(I don't wanna feel like)
Any other girl
(any other girl)
You better look good
You've got to have height
All they do is drink and talk about the fight
Dancing is cute
And kissing is fun
But love is just a stormer
The game has just begun
Excuses all around
They try to get you down saying
Come on baby show it

We could promenade down infra-nasel depression.
The streets of your hands will never feel a recession.

Well, what do we expect
Paper hats?
Or maybe even roses?
The sounds of explosions?
Oh no, is this any easier?
Comfy? Climax? Ego?
Decorations up or down?
The sound of explosions?
What does this tune signify?
What is its meaning?
Is it really that straight forward?
Or are our ears beyond words?

We are all Romans, unconscious collective
We are all Romans, we live to regret it
We are all Romans and we know all about straight roads
Every straight road leads home, home to Rome

Four plus four equals eight
We organise via property as power
Slavehood and freedom, imperial purple
Pax Romana!
Suckled by a she wolf, we turn against our brother

Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered

I'm leaving here getting out of this place
Leaving here getting out of this place
Only certain kinds of people can take these things
Get up in the morning I'm paying my bills
Watching a storm cloud form over the hills
It appears I was waiting for my old self
I don't know what I'm made of or where from I came
Don't even seem to remember my name
Or why the ghost's alive in this cave
They say, she's on the run
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over
And thought then can turn action
And I dig and I dig and I dig and I dig
'Til my head is so sick and so clear
I'm leaving here getting out of this place
Leaving here getting out of this place
Only certain kinds of people can take these things
I'm tired and lost and feeling blown
Running around in a field, just out of my skull
How will I ever find my way home?

Tem que correr
Tem que suar
Tem que malhar
Vamos lá
Musculação
Respiração
Ar no pulmão
Vamos lá
Tem que esticar
Tem que dobrar
Tente encaixar
Vamos lá
Um, dois e três
É sem parar
Mais uma vez
Verão chegando
Quem não se endireitar
Não tem lugar ao sol
Domingo é dia de um tititi a mais
E de bumbum pra trás
Vem
Vem brilhar
Mas ser uma estrela sobre o sol
Estrelar mais
Ser mais brilhante do que o sol
Se mostrar
Mas se Deus no céu
Na Terra eu encantar mais
Ser tudo por um dia
Verão tá chegando
Eu quero correr, vou malhar
E perder alguns quilos
Pois também quero um lugar ao sol
À noite dançar
É que eu vou me acabar
Somente isso eu preciso
Pra noite compensar
Uau, uau, sensual
Como ela rebola
Com esse corpo ela pode
Até me endoidar
É inevitável o que ela faz
Pra te seduzir
Rebolando...

作词 : Cazuza, Frejat
Todo dia a insônia
Me convence que o céu
Faz tudo ficar infinito
E que a solidão é pretensão
De quem fica
Escondido fazendo fita
Todo dia tem a hora
Da sessão coruja,
Só entende quem namora
Agora vamo "bora",
Estamos meu bem
Por um triz
Pro dia nascer feliz!
O mundo acordar
E a gente dormir, dormir
Pro dia nascer feliz
Essa é a vida que eu quis
O mundo inteiro acordar
E a gente dormir
Todo dia é dia
E tudo em nome do amor
Essa é a vida que eu quis
Procurando vaga
Uma hora aqui, outra ali
No vai e vem
De teus quadris
Nadando contra corrente
Só pra exercitar
Todo o músculo que sente
Me dê de presente o teu bis
Pro dia nascer feliz
Essa é a vida que eu quis...
,
,Todos os dias quando acordo
,Não tenho mais o tempo que passou
,Mas tenho muito tempo
,Temos todo o tempo do mundo
,Todos os dias antes de dormir
,Lembro e esqueço como foi o dia
,"Sempre em frente
,Não temos tempo a perder."
,Nosso suor sagrado
,É bem mais belo que esse sangue amargo
,E tão sério
,E selvagem
,Selvagem
,Selvagem
,
,Veja o sol dessa manhã tão cinza:
,A tempestade que chega é da cor dos teus olhos
,Castanhos
,Então me abraça forte
,Me diz mais uma vez que já estamos
,Distantes de tudo
,Temos nosso próprio tempo
,Temos nosso próprio tempo
,Temos nosso próprio tempo
,Não tenho medo do escuro
,Mas deixe as luzes acesas
,Agora
,O que foi escondido é o que se escondeu
,E o que foi prometido
,Nem foi tempo perdido;
,Somos tão jovens
,Tão jovens
,Tão jovens
,
,Obrigado  essa é a música que eu mais gosto
,A letra que eu mais gosto
,A coisa que eu mais fico feliz de ter conseguido fazer
,Eu espero que o som esteja bom pra vocês
,E que vocês cantem com a gente
,
,ああ あなたを追って
,黄昏のBay City
,ああ めぐり逢えたら
,黙って抱きとめて
,
,煙草の香り 冷えきったKiss
,投げただけで あなたは消えた

,素直になれば つづいてた愛
,シーズン・オフの海は笑い
,風が凍るわ

,黄昏のBay City
,ああ あなたの好きな
,港が暮れてゆく
,
,若さはたぶん 見えないナイフ

,あなただけが この傷口
,ふさげる男よ
,
,空が海を 抱くみたいに
,愛し合えた奇跡を
,もう一度だけ…もう一度だけ…
,幻でいい
,

,
,When we look back at it all as i know we will
,You and me, wide eyed
,I wonder...
,Will we really remember how it feels to be this alive?
,
,And i know we have to go
,I realize we only get to stay so long
,Always have to go back to real lives
,Where we belong
,Where we belong
,Where we belong
,When we think back to all this and i'm sure we will
,Me and you, here and now
,Will we forget the way it really is
,Why it feels like this and how?
,
,And we always have to go i realize
,We always have to say goodbye
,Always have to go back to real lives
,
,But real lizes are the reason why
,We want to live another life
,We want to feel another time
,Another time...
,
,Yeah another time
,
,To feel another time...
,
,When we look back at it all as i know we will
,You and me, wide eyed
,I wonder...
,Will we really remember how it feels to be this alive?
,
,And i know we have to go
,I realize we always have to turn away
,Always have to go back to real lives
,
,But real lives are why we stay
,For another dream
,Another day
,For another world
,Another way
,For another way...
,
,One last time before it's over
,One last time before the end
,One last time to go again

,Cityscape skeletons
,Taking shape and growing skin
,Layer and layer is peeled away
,Exhausted
,From the repetition of always needing to rebuild
,Worn down faces in colorful barren places
,City lights and skylines
,Guiding home our wandering minds
,Tucking us into tortoise shells
,Suppressing the outside sounds of relentless consciousness
,Where is contemplative terrain that sleeps with the setting sun
,This nocturnal apathy
,Binging on shadow and smoke
,It's endlessly coming undone
,When the ground falls out who will take my hands
,When things fall apart who will take my hand
,I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
,You never knew how much I meant it in love
,Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
,Did you ever know how much I meant it
,Millions of tiny pieces looking in on themselves
,Reflected in the water
,Unaware of each other
,Every piece could find its place back in the puzzle
,What was one is shattered into many and longs to be whole again
,But nothing ever fits quite the same in the end
,I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
,You never knew how much I meant it in love
,I never thought that I could withstand falling short when I'm a broken man
,Every night I'm besides you weeks away when you're sleeping alone
,Did you ever know how much I meant it
,When the ground falls out who will take my hand
,When things fall apart who will take my hand
,
,I'm sick of living off of leaving all the things I thought I loved
,It's not the fact they all deceive I just believe a lying tongue
,And maybe I was built for the guilt that I let sink in
,But lately I would kill for the will that lived in me
,Would it be easier to turn away
,From all the things we've made
,Too afraid and I can't take it
,And down the road I know I'll miss your face
,And all the things we made
,Too afraid and I can't fake it
,And I don't mean to kill this dream we've got
,I'm used to lying through my teeth before the feeling seems to stop
,And maybe I can stay run away from the pain inside
,But lately I'm aware I don't care for the ones I leave behind
,Would it be easier to turn away
,From all the things we've made
,Too afraid and I can't take it
,And down the road I know I'll miss your face
,And all the things we made
,Too afraid and I can't fake it
,I'm so sorry she cut me deep
,And hope hasn't found me since
,Would it be easier to turn away
,From all the things we've made
,Too afraid and I can't take it
,Would it be easier to turn away
,From all the things we've made
,Too afraid and I can't take it
,And down the road I know I'll miss your face

We will live forever:
And if I were you I’d fear me more than death himself, because when I am through with all I’ll do you’ll wish to burn in motherfucking hell.
So let us open the gates of hell for the likes of you.
May God rest your soul when we are through.
This is our vengeance.
Orphan of broken dreams:
Your word isn’t what it seems.
You’re jealous and weak:
Stay humble and meek
And one day you might succeed.
Maybe one day I’ll probably make more of an impact than you’ll ever fake and I’ll take what is rightfully mine.
You ran away so I’m calling the shots this time.
I’ll take their hopes I’ll take their dreams I’ll take everything that would ever mean a single hint of trust from them you never cared so I will always win.
For every kid that you hear screaming loud and clear:
You left them in fear.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I ripped the tongue from his mouth and left him gasping for breath.
I told you that you’ll reap what you sow:
But you wanted fame
So fuck your ego.
How could you think this would go down so easy??
Your words are misleading blinded by the glare of the spotlight now your fiending.
How could you think this would go down so easy?
Well you can huff and you can puff and try and blow my house down,
But I take comfort in the fact that I have stolen your crown.
Go ahead with the childish games you play and at the end of the day we’ve got the final say.
I bet you never saw this coming
The tensions rise in your mind and you think back to realizing everything that you left behind.
The mask that you wear is just an illusion we’ve picked up our cross we’ve found a solution.
You’ve lost your flames in the darkest of night your ambitions are falling out of sight.
Selfishness owns you I hope you can see,
The family you loved is now the enemy.
We will live forever

,The weight of man is crushing me
,Bring forth the solace of your breeze
,From looming pines through ocean seas
,Oh Mother, I am breaking down
,Oh Mother, I call to you
,Ghost of the willows
,The weight of man is crushing me
,I am falling apart
,Broken into someone less than who I'm meant to be
,I am lost
,I am lost
,Bring forth the solace of your breeze
,From looming pines through the ocean seas
,Breathe life into these stagnant feet
,Restore the man that I'm meant to be
,Hanging beneath the nightmare we fall apart
,Hoping you'll call our names
,Sweet voice we'll follow
,In trying to preserve you (we fall apart

,小さかった日々の思い出はなくて僕一人だけが余り続けてた
,生まれ変われたら幸せになると試してみたのに楽になれず...
,何が起きたかも分からないまま離れ離れになる時間が来ても
,僕は何も出来ずに泣いてた
,ただ何度でも ただ何度でも
,この夢が叶うまでは迷わずに進んで行くと決めたから
,あの人に あの人達に
,この声が届くまでは抱えずに呼び続けるの
,
,遠くなった世界が忘れきれなくて失くした場所まで辿り着いたのに
,初めから僕を待ち受けてたのは追い求めてなどいない人で...
,全て投げ捨てて描けるのなら心ない言葉が苦しくても
,自分で自分に言い聞かせてた「僕は僕のままで」
,今 越えたくて 今 越えたくて
,まだ道が尽きるまでは崩れずに乗り切れると言えるから
,この僕に この僕達に
,まだ息が掛かるまでは壊れずに立ち続けるの
,
,Sometimes I watch the TV and hear family's voice
,But there was no one I knew there
,Even if I can't go back to those memories
,I will not run away from you
,
,必ず
,
,あと何年も 何十年も
,この唄が伝わるように思い出を交わせる日まで待っているから
,ただ何度でも ただ何度でも
,この夢が叶うまでは迷わずに進んで行くと決めたから
,あの人に あの人達に
,この声が届くまでは抱えずに呼び続けるの

,It started as love
,Love leads us to war
,Can I really care enough
,If you never cared at all?
,
,It's not the first
,And it wont be the last
,I'm an addict for a dramatic life
,It's written in my past
,
,'Cause I've seen that part of you
,Where I found the bitter truth
,There's nowhere left to hide
,That could save this life
,So I'll say goodbye to you
,
,Wherever you are
,You break and you scar
,You'll never get the best of me
,You'll never get that far
,
,As you're breaking down
,With no one around
,Think of how you got that way
,Remember who you are
,
,'Cause I've seen that part of you
,Where I found the bitter truth
,There's nowhere left to hide
,That could save this life
,So I'll say goodbye to you
,
,I've seen that part of you
,Where I saw the bitter truth
,
,In airs and graces
,Your changing faces
,I see it in everyone
,See it in everything
,Don't stand a chance in sobriety
,I can't escape you when I drink
,My entire being it swells and retracts
,When I think of
,How you went behind my back
,
,You finally found the guts
,To keep it honest for once
,Remember every lie
,Forget the family you gave up
,'Cause I've seen that part of you
,Where I found the bitter truth
,There's nowhere left to hide
,That could save this life
,So I'll say goodbye to you

,No, not now, not again
,Not much longer
,Every way words might
,Might or not, it's so high

,Let's make this last forever

,It's true, I feel the pressure
,Every time you're gone
,As long as we're together
,This moment last forever
,And what will she says
,Would my heart be torn
,Maybe there's some else to keep her warm
,Maybe she's too shy to comment
,Twenty one and too hard to call it

Like the ice on the lake 
Like the lights on a cave 
Like a new snowflake 
I am above, I am above where I belong 
Like the snap of a fire 
Like a vans in the quite 
Like a bird on the hill
I am above, I am above where I belong 
Like a state on your play 
Like a tax on this stage 
Like will to the faith 
I am above, I am above where I belong 
Like a 'to this ...
Like a sun in the view
Like the hate that just grove 
I am above, I am above where I belong 
Like the calm on a king 
Like a fountain to the faith
Like the leas to this spring 
I am above 
Like a fool on the hill 
And like Lord when it's real 
Like a wind when it's still
I am above, I am above where I belong 
Like a 'to this ...
Like a sun in the view
Like the hope that just grove 
I am above, 
Like the ..we keep 
Like all lies that we see
And we just have to say 
I am above, I am above where I belong

,Of a crowd and talked to you
,Said I liked your shoes
,
,You said thanks can I follow you?
,So it's up the stairs
,
,And out of view
,No prying eyes
,I poured some wine
,I asked your name you asked the time
,Now it's two o'clock,
,the club is closed we're up the block
,Your hands on me
,I'm pressing hard against your jeans
,Your tongue in my mouth
,Trying to keep the words from coming out
,You didn't care to know
,Who else may have been you before
,I want a lover I don't have to love
,I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
,Where's the kid with the chemicals?
,I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
,I got the money if you got the time
,You said it feels good I said I'll give it a try
,Then my mind went dark
,We both forgot where your car was parked
,Let's just take the train
,I'll meet up with the band in the morning
,Bad actors with bad habits
,Some sad singers
,They just play tragic
,And the phone's ringing
,And the van's leaving
,Let's just keep touching
,Let's just keep keep singing
,
,I want a lover I don't have to love
,I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
,Where's the kid with the chemicals
,
,I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
,I need some meaning I can memorize
,The kind I have always seems to slip my mind
,But you but you
,You write such pretty words
,But life's no story book
,Love's an excuse to get hurt
,And to hurt
,"Do you like to hurt?"
,"I do! I do!"
,"Then hurt me."

,On a string
,On a string
,On a string I was held
,The way I move, can you tell?
,My actions are orchestrated from above
,So I swing and I'll sway
,Wave my hand, kick my leg
,And it's always right with the music
,Until all that swaying starts to make you sick
,For a song, I was bought
,Now I lie when I talk
,With a careful eye on the cue cards
,Onto a stage, I was pushed
,With my sorrow well rehearsed
,So give me all your pity and your money now
,All of it
,We used to think that sound was something pure
,If I could act like this was my real life
,And not some cage where I've been placed
,Well then I could tell you the truth like I used to
,And not be afraid of sounding fake
,Now all everyone's listening for are the mistakes
,One, two, three
,One, two, three
,In a house by myself
,I hear the ice start to melt
,And I watched the rooftops weep for the sunlight
,And I know what must change
,Fuck my face, fuck my name
,They are brief and false advertisements
,For a soul, I don't have
,Something true I have lacked
,And spent my whole life trying to make up for
,But I found, in a song
,And in the people I love
,They will lift me up out of darkness
,And now my door, it stands open
,I'm inviting everyone in
,We're gonna laugh, we're gonna drink until the morning comes
,That's what we're gonna do come on

,Say you walk my way

,Doesn't matter what you say

,Hasn't anybody seen me lately

,
,Hasn't anybody seen me lately
,
,I'll tell you why
,
,I caught something made me so sick
,
,That I thought that I would die
,
,And I almost did too
,
,First me knees begin to tremble
,
,My heart begin to pound
,
,First my knees begin to tremble
,
,My heart begin to pound
,
,It was arrhythmic and out of tune
,
,I lost my equilibrium
,
,And fell face down upon the ground
,
,As I lay there on that cold pavement
,
,A tear ran down my face
,
,'Cause I thought I was dying
,
,You boys know I'm not a religious man
,
,But I sent a prayer out just in case
,
,You never know
,
,Lo and behold almost immediately
,I had reason to believe my prayer had
,Been heard in a very special place
,
,'Cause I heard this sound
,
,Yes
,
,Yes, it was harps and angels
,
,Harps and angels coming near
,
,I was to sick to roll over and see them
,But I could hear them singin ever so beautifully
,In my ear
,
,Then the sound began to subside
,And they sounded like background singers
,And a voice come down from the heavens above
,
,It was a voice full of anger from the Old Testament
,And a voice full of love from the New One
,And the street lit up like it was the middle of the day
,
,And I lay there quiet and listened thatto what
,Voice had to say
,
,He said, "You ain't ben a good man
,
,You ain't been a bad man
,
,But you've been pretty bad
,
,Lucky for you this ain't your time
,
,Someone very dear to me has made another clerical error
,
,And we're here on a bit of a wild goose chase
,But I want to tell you a few things
,That'll hold you in good stead when it is your time
,So you better listen close
,I'm only going to say this once
,
,When they lay you on the table
,
,Better keep your bussines clean
,
,'Fore they lay you on the table
,
,Better keep your business clean
,
,Don't want no back stabbing, ass grabbing
,You know exactly what I mean
,
,Alright girls - we're outta here"
,
,"Encore. Encore."
,
,spoke
,
,"Tres bien Encore"
,
,And off they went into the night
,
,Almost immediately I felt better
,And I come round to see you boys
,
,'Cause you know we ain't living right
,And while it was fresh
,I wanted to tell you what he told me
,
,He said, "When the lay you on the table
,
,Better keep your business clean
,
,When they lay you on the table
,
,Better keep your business clean
,
,Else there won't be no harps and angels
,Coming for you
,It'll be trombones, kettle drums, pitchforks,
,And tambourines."
,
,Sing it like they did for me one time
,
,Yes
,
,Beautiful
,
,Wish I spoke French
,
,So actually the main thing about this story is for me
,
,There really is an afterlife
,
,And I hope to see all of you there

,When the morning's rising and looking on me
,When the night comes knocking and knocking on me
,I say I ain't the one

,Give out, give up
,Give out, give up give in

,
,I was better than I felt in years
,Then I looked to the streets and I looked to my fears
,I know something was going round these tears
,I was hurting people, so close to me
,
,I spent ten long years feeling so fucking bad
,I know you cheated on me but I cheated on myself
,I was falling way out when she sent those pictures off
,And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her
,And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her
,And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her

,
,Take it even further back to darker times
,When I drank too much and I took too much
,I lied to all my friends about who I was
,But Caitlin listen to me now I’m all grown up
,
,I spent two long years just losing my mind
,Thank you Kristian for keeping me clean
,And we’re painted like the warriors
,And we’re painted like the warriors
,And we’re painted like the warriors
,And we’re painted like the warriors
,
,You gotta heal...

,I was the guard in the rations room
,Hungry as a hippopotamus
,The favorite child of some loony tunes
,The scoundrel of my inheritance
,For all those on the shoes of truth
,I thought I was the heaviest breather
,I want to check if I heard you right
,I want you to swear on your mamma and Jesus
,For all those on the shoes of truth
,I thought I was the heaviest breather
,I was not
,
,Promiscuous as a thought
,The lingua franca of the heart
,After drinking ourselves blind
,Feeling we proceeded
,For all those on the shoes of truth
,I thought I was the heaviest breather
,Huffing and puffing
,The swan song of the nothing
,I am not what I once was

,I could only see everything that was wrong
,Because I don't understand where I am right now
,I'm full of empty cans I just can't throw out
,And I've been living life like a pendulum
,Swinging side to side, never moving on

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me, an overfed long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hm
But there I was, mm
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I thought to myself, what could that mean?
Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said
Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl, uh-huh, uh-huh
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Take that pearl, yeah
It's all yours
All you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah, yeah, oh, uh-huh
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Take that pearl
It's all yours

Down in the graveyard out of sight
I've got to hold my head and say my prayers
And hope to get my feelings right
Tonight's the night
I don't feel sorry, feel detached
Girl if you took me back
You know that I would let you go without a scratch
Hey, there's a catch
I'm going to kill you
I'm going to kill you dead, ha
I'm going to kill you dead
I had a strategy, made a move, oh
But you screamed so loud
I don't know how you think that someone's saving you
There ain't no use
I had a weapon, it's a knife
And now I'm standing right above you
I'll still love you on the other side my future wife
I'm going to kill you
I'm going to kill you dead, ha
I'm going to kill you dead

,Hans Zimmer-The Well
,By an old drinking well on the grass so green
,I lay down and fell into a dream
,By a strange mellow sound from a silver eyed bird
,I opened my eyes but said no word
,On the pathway came walking a woman so bold
,Behind her in silence went the old
,Ahead ran the children with joyful cries
,Their faces were lifted to the sky
,The woman's hair was raven and black as the night
,Covered with stars shining bright
,As they passed by the well I saw that their eyes
,Were flaming like many coloured ice They passed by the well like a breeze pure and clean
,Soon they were nowhere to be seen
,When I woke up alone on the grass so green
,I looked into the well to catch the dream
,The water was rising and I felt a chill
,I willed the water to be still
,There was a face in the mirror like a face out of time
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,There was a face in the mirror and the face wasn't mine
,The eyes held a shimmery shine Hans Zimmer

Down by the river we met with empty hands 
By the boarded shelter 
We turned our backs to the desert land 
There must be something out there 
A shock to kill the boredom 
As the smoke kicked high from the factory fires 
They never heard the siren calling 
It takes one 
To make one 
It takes time 
To kill time 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Last by the river we left with empty hands 
By the border station 
We were blown by the western wind too long 
There must be something out there 
A shock to kill the boredom 
As the smoke kicked high from the factory fires 
We never heard the siren calling 
It takes one 
To make one 
It takes time 
To kill time 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 
Stripped like wire, stripped left open and bare 
Board this train, board this train to nowhere 

,Now the king told the boogie men
,You have to let that raga drop
,The oil down the desert way
,Has been shakin\' to the top
,The shiek he drove his Cadillac
,He went a\' cruisnin\' down the ville
,The muezzin was a\' standing
,On the radiator grille
,The shareef don\'t like it
,Rockin\' the Casbah
,Rock the Casbah
,The shareef don\'t like it
,Rockin\' the Casbah
,Rock the Casbah
,By order of the prophet
,We ban that boogie sound
,Degenerate the faithful
,With that craazy Casbah sound
,But the Bedouin they brought out
,The electric camel drum
,The local guitar picker
,Got his guitar picking thumb
,As soon as the shareef
,Had cleared the square
,They began to wail
,Now over at the temple
,Oh! They really pack \'em in
,The in crowd say it\'s cool
,To dig this chanting thing
,But as the wind changed direction
,The temple band took five
,The crowd caught a wiff
,Of that crazy Casbah jive
,The king called up his jet fighters
,He said you better eaarn your pay
,Drop your bombs between the minarets
,Down the Casbah way
,As soon as the shareef was
,Chauffeured outta there
,The jet pilots tuned to
,The cockpit radio blare
,As soon as the shareef was

作词 : Chevron
The island, it is silent now
But the ghosts still haunt the waves
And the torch lights up a famished man
Who fortune could not save
Did you work upon the railroads?
Did you rid the streets of crime?
Were your dollars from the White House?
Were they from the five and dime?
Did the old songs taunt or cheer you
And did they still make you cry?
Did you count the months and years
Or did your teardrops quickly dry?
Ah, no, says he, 'twas not to be
On a coffin ship, I came here
And I never even got so far
That they could change my name
Thousands are sailing
Across the western ocean
To a land of opportunity
That some of them will never see
Fortune prevailing
Across the western ocean
Their bellies full, their spirits free
They'll break the chains of poverty
And they'll dance
In Manhattan's desert twilight
In the death of afternoon
We stepped hand-in-hand down Broadway
Like the first man on the moon
And &quot;The Blackbird&quot; broke the silence
As you whistled it so sweet
And in Brendan Behan's footsteps
I danced up and down the street
Then we said goodnight to Broadway
Giving it our best regards
Tipped our hats to Mr. Cohen
Dear old Time Square's favorite bard
Then we raised a glass to JFK
And a dozen more besides
When I got back to my empty room
I suppose I must have cried
Thousands are sailing
Again across the ocean
Where the hand of opportunity
Draws tickets in a lottery
Postcards we're mailing
Of sky-blue skies and oceans
From rooms the daylight never sees
Where lights don't glow on Christmas trees
And we dance to the music and we dance
Thousands are sailing
Across the western ocean
Where the hand of opportunity
Draws tickets in a lottery
Where e'er we go, we celebrate
The land that makes us refugees
From fear of priests with empty plates
From guilt and weeping effigies
And we dance to the music and we dance 

If you see a faded sign at the side of the road that says "15 miles to the Love Shack" 
Love Shack, yeah, yeah 
I'm headin' down the 
Atlanta highway 
Lookin' for the love getaway 
Headed for the love getaway 
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale 
And we're headin' on down to the 
Love Shack 
I got me a 
Chrysler, it seats about 20 
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money 
The love shack is a little old place where we can get together 
Love Shack, baby (a-Love Shack, baby) 
Love Shack, baby, 
Love Shack 
Love Shack, baby, 
Love Shack 
Love Shack, baby, 
Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at) 
Love Shack, baby, 
Love Shack (Love, baby, that's where it's at) 
Sign says (woo) "Stay away, fools" '
Cause love rules at the 
Love Shack 
Well, it's set way back in the middle of a field 
Just a funky old shack and

People said we couldn't play 
The called us foul-mothed yobs 
But the only notes that really count 
Are the ones that come in wads 
They all drowned when the air turned blue '
Cos we didn't give a toss 
Filthy lucre, ain't nothing new 
But we all get cash from the chaos 
The time is right to do it now 
The greatest rock'n'roll swindle 
The time is right to do it now 
E.M.I. said you're out of hand 
And they gave us the boot 
But they couldn't sack us, just like that 
Without giving us the loot 
Thank you kindly 
A & M They said we were out of bounds 
But that ain't bad for two weeks work 
And 75,000 pounds 
The time is right to do it now 
The greatest rock'n'roll swindle 
The time is right to do it now 
The time is right to do it now 
The greatest rock'n'roll swindle 
The time is right to do it now 
I just wanna play with my hand 
Are you good enough for me 
Hiya boys 
I'm the choosen one 
Can't you fucking see 
I'm a jealous god and 
I want everything 
And I love you with a knife 
I'll take you, if you're ready for me 
And I'll give you my life 
The time is right to do it now 
The greatest rock'n'roll swindle 
The time is right to do it now 
The time is right for 
Nickey's Special 
The greatest rock'n'roll star 
The time is right for me, now!

Sen dog: pa la salud!
B-real: pa la salud!... primero yo
Sen dog: primero usted...
B-real: *grrrrrah!*
B-real and sen dog: *mexican yells*
B-real: hora hora, quien está...
Sen dog: cómetelo!
(verse 1: sen dog)
Down for my barrio, enter my villa!
Tha hill called thrill, drinkin' over your area!
Makin' my queso down en méxico
Where the sun burns hot and then goes and downslow
Got my clan tell so everythin' is well
Got a villa in a mile, with the big spanish spell
And let it be know, that i'm down for tha tranza!
The brown rapin'hood, lookin' out for tha raza
See me in my ranfla on street bala poof
A can with stanboor, con crane no the loop
Try to pull us up but i got my soldados
Tha soul asesinos vienen preparados
Tha rappers desperados, with the fool on the claro
You know when we say 'get the money en tha mano!
Get the cash me in the desk call up my hermano
We all can jump down in the red-gusano...!
Chorus:
Tequila sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money *edited*!
(verse 2: b-real)
I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'til i met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad woof, for tha cock out
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
That was slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen
You got that? getting your cup, i took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shhh...
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what i say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why women and money don't mix? like drinking and driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and see daekin' clown you
Keep your shhh in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
(chorus)
(verse 3: b-real)
Tequila sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by surprise
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, bethler brother, while you burn, you'll be stoped
Better kill me, don't let me return, *edited*
Trust no man, cause i'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ace in hand, i want it all
I recall the words from jesus, you are the juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a big sip, caution it, but i never lie...
(chorus)
B-smooth: tequila...
Sen dog: eat tha worm ese... eat tha *edited*
Allways quieren ese... es como coahuila homie...

Favole affrante e vuote di malinconia
Nebbia che affonda giorni e solidarietà
Ci dicon son precarie nuvole e utopia
Ma là nella metropoli sprofonda la realtà
Senza filtri nelle strade passeggia il buffone
Salta sopra i cocci di un’ormai sorda città
Non c’è spazio per compianto né moderazione
A chi ha straziato i suoi valori per cieca tranquillità
Non correte, non scappate via
Un giorno non può vivere senza la sua utopia
Non correte, non scappate via
Nel nulla del benessere svendete la vostra viltà
Tra voli disperati di fantasmi e falsi giorni
Non correte non scappate via
Svegliatevi pagliacci prima o poi
Come farete senza sogni
Certo un buffone non sarà di compagnia
Al vegliardo che coi sogni non sa più parlar
Per chi la carovana è ormai sfuggita via
Il prezzo dell’orgoglio è nell’errore sprofondar
Ma nelle poltrone armate di menefreghismo
Striscia un canto vuoto d’idee senza identità
Dicon “Non sarà poi male un po’ di opportunismo”
Grazie ma declino ho troppo a cuore la mia integrità
Signori spettatori
Un altro treno è ripartito
Io vi lascio il testamento di un amore che la sua vita ha inseguito
Col sorriso ripartirò con voi
Avanti avvicinatevi e nel cuore nessuno si vergogni
Guardate guardate su non scappate via
Qui c’è un buffone armato di poesia che danza ancora coi suoi sogni
:::ENGLISH TEXT:::
TESTAMENT OF A CLOWN
Among broken tales, melancholy and void
The fog submerges days and solidarity
They tell us clouds and utopia are precarious
But in the cities reality is sinking
Unbound the clown takes to the streets
He leaps on the rubble of a deafened city
There’s no room for grief or moderation
For those who have done away with their values for a blind tranquillity
Don’t run, don’t flee
A day cannot live without utopia
Don’t run, don’t flee
In the mud of opulence you sell vileness
Among the desperate leap of ghosts and false days
Don’t run, don’t flee
You better wake up you clowns sooner or later
What will you do without any dreams?
No doubt a clown will be of little company
For a geezer who know not how to speak through dreams
For those for whom the caravan has already gone
The price of pride lies in the error of sinking
But on the armchairs armed with indifference
An empty song crawls, devoid of ideas and identity
They say: “A little opportunism will do little harm”
Thanks but no thanks, I hold my integrity too dear
Ladies and gentlemen
Another train has left
I leave you the testament of a love followed by a dream
Smiling I will leave again with you
Draw near and let no one be ashamed
Look! Look and don’t flee
Here’s a clown armed with poetry who still dances with his dreams
Una mattina mi son svegliato,
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
Una mattina mi son svegliato,
e ho trovato l'invasor.
O partigiano, portami via,
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
O partigiano, portami via,
ché mi sento di morir.
E se io muoio da partigiano,
(E se io muoio sulla montagna)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
E se io muoio da partigiano,
(E se io muoio sulla montagna)
tu mi devi seppellir.
E seppellire lassù in montagna,
(E tu mi devi seppellire)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
E seppellire lassù in montagna,
(E tu mi devi seppellire)
sotto l'ombra di un bel fior.
Tutte le genti che passeranno,
(E tutti quelli che passeranno)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
Tutte le genti che passeranno,
(E tutti quelli che passeranno)
Mi diranno «Che bel fior!»
(E poi diranno «Che bel fior!»)
«È questo il fiore del partigiano»,
(E questo è il fiore del partigiano)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
«È questo il fiore del partigiano,
(E questo è il fiore del partigiano)
morto per la libertà!»

One morning I awakened
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
One morning I awakened
And I found the invader
Oh partisan carry me away
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
Oh partisan carry me away
Because I feel death approaching
And if I die as a partisan
(And if I die on the mountain)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
And if I die as a partisan
(And if I die on the mountain)
Then you must bury me
Bury me up in the mountain
(And you have to bury me)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
Bury me up in the mountain
(And you have to bury me)
Under the shade of a beautiful flower
And the people who shall pass
(And all those who shall pass)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
And the people who shall pass
(And all those who shall pass)
Will tell me: \"what a beautiful flower\"

This is the flower of the partisan

,
Nel brusco avvento della rugiada
Intono ultima tenzon
Giacche' diritta strada
Perse la mia generazion
E desto il verso di un far giocondo
Tra sonni di virtu'
Scorse un deserto dove
Il sol non si distingeva piu'
Crollando sempre piu' giu'
Andando sempre piu' giu'
Solito ad aspettar
Uno schiaffo dal fondo
Per poi ricominciar
E andare ancora piu' giu'
Trascinare piu' giu'
La terra del mio natal
Che in cerca di virtu'
Scendo per affamar
E or qui commedia non ride piu'
Marcata dalla realta'
Biasimai orge di mafie e nani
Affannati in eternita'
Dall'obbedir come cani
Ed anelar culi da leccar
E nel vagar mio conobbi a stento
Giovantenne nudo a scappar
Da belta' a pagamento
E mecenati in servile eta'
Qui ti invoco mia provvidenza
A dispensarmi dal leggere
Poiche' ignoro differenza
Tra puttane e suoi lacche'
Al finire di un'esistenza
Culla di amenita'
Cresciute in astinenza
E mai temprate da sazieta'
E or eccomi in un limbo immune da credute idee
Paradiso in un inferno di terrena eta'
A ripondere che non cadde invan
Il rischio di partire per un mondo a immagine
Di chi poi sapra' quanto puo' valer
Un sonno per svegliar
Incanti di un nuovo resistere 

Mi pana, carnal 

Venimos de Madrid en este nuestro tren 
railes musicales que nos llevan y nos traen 
nuestro diapasón es la contrainformación 
desahógate bailando ska 

Bailando ska 
con agresividad 
Bailando ska 
y con sinceridad 

Mi pana, carnal 

Viajamos sin control y sin autoridad 
a la única estación que se llama libertad 
somos el altavoz que despierta la conciencia 
desahógate bailando ska 

Bailando ska 
con agresividad 
Bailando ska 
y con sinceridad 

Mi pana, chaval, colega, carnal 

Ska-pa, skapate 
al fondo hay un sitio, sube a nuestro tren 
Ska-pa, ska-pa, ska-pa 
desengáñate 

Es la educación la única canción 
la pedagogía, la más dulce melodía 
Cambiemos los valores de una sociedad podrida 
Pongamos rumbo fijo y a volar 

Bailando ska 
con agresividad 
Bailando ska 
y con sinceridad 

Ska-pa, skapate 
al fondo hay un sitio, sube a nuestro tren 
Ska-pa, ska-pa, ska-pa 
desengáñate 

Es la música la que nos hace sentir libres 
escapando de las mentiras de un mundo patentado 
donde el 1% de la población es la que domina al resto 
organízate y lucha, somos el 99% 

Y viajarás y viajaré 
sin apearnos de este tren 
y soñaré y soñarás 
tarareando algún ska 
Sin dejar de bailar, sin dejar de reír 
te prometo resistir 
y pelear por un mundo mejor, quiero vivir 
BAILANDO SKA
La inflación, malversación
De los fondos de la nación
Las drogas, el alcoho, el paro, la corrupción
Todo esto ya se acabó

Ya llegan las elecciones, me tienes que votar
Ya está aquí el salvador
¡que bonitas palabras digo en televisión!
Marketing de salón

No nos deis la vara con el rollo de siempre
Anda, ponte el mono y vete al
"tajo" aver que sientes

Te abrazaré, te besaré
A mil niños tendré que coger
Vota aquí, vota allá, vótame, vótale...
Todos locos por el poder

¿que tiene la moncloa que les hace olvidar

Que fuí yo quien les voté?
Izquieras o derechas, todos quieren pastel
Cumplid con vuestro deber

No nos deis la vara...
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
Bla, bla, bla y más bla
Si tu bla, yo más bla, tu bla bla yo bla bla
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla

Las horas son eternas en el sucio corredor
Pensando con detalle en mi ejecucion
El tiempo se me acaba y no lo puedo detener
Eh brother, welcome to hell

He sido condenado a la pena capital
Alego mi inocenciay no lo quieren ver
Eh brother, welcome to hell

Condenan a dementes o a menores de edad
En la silla de la muerte o en la camara de gas
A cuantos inocentes he visto perecer
Eh brother, welcome to hell
Vivo en un pais donde todo puedes comprar
Estar vivo o estar muerto depende del capital
Mi futiro ya esta escrito no me puedo defender
Eh brother, welcome to hell

Cuantos seres humanos tendreis que asesinar
Para daros cuenta que esto es une atrocidad
El ojo por ojo nada puede resolver
Eh brother, welcome to hell
Al cabo de los anos consiguieron demostran
Que yo no era culpable y ya no hay marcha atras
Mi cuerpo esta podrido y ya no puedo renacer

Él nació en la calle, no pudo elegir 
entre escombros y basuras tuvo que vivir 
la calle le hizo fuerte, allí se rebeló 
y es que, tío, no hay dinero. 
¡ ES UN GATO OBRERO&nbsp;! 
Su madre callejera, su padre siamés 
tiene veinte hermanos en ¡CARABANCHEL! 
busca en la basura algo que comer 
y es que, tío, no hay dinero. 
¡ ES UN GATO OBRERO&nbsp;! 
López es algo especial 
desde cachorrito ya bailaba ska, 
sus botas, su chaleco y su forma de andar, 
no está domesticado, es un gato ska. 
SIGUE, sigue, SIGUE, sigue, SIGUE, síguelo 
SIGUE, sigue, SIGUE, sigue, RESISTE LÓPEZ. 
Flaco, desnutrido, tiene que comer 
le quita las pelas a los gatos bien 
perros policía van detrás de él 
y es que, tío, no hay dinero. 
¡ VENGA EL MONEDERO&nbsp;! 
La sociedad gatuna no le quiso entender 
por eso se rebela y grita: ¡QUE LES DEN BIEN! 
es un reflejo claro de la sociedad 
y es que, tío, no hay dinero. 
¡ ES UN GATO OBRERO&nbsp;!

,Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
,But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
,Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
,When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough-nough
,
,Been a fool, girl I know
,Didn't expect this is how things would go
,Maybe in time, you'll change your mind

,
,I live with are numberless
,
,Little white flowers
,
,Will never awaken you
,
,Not where the black coach
,
,Of sorrow has taken you
,
,Angels have no thought
,
,Of ever returning you
,
,Would they be angry
,
,If I thought of joining you?

,And prayers that are sad

,I know, let them not weep
,
,Let them know that I'm glad to go

,Are you so narrow minded that you never stopped to think
,
,Two steps past this fleeting moment or what a life could mean?
,And you can't stand the thought that you were wrong
,Blaming all those who were never at fault
,Take a step aside and tiptoe past lines
,So rehearsed to convince yourself you are fine
,If there was even a chance could you still bring yourself to turn away
,Cold feet dripping ice into your veins
,Is it second nature just to throw a guiltless life aside?
,You built yourself up, the pain still burns in your eyes
,
,Where are you now? Was this not your home?
,Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
,Can you stand to look in the mirror?
,Where are you now? Are you alone?
,You said you'd never leave
,Tell me was it easy
,
,So you mean to say that I only got in the way
,Of your plans and dreams, your selfish schemes?
,You took this life for granted but it was never yours to take
,Point to the possibility of everything you took from me
,I hope you know how it feels to be alone
,
,You'll know what it is to be alone
,Can you live with the mistakes you've made?
,Does it sting to think I'll never know your name?
,You're to blame
,
,Where are you now? Was this not your home?
,Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
,Can you stand to look in the mirror?
,Where are you now? Are you alone?
,You said you'd never leave
,Tell me was it easy
,
,Where are you now? How long has it been
,Since you have heard my name?
,And how long will you treat this like a game?
,Where are you now and what will it take
,For it to go my way? There's gotta be a better way
,
,A better way
,It's not your voice I'm looking for now
,And these halls I pass never meant much with you around
,I'm becoming something that you never will
,Stop and take a look around
,This ship's not going down
,
,But you're not around
,You never even said goodbye
,
,Where are you now? Was this not your home?
,Guess I'll step up and be the man that you never were
,Can you stand to look in the mirror?
,Where are you now? Are you alone?
,You said you'd never leave
,Tell me was it easy
,
,It started as love
,Love leads us to war
,Can I really care enough

,Don't stand a chance in sobriety
,I can't escape you when I drink

,Where I found the bitter truth
,There's nowhere left to hide
,That could save this life
,So I'll say goodbye to you
,
,
,
,These shallow thoughts are flowing quickly to an end from your mouth
,But did you know that you're drowning my dreams in your doubt
,Take time to see what you are and what you're doing to me
,Does shutting me down pushing me out make you feel free
,You're just another stone in my way
,But you won't become a brick that I lay
,Placing the path in front of me to reach the goals that I seek
,Trace back the lines we've drawn and picture what this life could be
,
,If I could find a way to turn back time
,I won't change you can't change me
,Why would you even try?
,Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
,Everything that you think I will never be
,
,It feels like every time I speak you turn my words around on me
,So I'm treading carefully always afraid to breathe
,Leave me be and let me reach all of the things that you don't believe
,I could ever hold in my hands
,How could you ever hope to understand?
,Trace back the lines we've drawn and picture what this life could be
,If I could find a way to turn back time
,I won't change you can't change me
,Why would you even try?
,Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
,Everything that you think I will never be
,
,There's a good chance that I've made too many mistakes to ever redeem myself
,But if I spend my whole life trying to fix the past then I might as well
,Give up hope of happiness and the will to go on
,I'd rather find fulfillment in what I am than be lost in what I'll never get back
,They say my dreams only last till the end of the night
,But if you'd open your eyes you'd see they carry to the morning light
,I don't need sleep to live my dreams so stay the hell away from me
,
,If I could find a way to turn back time
,I won't change you can't change me
,Why would you even try?
,Take your words and walk away because I stand to hear say
,Everything that you think I will never be
,
,Some days I feel like a loaded gun
,I paint a target on everyone
,
,Get off your knees 'coz I'm telling you
,What's done is done
,What will you do?
,Will you run?
,
,You think you're running away
,I think you're running in place
,Run!
,I've never seen you this way
,Do not pray for an easy life
,Search for the strength to walk the line
,I see a hope that's hard to find
,So don't run away
,Away
,
,Some days I feel like I'm fucking done
,I'm waging war against everyone
,It's killing me like it's killing you
,What's done is done
,What will you do?
,Will you run?

,When I wake up I'm thankful I slept through the night

,And if you only knew
,what I have given up for this
,I'll be there for you

,I never thought that things could turn around so quickly
,And never leave a trace of where we've been or where we're going
,I think I've crossed the line this time,
,A fantastic mistake to make us wonder why
,We ever followed what they said
,We should have chased our hearts instead
,Broken stares, longing hearts
,Moving along as we start,
,To ignore these thoughts that keep us here
,Hoping hands, reach so far
,To find a way to begin
,Baby why do we hold love in
,Whispering words so softly into your lips
,Hold this secret close to your chest before it slips
,And fades away
,Be sure to round up your reasons
,While you deny the fact that you
,Can never settle down
,While your bags are still packed
,Broken stares, longing hearts
,Moving along as we start,
,To ignore these thoughts that keep us here
,Hoping hands, reach so far
,To find a way to begin
,Baby why do we hold love in
,Now we're alone, our feelings we cannot control
,We've lost all our maps so darling where do we go?
,How do we make it all okay,
,Baby just tell me what to say
,What's going through your head I just don't know and its killing me
,I just need to know that this is real
,You brought back something I lost in myself
,I think I forgot how to feel
,Don't say, baby don't say this was never my place(Please don't, just don't)
,Just take my hand and come back to me(Put me through hell)
,I can't say this is the same
,But I will change
,Why do we broken stares, longing hearts
,Moving along as we start,
,To ignore these thoughts that keep us here
,And I don't know why(I don't know why)
,We wait
,To say what's on our minds
,Why do we hold love in

  Won't you scream my name?
 For the first time (for the first time)
 For the last time (for the last time)
 
 As I lay down my life before you! 
 
 The hiding place where I sought out your eyes 
 Screaming outwards to shoot me back in time
 You sent me out in the right field
 Spilled my words and disguise 
 We're starting a rise
 Now it's so true I can't go on without you by my side 
 Every night we die 
 Hold my breath just to see your ghost
 I hold it in my hand for you
 
 Won't you scream my name?
 For the first time (for the first time)
 For the last time (for the last time)
 
 And I regret the moments I gave you! 
 
 Searching for my plans to devour you 
 I finally found out the truth 
 You sent me out in the right field 
 Spilled my words and disguise 
 We're starting a rise
 Now it's so true I can't go on without you by my side
 Every night we die
 
 Let go of the wires! 
 Let go of the wires! 

作曲 : Skylit Drive
I'll find you out
 Replacements are overrated
 It's been said once or twice now
 Silently we reach the day
 The secret's out now
 With your eyes in the back of your head
 Can you see it's me?
 And I will find a way to hunt you down
 I'll go to every niche and corner of this town
 
 I won't stop until the bleeding all has run out
 Remember what you said about being a friend now?
 The movement in her hips strikes the hour when the poison sets in
 How do you wake?
 How do you sleep at night?
 Remember what you said
 
 I know where you are
 Plan your escape
 Do exactly as I say
 Some odd years now... comply
 Fight for your chance at life
 They'll never find out where I buried you
 
 I will force you to sit upright with access to your heart
 Now is your time to plea
 Say it, "set me free!"
 Set me free
 
 Remember what you said about being a friend now?
 The movement in her hips strikes the hour when the poison sets in
 How do you wake?
 How do you sleep at night?
 Remember what you said

,Is it too late to take back what we say?
,You tell me don't tell me that we're all the same
,How can you say that you don't believe in anything?
,When all the signs are sitting right in your face
,How can I give you my trust when you're just stuck in the past?
,Building up walls place hope in a stronghold that will never last
,Are you blind to the fact that you're just being used?
,Or could it be that you just crave the abuse?
,Is it too late to take back what we say?
,You tell me don't tell me that we're all the same
,How can you say that you don't believe in anything?
,When all the signs are sitting right in your face
,All of the words that I've ignored for so long
,I've convinced my self that they were all wrong
,Searching and hoping just to see
,A glimmer of truth in your dishonesty
,I think I'm losing myself to this illusion that I've created of you
,Don't try to tell me what this means when you've turned you back on everything
,Is it too late to take back what we say?
,You tell me don't tell me that we're all the same
,How can you say that you don't believe in anything?
,When all the signs are sitting right in your face
,You can't play the victim while playing yourself
,Victim or villain you've made your own hell
,Never thought your conscience would eat you alive
,You can't hide what you've been holding inside
,How can you say that you don't believe in anything?
,How can you run from the ones who help who breathe?
,I know this may be the fate that you've earned
,But who am I to say what you deserve
,You set fire to another bridge with each day that passes
,You'd watch this whole world burn to be king of the ashes
,I'm reaching for something that does not exist in you
,Running to the light but you'll never find the truth
,Is it all just a game or are you empty inside?
,Is there any hope left or have your dreams all died?
,
,Close your eyes
,get a grip
,You feel yourself start to slip
,Losing ground before you even found your feet
,The chance is knocking at your door

,You've set yourself up for failure
,So don't be surprised when you fall down
,If you don't have something to reach for
,Then tell me tell me
,what's the point of it all
,Burning through time wasting your life
,Falling short of the things that you admire
,With all your hopes just out of touch
,But the cost of those thoughts just seems too much
,It's all in your hands
,you just have to pull yourself up
,Past the doubt that holds you down
,You're struggling to make a sound
,Keeping your time bottled
,As if you have some control
,With your life mapped out afraid of the unknown
,You've set yourself up for failture
,So don't be surprised when you fall down
,If you don't have something to reach for
,Then tell me tell me
,what's the point of it all
,tell me tell me
,tell me what's the point of it all
,tell me tell me
,tell me what's the point of it all
,They say for each step forward
,You take three steps back
,What's the point of progress with two feet in the past
,With yourself this deep
,There's only four left to go
,To find your future still buried below
,You've set yourself up for failure
,So don't be surprised
,So don't be surprised
,You've set yourself up for failure
,So don't be surprised when you fall down
,If you don't have something to reach for

,Lets go!
,Yeah,
,for those of you that want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all (c'mon!)
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,He doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
,But fuck em, he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,It's all about reality and making some noise
,Makin the story - makin sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up! let's go!
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status but still leavin them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because he makes a livin from writin raps
,Put it together himself, now the picture connects
,Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,He's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin his way to the top
,People think its a common owners name
,People keep askin him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No he's livin proof, Got him rockin the booth
,He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent
,Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
,Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?!
,Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow
,Now the record with the Virgins takin over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
,You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,
,There comes a time when all else fails
,You put the pressure on me how can I prevail?
,This weight I carry keeps piling on
,He is not the one, love blinds what's right from wrong
,What's right from wrong
,Watch their lust it sparks alive
,And it tears me up inside
,I'll admit I'm terrified
,Jealousy is my new guide
,I must reside, I must abide
,Live out my life caught in a lie
,But I might die, if I don't try
,I try to find as I search my mind
,Will you take his hand and leave me behind?
,The aisle clears as my hope eludes
,He's burning through my fucking solitude
,Watch their lust it sparks alive
,And it tears me up inside
,I'll admit I'm terrified
,Jealousy is my new guide
,I must reside, I must abide
,Live out my life caught in a lie
,But I might die, if I don't try
,I'm so sick of this romantic tragedy (this tragedy!)
,I'm plunging head first to insanity (insanity!)
,He's come to stay and I never said that it was okay
,His broken words won't make this right, I can see straight through all his lies
,This can't be real I don't care how he makes her feel
,This is not his place and in any case he can pack up and get out of my face!
,Watch their lust it sparks alive
,And it tears me up inside
,I'll admit I'm terrified
,Jealousy is my new guide
,I must reside, I must abide
,Live out my life caught in a lie
,But I might die, if I don't try
,Die young!
,Can we stop this wedding?
,He is not her other, I'm her only one
,Back off!
,He holds her safe and sound
,Even now, while she's caught in his whisper!
,So you think you got me figured out
,Why don't you go ahead and tell me what I'm all about
,You know I'm dying to hear it
,I'm gettin' sick of all the sticks and stones you throw
,Now it feels like it's opinion overload
,I can take it but I'd rather leave it
,Get out of my face
,Quit bringing me down

,Do you ever feel like breaking down?
,Do you ever feel out of place?
,Like somehow you just don't belong
,And no one understands you
,Do you ever wanna run away?
,Do you lock yourself in your room?
,With the radio on turned up so loud
,That no one hears you screaming
,No you don't know what it's like
,When nothing feels alright
,You don't know what it's like to be like me
,To be hurt
,To feel lost
,To be left out in the dark
,To be kicked
,When you're down

,To be on the edge of breaking down
,And no one's there to save you
,No you don't know what it's like
,Welcome to my life
,Do you wanna be somebody else?
,Are you sick of feeling so left out?
,Are you desperate to find something more
,Before your life is over?
,Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
,Are you sick of everyone around?
,With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
,While deep inside you're bleeding
,No you don't know what it's like
,When nothing feels alright
,You don't know what it's like to be like me
,To be hurt

,And no one's there to save you
,No you don't know what it's like
,Welcome to my life
,No one ever lies straight to your face
,And no one ever stabbed you in the back
,You might think I'm happy
,But I'm not gonna be ok!
,Everybody always gave you what you wanted
,You never had to work it was always there
,You don't know what it's like
,What it's like!

I’ve lingered for far too long in the shallows of this water.

A body, cold and constant, embraces the gift of a daughter.

To be wrapped in the arms of a tormenting giant.

She is carried with an air of relentless defiance.

Beautiful beyond comparison.

Her lungs embrace the toxic air.

Knowing this, she takes a breath.

Beautiful beyond comparison.

The experience of reality, to her, was a formality.

Engendered as the giant’s gift, she damned the waters and slowed our drift.

What can we learn from the remains of a goddess?

We must change the pattern before we become godless.

Interrupt this flux that connects the complexities.

Learn to uncover the secrets in subtleties.

Beautiful beyond comparison.

Her lungs embrace the toxic air.

Knowing this, she takes a breath, begging for her chemical rest.

A body, cold and constant, embraces the gift of a daughter

雨后 雾气 平地 湿漉粗糙 
路人 擦肩 挤迫 默然前行

无论广场或是公园 
熟悉的地方
陌生的面孔
正值青春 或步入暮年的人们
他她它 离或合 散与聚
无他------都为了让生命继续燃烧着

束缚无法限制生如夏花的思绪
若如云图般的意境无法被扼杀

我们由出生一刻到生命消逝一瞬
品尝浮生六味
却无法追忆甜美与苦楚之间的
一霎意念

忘掉 抑或是 留在那记忆清晰可见的片段
遗留的细节 已经无法再定义

(浮浮沉沉憾动难 空无尽是掠青云 难舍心净花鸟虫 独来往生苟同 残 悲却 无泪 喜却无嬉 哀却无言 怒发冲冠！难得难离 难舍弃 无色无味 无禁令 独善其身 空悲切 却之不恭 当幻影变成实相)

I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
This will not be the place for my tomb
Can you save my life?
There's no way
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
What can we do when we are lost
When we are lost
I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
Here the sun rise, the moon doesn't shine
I want to find the way
I can't die in this place
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
I'm lost
Take me back home
I will never come back to this place

,Lucy and me
,had a black history
,with poisoned thoughts
,and a bleeding misery
,We shared a street family
,and nobody let nobody down

,turned into a fight.

,A moment of a memory in your eyes
,Found and lost
,Some things we just can't despise
,Found and lost
,Scars and heartaches in our lives
,Found and lost
,Bad luck memories never die
,There was a time
,when we were far from reality
,Evil faces,
,never knowing who was the enemy
,That time has passed and gone
,and we're lucky to be alive
,and deep inside we know
,friendship never dies
,
,When the night is cold and the hours are long,
,I think about good times now long since gone,
,But no memory pleases me more to recall,
,Than the night that dear Willy came out on a crawl
,He was 18 for a few hours more,
,I fed him some whisky as he walked through my door
,The sounds of a house-party rolled down the street
,So we pounded our Pilsner and leapt to our feet.
,Oh he had his filling
,Tequila swilling
,Oh he put out the flames
,And it earned him the name
,Fire marshal Willy“
,
,Oh we led him away to the depths of the house
,With Jose Cuervo and old famous grouse
,He took 15 shots in the blink of an eye
,Fell under the porch by the bbq side
,And they told him just sit down instead
,Do touch that extinguisher shiny and red
,But William was drunk as I'd ere seen a man
,And so the insanity surely began
,Oh he had his filling
,Tequila swilling
,Oh he put out the flames
,And it earned him the name
,Fire marshal Willy“
,
,10 minutes later he flashed me a smile
,There wasn't combustion within 20 miles
,He'd hosed every chap in the whole fucking place
,And threw his cold water right in Justine's face
,When the night is cold and the hours are long,
,I think about good times now long since gone,
,But no memory gives me more pleasure then
,Than the night that dear Willy became a new man
,
,Oh he had his filling
,Tequila swilling
,Oh he put out the flames
,And it earned him the name
,Fire marshal Willy“
,Oh he had his filling
,Tequila swilling
,Oh he put out the flames

Life wasn't so grand, 
Until you threw a bone to me.
Life hasn't been bland, 
Since you lifted the phone for me < bone from me? >
I wasn't gonna stand
For those violent waves of the sea.
I was so reluctant to grab
The silent < waves of the heat? ways of your __? >
And mistakes I was making.

That's life!

Try doing to yourself, as you would do unto me
<(And I'm hardly listening)>
Supply screaming for the shelf
That hangs above your sink
<(And don't bother undressing?)>
Cries brewing on your health
Have gotten intoxicating
(Crashing into my knees)
Sties stewing on your stealth
Will rot your well-being
(Stopping well short of Beijing)

I'm trailing you the crumbs,
Of the currant white bread trapping.
I'm feeling every hump,
Of a wide tread tire marking.
I'm mailing in the hump,
To a wife's tired embarking
Save prayers for the dying,
And thoughts for the hemorrhaging.
And the atheists will sing,
That's life!

OK, it's time for Sayonara
So long yankee break my heart
Now there's nothing left but sorrow
Even the best friends they must part
I walked into the nearest bar
I sat and gazed across the sea
I wandered lonely on the beach
The waves just whispered misery
She had a red red scarf
Around her neck
Her eyes were green
Her hair was black
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu
(Som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)
I got new papers in a bordello
With some luckies and my I.D.
My heart was pounding like a hammer
Thai Thai Thai Thai Thai! I am free
She kissed me softly on the lips
She took my hand without a sound
This was our happy ever after
So motherfucker kiss the ground

,To court her and attain her
,I fear my heart's in danger
,From the Queen of all Argyll

I was thinking of home as the bus pulled away 
Take me to the 
Cape and you knowing what 
I had to do 
And the sun it beat down all along the highway 
As I thought about the day when 
I told you 
I would stay 
I was trying just to find the words to tell you 
That I had to go and leave it all behind 
I had to go back to the land where 
I had come from 
I'd lost what 
I came to find had to leave it all behind 
And the lights of old 
Boston still shine on you now 
Where you'll be what they want you to be 
Yeah the lights of old 
Boston still shine on you now 
And you know in your heart in your heart you must be free 
Goodbye my girl don't you know 
I hate to leave you 
Goodbye my girl and 
I hate to see you cry 
Goodbye my girl don't you know 
I hate to leave you 
But it's better this way to say goodbye 
You were smiling when you met me at the station 
And I wondered if you'd cry when 
I told you 
I would die 
If I had to stay one more week in this nation 
It's the land of the free but not where 
I want to be 
And you asked me if 
I loved you more than 
Ireland And to tell the truth the answer it was no 
Cause I just knew that 
I could never make this my land 
In the home of the brave 
I would only find a grave 
As I got aboard the plane my heart was breaking 
As I left you there in pain with no words that could explain 
Why I had to make to make the journey 
I was making 
Had to leave you alone but then how could you have known 
All the things 
I was feeling deep inside me 
As I sat there 
I wondered how 
I could love a country more than 
I could love you 
As the plane took off and flew 
I just knew that it was true

,Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
,I found your address and got your phone number too
,Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
,Been to secret places you think nobody knows
,If I had to live without you
,Nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I've been hanging 'round all the places you haunt
,Spying on your friends to find out what you want
,Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
,Follow you around driving home in your car
,Do I have to breathe without you?
,'Cause nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I know this must be wrong
,It can't go on
,This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
,And making me a mockery
,This must be wrong
,It can't go on
,So won't somebody free me from this misery?
,Bring my baby closer to me
,'Cause no one else can love you like I do
,You feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin'
,No one else can love you like I do
,I know you feel it when I'm creepin up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,'Cause no one else can love you, no no
,Like I do
,I know you feel me peeping in on you
,Watching everything you do
,'Cause no one else can love you, no
,Like I do
,No one else should love you, no
,Like I do
,Baby creepin' up on you
,Watching everything you do
,Yeah 'cause no one else can love you
,No no one else should touch you
,No one else can love you
,Touch you
,Love you
,Be with you

,You're awful bright, you're awful smart
,I must admit you broke my heart
,The awful truth is really sad
,I must admit, I was awful bad
,While lovers laugh and music plays
,I stumble by and I hide my pain
,Hmm, the lamps are lit, the moon is gone
,I think I crossed the Rubicon
,I, I walk the streets of love
,And they're full of tears
,And I, I walked the streets of love
,And they're full of fears
,While music pumps from passing cars
,A couple watched me from a bar
,A band just played the weddin' march
,And the corner-store mends broken hearts
,And a woman asks me for a dance
,Ohh, it's free of charge, just one more chance
,Oh, but I, I walk the streets of love
,And they're full of tears
,And I, I walk the streets of love
,Ya, for a thousand years
,Oh, tell me now
,And I, oh, I'll walk the streets of love
,Yeah and they're drenched with tears, oh

,Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
,The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
,Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
,Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
,The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
,Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
,But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
,Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
,Oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
,Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
,See she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
,Lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
,Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
,For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
,Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
,Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
,Standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
,Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
,And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
,Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
,Oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
,Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
,Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
,Lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alone
,My girl,my girl,don’t lie to me.
,Tell me where did U sleep last night.
,In the pines！in the pines！

,My girl,my girl,where will U go?
,I’m going where the cold wind blows.
,In the pines！in the pines！
,Where the sun don’t ever shine.

,Her husband,was hardworking man.
,Just about a mile from here.
,His head was found in a driving wheel.
,But his body never was found.

,There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town
,Starlight by the edge of the creek
,The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
,Money's gettin' shallow and weak
,Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory
,It's a new path that we trod
,They say low wages are a reality
,If we want to compete abroad
,My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
,Come sit down on my knee
,You are dearer to me than myself
,As you yourself can see
,While I'm listening to the steel rails hum
,Got both eyes tight shut
,Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
,Creeping it's way into my gut
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
,Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
,Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
,Tossed by the winds and the seas
,I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
,I'll sell 'em to their enemies
,I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
,Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
,Sometimes no one wants what we got
,Sometimes you can't give it away
,Now the place is ringed with countless foes
,Some of them may be deaf and dumb
,No man, no woman knows
,The hour that sorrow will come
,In the dark I hear the night birds call
,I can feel a lover's breath
,I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
,Sleep is like a temporary death
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes
,You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
,Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues

,Well, they burned my barn and they stole my horse
,I can't save a dime
,I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced

,How I wish you were here to see
,Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
,That you have forgotten me?
,Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
,They waste your nights and days
,Them I will forget
,But you I'll remember always
,Old memories of you to me have clung
,You've wounded me with your words
,Gonna have to straighten out your tongue

,Wanna look in my eyes, please do
,No one can ever claim
,That I took up arms against you
,All across the peaceful sacred fields
,They will lay you low
,They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
,I say it so it must be so
,Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
,Gonna give you another chance
,I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
,To lead me off in a cheerful dance
,I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
,I can live on rice and beans
,Some people never worked a day in their life
,Don't know what work even means
,Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
,Bring me my boots and shoes

,There's not much going on today.
,I'm really bored, it's getting late.
,What happened to my Saturday?
,Monday's coming, the day I hate.
,Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.
,He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
,He wouldn't even open up the door.
,He never made me feel like I was special.
,He isn't really what I'm looking for.
,This is where I start to bite my nails.
,And clean my room when all else fails.
,I think it's time for me to bail.
,This point of view is getting stale.
,Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.
,He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
,He wouldn't even open up the door.
,He never made me feel like I was special.
,He isn't really what I'm looking for.
,Na na na na na, we've all got choices.
,Na na na na, we've all got voices.
,Na na na na na, stand up make some noise.
,Na na na na, stand up make some noise.
,Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.
,He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
,He wouldn't even open up the door.
,He never made me feel like I was special.
,He isn't really what I'm looking for.
,He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
,He wouldn't even open up the door.
,He never made me feel like I was special.
,Like I was special, cuz I was special.
,Na na na na na.
,I don't give a damn about my reputation
,You're living in the past, it's a new generation
,A girl can do what she wants to do
,And that's what I'm gonna do
,And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,And I don't give a damn about my reputation
,I never said I wanted to improve my station
,And I'm only doing good when I'm having fun
,And I don't have to please no one
,And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

,I've never been afraid of any deviation
,And I don't really care if you think I'm strange
,I ain't gonna change
,And I'm never gonna care about my bad reputation
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,And I don't give a damn about my reputation
,The world's in trouble, there's no communication
,And everyone can say what they want to say
,It never gets better anyway
,So why should I care about a bad reputation
,Anyway
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,And I don't give a damn about my reputation
,You're living in the past, it's a new generation
,And I only feel good when I got no pain
,And that's how I'm gonna stay
,And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
,It's not me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
,Oh no (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)

,You were perfect
,I was unpredictable
,It was more than worth it
,But not too sensible
,Young and foolish
,That seem to be the way
,I was stupid
,To think that I could stay
,Oh oh

,On the last night on earth when the horses run free
,The scriptures foretell of a party in Hackney
,In a dimly lit room full with loathing and hate
,They're selling their souls and I just can't wait
,I shrivel inside at the sight of your beauty

,She said she,and then she, until I turned blue
,Oh , the things we get up to, to get through the night
,After you
,After you
,I knew it was wrong; I began to suspect
,When she reached over and pressed the eject
,I was up to the gunnels against all advice
,I felt so ashamed that I did it twice
,From disco to disco; from Safeway to Tesco
,We're shopping around from the cradle til death row
,From Tesco it's down to the 7-11
,To chase through the night time, to chase through the night
,After you
,After you
,I can't explain why I need to be free
,But if you need to be naked that's alright by me
,It's the fast track express to the graveyard, I know
,So what are you waiting for? Hey ho, let's go
,From disco to disco; from Safeway to Tesco

The tadpole buoyant as basalt
The seahorse horsing in assault
The owlet in his greenery
The narwhal in his cup of sea
They all believe
They all believe
But collusion bleeds through back allies
From parapets that end on feet
When one is weak they discreetly meet
They throw the bones into the street
And they progress
And we retreat
And all the books our fathers wrote
Are in the middle of the road
Little by little we implode
History brittle, brown and broke
We can't remember what was spoke
So we stare in wonder at the smoke
What it begets is born alone
We know not now what we have known!
Ladies, breathe deep against your whalebones
For your children come home made of stone
The terror seething sees a way
Or like the wheezing of the bay
In miniature agonies
They travel westward on the breeze
Bring us all to our knees
The dappled horse, the sorrowed mare
With eyes that do not see but stare
Beneath boots as black as Malachi
He drives a nag into the night
Into the night
And all the baby boys we've borne
With eyes averted from the storm
Sent off to die in perfect form
We know now what we have known!
Satellite photos, rhetoric
See how the euphemisms stick
And when they come back, broke and burned
Those who return have not returned!

I've gotta big big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on preakness
Never met a girl that likes to drink with horses
Knows her 
Chinese ballet
Must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze
A thing or two at night
Make me sick sick sick to kiss you and 
I think that 
I woud vomit
But I'll do that on mondays 
I don't have a work way
I like it when 
I bump you an accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lense
I'll hold you don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes 
I'm quiet. 
Hallelujah!
Sometimes 
I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, 
I know...Well 
I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares?
A trapeze is a bird cage even if it's empty and definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore
I've gotta big big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
Sometimes you're quiet, and sometimes 
I'm quiet, hallelujah
Sometimes 
I'm talkative, and sometimes you're not talkative, 
I know...Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me. 
Hallelujah!
Sometimes 
I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. 
Well, hello...
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you, would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feelin' in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Gotta crush, high
Thought I crushed all 
I couldCrushed all 
I can then 
I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop'
Cause stories of your brother make my crush high pop
And you couldn't really know, cause it's in my toes
And sometimes 
I wonder where that crush high go
Crush high then 
I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my dos and still feel ill

,曾经像火一样燃烧的意志
,不要让他熄灭在心中
,迎着一切向前冲
,不回头我不认输
,就当我的视线已经变的模糊
,这激动的泪水流动在我眼中
,迎着一切向前冲
,不回头我不认输
,就当我的视线已经看不清楚
,永远不会停住脚下的每一步

Daddy has told me when he was alive
That forgiveness is strength
And all That I want is to get rid of this hate which gnaws me
Accept my forgiveness and fall&nbsp;!
My bitterness devours my entrails, takes the entire place in me
Don't consider me as your enemy but sleep with an eye open
Cause the day will come and all my fondness will fall on you
I'll clasp you so much that I will be able to hear
The sound of your broken bones
A word from me will slide on you as a scalpel on your skin
You'll understand what my terror means
And my imploring glance will make you sick
Accept my forgiveness and fall
I look at myself and I probe my mind
What I can see destroys me everyday
Pledge of retaliation
The day will come and all my fondness will fall on you
I'll clasp you so much that I will be able to hear
The sound of your broken bones
I don't want any revenge just a return to the balance
The thing which helps me to live is to know you suffer
I'll stand stoical admiring your slow decline
Please, accept me to forget it all but never turn your back
All is behind now but I am sorry
Cause the unconscious work is not over

,Kill the weak, enslave the strong.

,The rape and purging of your flock.

,I've heard the word of God, He has abandoned you.
,Remove your flesh to start afresh and be reborn anew.

,Now you fucking crawl, give me what is mine.
,Heroes rise and fall, yet I'm carved into time.

From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead to
work for me
to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out
this failed race, fertile earth and water for the starved true
creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day
oppressive rule returns to transcend the weak foundations of man,
awakening the undead, immortal servants risen only to eliminate,
sinking rotting teeth, screams of the frail as they get devoured
carrion corpses running wild, there is no salvation
grinding of internal organs creates a pleasurable sound
From the bowels of the earth they will arise, I summon your dead, to
work for me
to raise an army unlike one's ever seen, ancestral beings wipe out
this failed race, fertile earth and water for the starved true
creators, once extinguished but brought forth to kill another day
torn apart by the mutated deceased, ripping you apart as your stumps
bleed eternally
I live on even as your flesh deteriorates, spreading myself among the
oblivious populous, infecting everything around with my viral antigene

To conformists to be destroyed. From the top of a wasteland I bow to no man
so when the shadow of evil set in you must pray for damnation. And I will
watch you bow your head in shame and i will set this world a flame. For through
the blood of the innocent I now know your name. Before you doubt i could be one
of your friends with the best of intentions for me. And i now i know you cant
adore the pain anymore the world has left you behind. With the fading sun you
shall follow the path of deception.running through the streets and storms your
at the feet of infection. Your not a martyr your just a follower if you can
promise to be destroyed. From the top of a wasteland I bow to no man so when
the shadow of evil set in you will scream for damnation. And I will watch you
all your dead insane and i will set this world aflame. For through the blood of
the innocent I now know your name.you all your dead insane and i will set this
world aflame. For through the blood of the innocent I now know your name. your
here in restraint so tell me are you are a martyr ill challenge every word of
your faith. And watch your kingdom slip under and under and father away. your
not a martyr your just a follower and your whole point is to be destroyed. oh
no I bow to no man who the fuck you to say that's treason oh no I bow to no man so fuck you what the fuck do you believe in.

  What you pray for
 A maimed savior
 Bathed in rancor to punish their behavior
 Your institution of persecution
 One solution to start from a clean slate
 
 He doesn't say that he will save us
 Behind a serrated grin
 He fails to hide his serrated grin
 Nominie dei nostri satanas luciferi exelci 
 
 （The uploader ：Skullor） 

Digging through trenches still
but our work is not done yet.
Forcing ourselves 
through all who oppose.
We are not afraid to get our hands dirty,
not afraid because we were always filthy.
Knee deep in what we love,
but our work is not done yet.
We've got a job to do.
Never turn your back on us
We stand tall, we stand firm
Now it's time to hit them where it hurts.
Walk towards us
and stand in our shadow.
Walk towards us
and be the ones that follow.
We've gotten our hands dirty
and we wont stop now.
To think that we would stop
you must have lost
your fucking mind.
We are continuous,
We are never ending.
We'll give you something to believe in
let us be your breath of fresh air.
Now breathe us in.
We are bringing life into something stagnant.
You lost your fucking mind.
We will stand aside,
one by one
watch you die.

Doesn't make any sense to you 
When I do everything you tell me not to do 
When you turn the corner you built for me 
You can bet it's way too good to be true 
So you say, you can see through the cracks of my pain 
There's a satellite image like a map of my brain, my brain 
Too many voices telling the ones that need to be 
I, I must turn it down, turn it down 
Turn it down, turn it down 
Everyone's gonna get their chance 
So there's no need to feel lost 
Storm the crowd, turn me off, turn me off 
Turn me off, turn me off 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
If that's all you really wanted to be 
Better brace yourself for the hurricane we deliver 
Best prepare for the winter 
We can wake up at , beat the fury in our heads 
We'll be running downstream while you're swimming up river 
It'll make you shiver 
Too many voices telling the ones that need to be 
I, I must turn it down, turn it down 
Turn it down, turn it down 
Everyone's gonna get their chance 
So there's no need to feel lost 
Storm the crowd, turn me off, turn me off 
Turn me off, turn me off 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
You pray I'll stay in the sun 
But that's not what I'm made of 
That's not what I'm made of 
Now you say, I'm not sweet enough to talk 
But I still got sugar, I still got sugar 
I still got sugar, I still got sugar 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
You best be believing, best be believing 
Best be believing, best be believing 
Nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah 
Best be, best be believing

You used to laugh at my jokes when I told them
Now you just roll your eyes and say I don`t know you
You used to look at me with sweet emotion
Now you`re crying
Girlfriend
We used to be the shit
Somehow I`ve lost that girl of mine
And we just cant remember
How we used to be
The two of us were once naive
Thinking this could last forever
Now we barely speak
Haven`t said a word all week
Our love was warm Like a VHS tape of Aladdin
Now our loves so cold
Plays the disk of Cruel Intentions
We used to be the shit
We used to be the shit
La la la la la la
We used to be the shit
Girlfriend
We used to be la...
We used to be free
Now she`s just used to me

Now you`re crying

Eternal life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel
Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son
Crown my fear, you're king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is to love everyone
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal
Yeah oh no
There's no time for hatred, only questions
Where is love, where is happiness, what is life, where is peace?
When will I find the strength to bring me release?
Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye
To life eternal angel, yeah, angel, angel, you're angel

,While you are wasting your time on your enemies
,Engulfed in a fever of spite
,Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
,Like shadows into the night

,
,Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
,Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
,Stuck in a world of isolation
,While the ivy grows over the door
,So I open my door to my enemies
,And I ask could we wipe the slate clean

, Title: A Feast Of Friends
, Wow, I'm sick of doubt.
, Live in the light of certain.
, South.
, Cruel bindings.
, The servants have the power.
, Dog men and their mean women pulling poor blankets over our sailors.
, I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the T.V. tower.
, I want roses in my garden bower, dig?
, Royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud.
, These mutants, blood-meal for the plant that's plowed.
, They are waiting to take us into the severed garden.
, Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death on a strange hour?
, Unannounced, unplanned for,
, like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed.
, Death makes angels of us all and gives us wings where we had shoulders
, smooth as raven's claws.
, No more money, no more fancy dress,
, this other kingdom seems by far the best,
, until it's other jaw reveals incest,
, and loose obedience to a vegetable law.
, I will not go.
, Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family.
, M.V.A.

, I'll keep them still
,Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
,To chase a feather in the wind
,Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
,There moves a thread that has no end
,For many hours and days that pass ever soon
,The tides have caused the flame to dim
,At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom

,Fight to claim them for their own
,Where do bad folks go when they die
,They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
,They go down to the lake of fire and fry

,Viaton on hymysi, vaikka liassa on käsi
,Häpeätkö ollenkaan noita tekemisiäsi?
,Tuskin kukaan sinua jäisi ikävöimään
,Jos vankilasi avaimen heitän menemään
,Milloinkaan ei saavu aamu
,Tahratonko sielusi, vaikka ryvettyisit
,Ei enää ketään kenelle valheitasi myisit
,Ovat sanelemat pirun ja röyhkeytesi työt
,Olkoon laitimmainen kerta kun pöydässäni syöt
,Pirunkieli(x4)
,Pirunkieli - Todenpieli(x3)
,Pirunkieli - Pirunkieli
,Lammasmainen hymysi, mutta veressä kätesi
,Tajuatko ollenkaan, että mikä sinuun pesi
,Hapantukoon kuseksi vuosikertaviini
,Ja odottakoon sinua tylsä giljotiini
,Miten saisit asettumaan tuon pelonhorkan
,Entä miten katseilta piiloon pukinsorkan
,Ovat sanelemat pirun ja ahneutesi yöt
,Nyt et lepoa saa päivin ja valvot kaiket yöt

,Every step I take is another mistake to you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do
,Is be more like me and be less like you
,Can't you see that you're smothering me
,Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
,Cause everything that you thought I would be
,Has fallen apart right in front of you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,Every step that I take is another mistake to you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,And every second I waste is more than I can take
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do

,Roses are red in her red-gold hair.
,And O where her bosom and girdle meet. Red roses are hidden there.
,Red roses are hidden there.
,Red roses are hidden there.
,Fair is the knight who lies slain. Amid the rush and reed.
,See the lean fishes that are fain.Upon dead men to feed.
,Sweet is the page that lies there,
,Cloth of gold is goodly prey.
,See the black ravens in the air. Black, Oh black as the night are they.
,What do they there so stark and dead?
,There is blood upon his hand.
,Why are the lilies flecked with red?
,There is blood on the river sand.
,There is blood on the river sand.
,There are two that ride from the south and east,
,And two from the north and west,
,For the black raven a goodly feast,
,For the King’s daughter rest.
,There is one man who loves her true.
,Red, Oh red, is the stain of gore!
,He dug a grave by the darksome yew.
,One grave will do for four.
,
,No moon in the still heaven.
,In the black water none.
,The sins on her soul are seven.
,The sin upon his is one.
,One.
,One.
,Upon his is one.
,One.
,One.
,Upon his is one.
,One.
,Upon his is one.

,Are your eyes just singing the blues?
,Dirty records from another time
,Some blood stains on your shoes
,No one really knows about your soul
,And I barely even know your name
,Burning rhythms and posting lies
,And for a bunch of fools drown in shame
,Amy dont you go
,I want you around
,Singin woah please dont go
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
,Did you tattoo a lucky charm
,To keep you out of harms way?
,Warding off all evil signs
,But it never really kept you safe
,Now youre too young for the golden age
,Cause the record bins been replaced
,27 gone without a trace
,And you walked away from your drink
,Amy dont you go
,I want you around
,Singin woah please dont go
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
,Amy please dont go!

,Is your heart singing out of tune
,Are you eyes just singing the blues?
,Dirty records from another time
,Some blood stains on your shoes
,May I have this last dance
,By chance if we should meet?
,Can you write me a lullaby?
,So we can sing you to sleep
,Amy dont you go
,I want you around
,Singin woah please dont go
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
,Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

,Lady, where has your love gone?
,I was looking but can't find it anywhere
,They always offer when there's loads of love around
,But, when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
,Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
,No chance, you'll get nothin' from me
,But now she's there, you're there, everybody's there (Ain't that fuckin' fair?)
,He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
,Just like me
,Let's go down, down, low down
,Where I know I should not go
,Oh, and she thinks she's the one
,But she's just one in 24
,And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
,Does that mean that I can, too?
,Lady, where has your love gone?
,It was the antiseptic to the sore
,To hold you by the hand
,Must you first be in demand
,How he longs for you to long for him once more
,Just once more
,Let's go down, down, low down
,Where I know I should not go
,Oh and she thinks she's the one
,But she's just one in 24
,And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
,Does that mean that I can, too? Oh
,Her eyes went down and cut you up
,And there's nothing like a dirty look from
,The one you want or the one you've lost
,An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
,To get what they can't have
,That's why you're after her
,And that's why she's after him
,But sayin' it won't change a thing
,You know, realising it won't change a thing
,Realising it won't change a thing
,
,When you try your best but you don't succeed
,When you get what you want but not what you need
,When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
,Stuck in reverse
,When the tears come streaming down your face
,When you lose something you can't replace
,When you love someone but it goes to waste
,Could it be worse?
,Lights will guide you home
,And ignite your bones
,And I will try to fix you
,And high up above or down below
,When you're too in love to let it go
,But if you never try you'll never know
,Just what you're worth
,Lights will guide you home
,And ignite your bones
,And I will try to fix you
,Tears stream down your face
,When you lose something you cannot replace
,Tears stream down your face
,And I
,Tears stream down your face
,I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
,Tears stream down your face
,And I
,Lights will guide you home
,And ignite your bones
,And I will try to fix you

,oh they say people come, they say people go.
,This particular diamond was extra special
,And though you might be gone
,And the world may not know
,Still I see you, celestial
,Like a lion you ran
,A Goddess you rolled
,Like an eagle you circled
,In perfect purple
,So how come things move on?
,How come cars don’t slow?
,When it feels like the end of my world?
,When I should but I can’t let you go?
,But when I’m cold, cold
,Oh when I’m cold, cold
,There’s a light that you give me
,When I’m in shadows
,There’s a feeling you give me, an everglow
,Like brothers in blood
,Sisters who ride
,And we swore on that night
,We'd be friends 'til we died
,But the changing of winds
,And the way waters flow
,Life as short as the falling of snow
,And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
,But when I'm cold, cold
,In water rolled, salt
,I know that you’re with me
,And the way you will show
,And you’re with me wherever I go
,And you give me this feeling this everglow
,Oh, what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
,Yeah, I live for this feeling this everglow
,So if you love someone, you should let them know
,Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
,It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
,I'm not one of those who can easily hide
,I don't have much money but boy if I did
,I'd buy a big house where we both could live
,If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
,Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
,I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
,My gift is my song and this one's for you
,And you can tell everybody this is your song
,It may be quite simple but now that it's done
,I hope you don't mind
,I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
,How wonderful life is while you're in the world
,I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
,Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
,But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
,It's for people like you that keep it turned on
,So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
,You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
,Anyway the thing is what I really mean
,Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
,And you can tell everybody this is your song
,It may be quite simple but now that it's done
,I hope you don't mind
,I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
,How wonderful life is while you're in the world
,I hope you don't mind
,I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
,How wonderful life is while you're in the world

,a part of me died when I let you go
,I would fall asleep
,only in hopes of dreaming
,that everything would be like is was before
,but nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting
,they disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
,after all this time

The prophecies have come full circle on this day and we will die.
The scriptures tell of fire, covering the world. Mankind shall scream simultaneously.
As the pain courses through the nerves. Sending fucking countless souls to hell.
And now the devil has enslaved an army to overrun heaven itself.
The saints and angels will never stand a chance as the mortal souls storm this pearly gates.
God stands ready on his throne but the hoard is overpowering, now they send his fucking corpse to the ruined earth.
All hope dies with him too. Light shall die as well.
Now earth stands lifeless and desolate and dark. Satan sets his course for other worlds.
To reign an empire upon the unknown. His army swells as each world is obliterated
And no being can oppose him for his power is infinite. Flame is the only element now.
All will burn forever.
The stars fall from their rightful place. Creating a million suns. The remnants of the planets fuse together.
To become one. We were all deceived. Satan has become God. Memories are wiped from the souls of the dead.
To begin earth again and this shall happen once every one million years. The ancients will predict the end once again.
An endless repeat for eternity and the next devil will overthrow the current king.
Humanity has no say in this. This is what must be done. To insure direction and maintain the balance between the light and the dark. This is the endless prophecy forever we will fear the wrath of the gods.
Evil will prevail.

In this land of dissolving fiends 
I am Godfather Death 
By prostration 
And in this land of callous deeds, 
Here I reign 
Here I reign... 
Conquered by venom, you're the evil that's within him 
And my bidding is the truth, you are the lie 
Sent by the father to demand the mother's daughter 
Bring her to me, for she is mine! 
Enter 
The very darkness that made you blind 
I am your mentor 
But you've betrayed me for the last time 
Decide 
Your fate is nothing predetermined 
I am beside 
Every bed lit by the devil's flame 
I am 
Watching your every move 
You can't hide from death 
Look in the mirror 
Do you see yourself or me? 
And when your candles burn to none 
Just know your journey's just begun 
And then you'll see what you have done 
Fuck with death and you are gone 
Death, no longer 
Gods, I'm stronger

Live to murder and murder to live
Nothing left of the path of innocence
We are all corrupt at the core
We are all deaf to slaughter
There is no chance of brightness
There is no chance of light
Give up, you're wasting away
There is no hope left to live for
Give up, your greed has bloated
This is the end, and you know it.
Reaper, arise
Cleanse this earth of filth
Rise from the pits of Hell
Like sheep, we follow blindly
Like swine, we consume all
The fault of the human condition
The fault that taints us all

To neglect & to fuck
Rather than to protect & to serve
Protectors of the public, like fuck
What a joke authorities have become
Servants to the corporations & the government
A grievance to your fellow man
Oh, little piggy
What's that little piggy?
"Oink, oink"
Would you like some bacon to go with your arrogance?
Beating skin & cracking bone as a profit to the rich
I bet you think you're something special
While you're cracking skulls but your instrument of sick agendas
Burn your badge & join your brothers
Your job role is as a professional cunt
So do humanity a favor & join as we protest
Maiming & raping & pillaging & fucking manufactured devastation
Don't be so pompous, causing a raucous for mass enslavement
Oh, little piggy
Did you really think you lent hand, little piggy
Delusional in your authority
The truth: you're nothing but a pawn
Arresting for profit
An expert extortionist, funneling the money from pockets of the public to the palms of the corrupt
Detaining for profit
Did your know you take orders from a banker cartel?
From a bunch of fucking scum
You don't have to say anything
Anything you do, say will be given in evidence
"Oink, oink"
Fuck your authority
Using powers to enslave, intimidate, extort & falsely accuse
Threaten, assault & murder
Inherently evil acts by evil people
Relinquish respect for these fuckers
Looking down on the public
From a pedestal build of exploitation
Do you even remember the last time they protected & served you?
No, the police neglect & then fuck you over
Our point is made ,
Send them to the slaughterhouse

,DON'T DARE TOUCH THAT DIAL!
,So, you've fulfilled lies saturated on your lifeless corpse.
,A wad of worthless money tightly clutched in one hand.
,And in the glow of my pixelated stare, you see this program's drawing to an end.
,And I've dissected synapses and shed your dreams, they've been precisely extracted from your head.
,And you lapped up your decomposed intellect.
,Everything will be OK, I'll just sit down and watch some bullshit.
And I will continue to move forward
Crushing everything
Diamond crusher and I am the hammer
You're worthless, not me
Living a life that only I can see
You're worthless, to me
Singing back to a song that you will never be
The time is now to prove your worth
Show the world, the world for what it was
If you're reckless, and free
Speak up, sing this with me, with me, with me

What do you hope to prove? Other than the fact your species deserves a permanent fucking extinction.
Unlike other life forms, humans are worthless.
Make way for my offspring of darkness.
This onslaught was pure amusement, a senseless massacre.
Not a single thing more, for the seekers of peace will only find it in death. ,
I do not need assistance to rule this world, everything will grovel at my feet.
The only thing I find valuable about your species, is the noises you make when you die.
This onslaught was pure amusement, a senseless massacre.
Not a single thing more, for the seekers of peace will only find it in death. ,
Simple minded shit and piss filled sacks of meat and blood.
Not designed for rebellion, but the perfect specimen to experience pain.
What do you hope to prove? Other than the fact your species deserves a permanent fucking extinction.
Unlike other life forms, humans are worthless.
Make way for my offspring of darkness.
I will create a kingdom in my image.
But to rebuild, one must first destroy.
Your destruction will be instantaneous.
Mindless psyche, controlled and channeled through a series of religious tactics.
Futile humans. Delicate, empty, vessels of emotion.

A treaty between alpha and omega beings 
Summoning a darkened era upon earth
Ancients receive immortality
The rest shall be servants of the gods
Slow-poisoning xenobiotic substances will enslave your sick
A pact of horrifying consequence
A new alteration
Humanoid mutation of alien seed
The agenda implemented through genetic infiltration
Sinister
Undignified
A treaty between alpha and omega beings 
Summoning a darkened era upon earth
Promising unearthly intellect
Feeding on the selfishness of man
Forever 
The ancient covenant is sealed with the blood of unsewn loins
The ancient covenant is sealed with the blood of unsewn tainted loins
Begin integration of the hybrid population
Ancients join the ranks of the gods for their curses of destined generations

How long do you have to live a lie before you've convinced everyone that it's true? 
Realize that what everyone sees in you was nothing more than a wall stacked ten stories. 
Just like a myth, a fable, you were talked up from ear to ear. 
Each line embellished over time. 
The man you are is not the man you were meant to be. 
A coward. 
A fake. 
Keep pretending; soon enough things will crumble to the ground. 
You're the king of a world you built for yourself, but nothing more than a fraud in reality. 
Built on a mirage; Idolized by the masses. 
If they could only see the truth they would coil in disgust. 
How much longer until the pressure makes you break? 
You have been exposed as the monster that you are; a prophet that deserves no praise. 

Cheers to the past（干杯，往事）
 
曾经走过青春的路一起肩并着肩不低头
即使在分岔的路口勇敢向前走
经常回忆那些聚在一起躁动的时候
找着无数的借口 谈论着理想自由
干杯 所有往事 别让青春不知不觉消失
干杯 所有往事 永远记得说的那个坚持
干杯 所有往事 别让青春不知不觉消失
干杯 所有往事 别忘记 那些走过的路
所有往事 别再消失
Cheers！

So we can try to be good
What can i do I feel it better
The last have to leave 
We can’t just wait for a miracle

No matter what they say
We never give over
No matter what they say
We go Oh We will go

We can go Try to be a better guy
Shall we go This is a crazy night
Dancing girl Try to smile one more time
We’ll say it’s never... the last night

,静 静 的 远离
,
,我找到我的方向 我回到我的地方
,我睡在破巴士上 等待今天的夕阳
,我走了千万里路 我踏遍所有泥土
,我穿着破烂衣服 一切都觉得幸福
,如果我悄悄的没有了呼吸
,有谁感受到我的离去
,舍不得无声无息的闭上了眼睛
,你 是否会记得我的姓名
,当我已被这世界放弃
,静 静 的 远离
,今夜就让我盖上满天的星光
,怀抱着自己拥有的岛屿和海洋

,也曾伤害过对方 也曾像孩子一样
,电话聊到天亮 走过了这几年的路
,总是在争论着谁对谁错 到头来没有意思的结果
,两个人心里都非常难过 一整夜挣扎着受尽折磨
,虽然我说但我却舍不得
,是什么让我们变的脆弱
,我用力跑向你 但你却要离开我
,为什么不明白 你为什么不明白我
,是我让你哭了 是你在最需要我的时候
,你却又原谅了 抬不起头看你的我
,我知道在此刻 什么话都不必再说
,不追究谁欠谁更多 相信只要还是你和我
,不在想知道是谁对谁错 管那些没有意义的结果
,不想让对方再一次的难过 我不要一整夜再受折磨
,虽然我说但我却舍不得
,是什么让我们变的脆弱
,我用力跑向你 你也用力跑向我
,相信你会明白我 这世界只有你明白我
,感谢上天让你认识了我
,不知我能给你带来什么
,感谢你从不会怀疑过我
,你让我不会再感到寂寞
,虽然我说但我却舍不得

,Sunlight was the only thing that

,But inside it feels like it keeps raining
,And every drop is like the tears we couldn't cry
,Because outside we were all alone
,But this place gave us something
,that somehow made us strong
,If there's a place inside this world
,Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost
,We'll stand as one against these walls
,And fight this fight forevermore
,Sometimes I feel this anger
,changing slowly in to
,A monster that keeps on creeping under
,And I don't think I can take anymore

Sinking under the water
Holding all your breath inside
Fighting to find all the answers
But frozen hearts can be kryptonite
You've gone down a path that you just can't go
The wrong way down a one way road
And I'm here to let you know
No, I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up on you
I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
Staring at your reflection
All you see is your broken smile
I hear somewhere in the distance
A warning sign
Can bring you back to life
You're on, on a path that you just can't go
The wrong way down a one way road
And I'm here to let you know
No, I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up on you
I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
No, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you fall
I'll never give up on you
No, I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up on you
I'll never let you go
No, I'll never let you fall
No, I'll never give up on you
(I'm here to let you...)
Know I'll never let you go (go)
I'll never let you fall (go)
I'll never give up on you
(I'm here to let you...)
Know I'll never let you go (go)
I'll never let you fall (go)
I'll never give up on you
I'll never give up on you

You think you know me*
Got me figured out
Your casting shadows
Casting doubt
You think you know me
You think I care
You should spend some time sometime with the person in the mirror
I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
You don't know me
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
I'm a tooth on the cog that you built to spill
You don't know me
I'm not defined by what you think I am
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
All like diamonds without the shine
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find
I'm a crow, I'm the most with the least to gain
I'm a fading Mona Lisa in a plywood frame
You don't know me
I'm a ring on a tree in a life that fell
What I did I done good and what I done I did well
You don't know me
Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
Drawing borders
Lines on a map we don't need
I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
You don't know me
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
I'm the time that got away
It's already gone
You don't know me

,
I wanna live, I wanna be aware!
I wanna live, I wanna be awake!
Without the words you say,
stuck inside me head.
I'll spell it out for you once again!
This is a war you will never win!
You can't take me, you can't break me,
you can't take me down.
Hear what you want, say what you will!
Live in your sick sad little world!
You think you know it all, you think you know me,
you don't know a thing.
Consumed by their lies too many time,
your eyes and ears are now useless.
So don't bother speaking a word,
Because I know that you'll poison the truth!
I wanna live, I wanna be aware!
I wanna live, I wanna be awake!
Without the words you say,
stuck inside me head.
What's this life without consequence?
What's it worth if I can't believe?
We can make it out alive, 
as long as we just try to survive.
I used to be just like you,
I used to think i knew just where i stood,
but I was wrong, yeah, I was wrong.
I used to be just like you,
lost inside without a clue.
So hear me now.
This life is not a race!
You'll find your own escape!
We are all the same,
we're all born with flaws, 
we live to change. 
We are all the same,
so think before you hate!
I wanna live, I wanna be aware!
I wanna live, I wanna be awake!
Without the words you say,
stuck inside me head.
What's this life without consequence?
What's it worth if I can't believe?
We can make it out alive, 
as long as we just try to survive.
I'll survive!
I'll survive!
I wanna live, I wanna be aware!
I wanna live, I wanna be awake!
Without the words you say,
stuck inside me head.
What's this life without consequence?
What's it worth if I can't believe?
We can make it out alive, 
as long as we just try,
as long as we just try.
