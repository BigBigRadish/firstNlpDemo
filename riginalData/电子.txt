我想让世人知道中国风电音不仅有柔情细腻的山水歌，还有气势磅礴的史诗战争。这首歌描述的是战国时期烽火燎原的情景，歌颂的是袍泽义气，侠骨柔肠。
一支穿云箭，千军万马来相见。
这首歌用到的民族乐器不仅仅是二胡，还有巴乌和葫芦丝，结合西方乐器的小提琴/大提琴以及合成器的Big Room/Trap

, Holding on to the fortress
, Broken down in between the walls
, Looking up, looking up
, Fires in the sky but the sun's not shining
, I hear the sound in the distance
, Feel the quake as my castle falls
, It's not enough, not enough
, I'm praying to a lie, now there's nowhere to hide
,
, This house wasn't built for love
, No I could tell you'd hit me over and over
, With waves from your agitated mind
, I'll stand tall while you rip me up
, I know that it won't bring you closure
, Come closer and see what you made of me
,
, I'll stand tall while you rip me up
, I know that it won't bring you closure
, Come closer and see what you made of me
,
, Buried deep in a mindset
, Reaching out with your open arms
, I fell in love, fell in love
, You were showing me the light but you left me blinded
, I was a lone marionette
, Just a toy under your control
, When you were done, you were done
, You threw me to the side and you left me behind
,
, This house wasn't built for love
, No I could tell you'd hit me over and over
, With waves from your agitated mind
, I'll stand tall while you rip me up
, I know that it won't bring you closure
, Come closer and see what you made of me
,
, Won't bring you closure now
,
, I'll stand tall while you rip me up
, I know that it won't bring you closure
, Come closer and see what you made of me
,
,
,I see the fear in your eyes
,Can't find the feeling inside
,You can run, you can try, living on your own
,But I just can't let you go
,
,And I think that you might have been
,In my heart all along
,And I know that if this is real
,Then how could it be wrong?
,
,Wanna make you my only
,Let me heal you what's broken
,Let your hair down softly
,In a bed of roses
,You don't have to be lonely
,Let me heal you what's broken
,Just lay your head on me
,In a bed of roses
,
,I'll be the fire inside
,The one who's making you wild
,And I know you're afraid in a neverlast
,Cause it happens so fast
,
,And I think that you might have been
,In my heart all along

,Feel the waves over my head
,I'm in too deep
,I'm fading fast, but running right back
,Can't you see
,
,That it's all my heart can take
,Broke from my mistakes
,Scared that it's too late
,So please
,
,Don't say it's the end of the story
,Don't say it's the end of the road
,Cause as long as you're there to hold me

,Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
,There you go wishing floating down our wishing well
,It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
,I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
,We're gonna sweep this under the carpet
,I hope that I can turn back the time
,To make it all alright, all alright for us
,I'll promise to build a new world for us two
,With you in the middle
,Lying down beside you what's going through your head?
,The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
,Am I just overthinking feelings I can't say
,This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
,I hope we find our missing pieces, I'm just sure
,We're gonna sweep it under the carpet

,Whatever you wanna call it
You know this better than 
I can explain 
I lived it 
Was lost and now 
I’m moving on 
You wake up 
Realize the dream 
I feel that our luck is now coming on 
See the stars align 
And you know it’s all for you 
Down were you before 
Now you come alive for this 
There’s calm inside the storm 
If you know just what you’re trying for 
See what you could be 
And you know you shine for me 
Why not now 
Remember how we saw it to be 
I still see it 
Still time enough for me 
I see it shining 
Can almost touch it 
You can taste it in the air

,I was checking this girl next door
,When her parents went out
,She phoned said, "Hey, boy, come on right around."
,So I knock at the door
,You was standing with a bottle of red wine
,Ready to pour
,Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
,So I went in
,Then we sat down start kissing
,Caressing
,Told me about Jacuzzi
,Sounded interesting
,So we jumped right in
,All calls diverted to answer phone
,Please leave a message after the tone
,You know me and her
,Her parents were kinda cool
,But they ran a fine line between me and you
,We were just doing things young people in love do
,Parents trying to find out what we were up to
,Saying why were you creeping around late last night?
,Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
,Now you're dressed in black
,When I left you were dressed in white
,Can you fill me in?
,Calls diverted to answer phone
,Red wine bottle half the contents gone
,When I returned Jacuzzi's turned on
,Can you fill me in?
,Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
,I'd say, "Hey, girl, come on right around."
,So she knocked at the door
,I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
,Jumped in my ride
,Checkin' in where nobody saw
,The club we went in
,We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
,Saw it was early morning
,Thought we'd better be leaving
,So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
,Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
,I mean me and her
,Didn't mean to break the rules
,I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
,We were just doing things young people in love do
,Parents trying to find out what we were up to
,Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
,Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
,Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
,Can you fill me in?
,Wearing a jacket who's property
,Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
,But you left all your money on the TV
,Can you fill me in?
,(Can you fill me in?)
,Saying why were you creeping around late last night?
,Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
,Now you're dressed in black

这是一个回到盛唐的梦，我们把梦里的一切，都放在歌里，写进词里了。
笛子演奏：Fafar
 盛唐游记
泛舟云海，孤萧骤起。渭川既毕，物换星移。忽有佳人舞剑器，江清海凝。又见伯高走龙蛇，脱帽露顶。霓裳羽衣，三郎赠我。天王送子，道人泼墨。若喜嘉陵风光，可等建景数月。偏爱敦煌飞天，结伴玄奘辞别。荔枝不腆，望得妃子笑容。蜀道实难，不见太白仙踪。草庐梦，寒士欢颜。盛唐游，舞狮偿愿。

喜欢他们一直聊天的样子
每个人都喜欢这惟妙的声音
但是从未有人听到我在哭泣，放声痛哭
是你让它感觉像家一样
是你让它感觉像家一样
像家一样温暖
像家一样温馨
像家一样温存
从未如此害怕失去
但也永远无法理解平静
让我回到你的怀抱吧
因为是你让它感觉像家一样
因为是你让它感觉
像家一样
像家一样
只有你只有你才做得到
只有你只有你才做得到
这也不是同一个原因

,只有你 Even My Days Turning Grey
,Everybody Went Away Yeah
,你让我渐渐学会
,飞越All My Darkness Day
,You Know我们仍在顽抗着
,手刃导致中国音乐堕落的Loser
,你一直在Together

,JonyJ:
,你总是盘旋在我脑海里面
,想跟你缠绵一直到路灯熄灭
,你在我身边说可以放弃体面
,我装没听见还越来越没底线
,这几年像个失了控的小野兽
,玩的快要着魔
,游走在肉欲的丛林中
,可是内心一直漂泊
,身边总是留个空但是从不缺
,对我来说都是风景
,如果不是因为我写的歌选的路
,他们肯定早就不见踪影
,我知道物欲中酷与疯要怎么选择
,我知道恋爱中的很多人的忠诚都是演的
,我承认我害怕疼才把头用力点着
,反正我已经在这条路上走了这么远了
,太多情的便利店
,门开着没法藏
,我知道也许有一天我也会为了谁打烊
,但不是现在我像是掉拍没卡上
,我盼着那天可以早点来却总是鬼打墙
,你总是盘旋在我脑海里面
,想跟你缠绵一直到路灯熄灭
,你在我身边说可以放弃体面
,我装没听见还越来越没底线

,每到夜晚我都会想起那个灯火糜烂的地方
,已经熟悉那里的味道 弥漫青春的芬芳
,很多人在那里受过的伤 熬着自己的心灵鸡汤
,哭着在路边吐过 睡过也不觉得脏
,那时候的人们口中都没有谈论着爱情
,好像每一天阳光升起生活一切都可以归零
,街上的男孩眼神中没有一点的和平
,坐在可可清吧吃着旺角清粥的糯米鸡
,在浮游排队
,在苏荷策妹
,在城市英雄赛车队
,口里又说着谁谁谁玩消费联系哪个妹
,自己哥们AAA晚上订雅座一起来买醉
,这些套路技巧不用你学你看着玩着就能悟的会
,哥们玩得是气派桌上的酒摆的多
,也不用你啰嗦 姐妹们来一桌

,又有好多太放不下那里的感情搞得自噶垮屋
,现在那里马路已经变得宽敞
,魅力MUSE比哪个最闪

,身体开始提醒你恰多哒会不舒服
,未成年开始喊你渣渣吹扎壶
,曾经 你们哪个服
,现在再也不是一咋电话朋友们哈会出来
,每个人忙哒赚钱 在毛闲情克浮游算杂塔罗牌

,等到万事俱备之后你再去摊牌
,有时我也不懂是好是坏 （都别急）
,拿什么定义成功失败（数学题）
,那些该是你的 你不找它 它会过来找你
,不管输赢 都保持这个姿态 slow
,（有人来拍照 要记住插袋）

,我的瓶颈期就把它当作缓冲
,一切都在我手里自己掌控
,面对迎面来的麻烦我有我的脚步晃动
,当你开始失去你的节奏
,跟你对手决斗你的拳头绝对会变得特别慢
,有时候你进度快的崩溃
,结果发现事半功倍已经打包好的所有计划
,最后还得换
,想要淡淡定定但是战战兢兢
,没法玩的尽兴 你盼着幸运 能在你身边降临 yeah

,坚持用力扛起肩上的重担
,夜里灵感在陪伴 像指路的风帆
,尝过失败但别怕  会陪你再起东山
,我说过不会离开因为还没毕露锋芒
,坚挺的胸膛一直以来是前进的证据
,也许你匆忙离开已经不再渴望胜利
,想做到收支平衡 现实却不成正比
,尊重你的每个决定 我不再刨根问底
,谁愿陪我风雨同舟对抗挫败
,揣着梦想不放 乘风破浪漂洋过海
,活在风口浪尖像刀口般的生活
,做着别人不敢做的美国梦生活在中国
,不回头的走  哪怕前方敌众我寡
,在街头摸爬滚打 才是我要的活法
,不在乎百分百付出有几分获得
,像未完待续的使命必定以身作则

,现实给的巴掌有时候突如其来很痛
,只能强迫自己收起怒火 变得更稳重
,习惯逆境中生存 我必须赚钱养梦
,不想活得不自己生活被物质掌控
,在聚光灯下聆听着音箱里的返送
,感觉整个世界只有这里能留下感动
,要的不止一场梦所以比别人更拼
,失去过的不在乎 因为那都是曾经
,那些离开的前辈致敬你以前流的汗
,我似乎了疲惫 录音到早上六点半
,把握着成败得失 有兄弟们共患难
,这些让我变得强大变得能征惯战
,只想用自己的方式 谱写以后的人生
,彻夜练习的背后  希望美梦能成真
,有用不尽的力量跟命运较劲

,如果固执的台词让你不敢继续
,她就像注定的另一半在你的未来里
,可是又不一定会发生什么又不能在一起
,HOW TO love
,在那个年纪根本不想那么多
,你时常要在她回家的路上陪她聊很多
,在意她的每一个表情
,心事不敢表明
,如果是她的微笑给你你都不舍找零
,就算是暗恋她
,你也不敢去送她花
,怕遇到学校的八卦
,问及到成绩和爸妈
,你坚信再过几年你一定能够把她娶回家
,你坚定的想“我必须努力让她幸福啊”
,那些年错过的大雨
,那些年错过的爱情
,好想拥抱你拥抱错过的勇气
,曾经想征服全世界
,到最后回首才发现
,这世界点点滴滴全都是你
,那些年错过的大雨
,那些年错过的爱情
,好想告诉你告诉你我没忘记
,那天晚上满天星星
,平行时空下的约定
,再一次相遇我会紧紧抱着你
,我只想现在告诉你
,我还在为你努力
,我为你写下每一首歌不管你在哪里
,重新在说声sorry
,对你也对我自己
,如果能再来一次
,我会说I love you baby
,I wanna hold you baby
,never lose it
,touch my love
,I WANNA LOVE YOU AGAIN
,I DON'T WANNA JUST BE FRIEND
,请不要走
,在那时候
,我知道只有青春
,但是在时光面前只有这样才算见证
,就算有那么一天你不再会为我微笑
,就算有那么一天你不再会为我流泪
,就算有那么一天我们变的陌生
,请你记住你的青春
,那样的爱才是天生
,当时我们还不知道什么是爱
,我喜欢上你可能就是觉得你可爱
,他们欺负你我就上前去帮他们欺负你
,第一次心疼你但第一次离你那么近
,我怕你恨我却又单独找你麻烦
,他们猜我喜欢你我说你们少来
,但我靠欺负你接近你毕竟不是办法
,小道消息说你喜欢学习好的那就这么办吧
,我开始熬夜看书然后五点起
,我开始问老师问题也许能碰到你
,考试及格变成我唯一接近你的捷径
,我做的这一切就是为了让你瞧得起
,我们开始聊天 我们开始传纸条
,我们开始一起放学 开始变得有话聊
,我越来越相信我们可以永远在一起
,我和自己说我一定要追到你
,或许我们之间会有不开心的争吵
,或许我们的生活没有梦中那么美好
,但是只有你在我身边这才最重要
,不管遇到什么风雨我们都不会跌倒
,不管再多挫折坎坷也能保持微笑
,我相信 我会成为让你安心的依靠
,我知道我们之间还有那么多的困扰
,但那真的无所谓只要有你在就好
,不想去想的太多思绪依旧那么潦草
,我答应给你一颗真心它纯度那么高
,我答应这辈子一定会陪你到老
,亲爱的 嫁给我吧 我爱你

,抚平不安的内心
,一首恰似陈词滥调我清楚有谁会听
,就算会成为过客我宁做造梦的彗星
,one love ??
,（hook）
,Homie Run with me 当你感到力不从心
,Homie Run with me 继续奔跑穿过丛林
,Homie Run with me 还是最初的壮志雄心
,Run with me
,我早就不在乎汗水和疲惫
,不停奔跑人生没有暂停
,命运握在我的手心
,所以我会更加用心经营
,要感谢兄弟给我鼓励
,我会越过海洋山丘
,握紧拳头继续努力
,不到目的不会善罢甘休
,翱翔到宇宙看着地面
,但下坠更是像是历练
,直到我离开的那一天
,愿这一切值得纪念
,You don't even know my story
,我会诉说给你听
,You don't even know my name
,Y to da J

,因为太繁华的夜晚让你整晚都无法入眠
,你不想昙花一现就和梦境说再见
,自信是你的行李

,当你感到累了觉得无力感到困
,当你不再愿意相信别人只有恨
,我只能怀疑
,你是不是个real man
,我想你仔细看看面前这个real friend
,他比你更倒霉

,他过去稚嫩但现在更想认真
,伤口不会消除
,它只会更深
,但微笑可以保持
,比曾经更真

너는 내게 빠져 들어와 
헤어나올 수 없는

그런 여자란 Girl

다가가는 날 다가가는 날

, I'm giving up on the ending of what this could be
,
, Now I'm closing my eyes
, Cause I can't escape the morning
, I'm looking for the love I've felt before
,
, Suddenly I'm falling
, Through a heart that's all empty space
, Trying to follow what's gone but
, It's not enough to chase
,
, Remember when you told me
, You'll never leave me, calling for you
, But after all the time we've spent
, Now there is nothing left to hold onto
,
, To hold onto
,
, Nothing left
,
, Now there is nothing left
,
, Other memories of you
, Always stuck in rotation
, Giving up on just what we used to be, be
,
, Now I'm running out of fuel
, Cause I'm never replacing
, The fire of our love that burned before
,
, Suddenly I'm falling
, Through a heart that's all empty space
, Trying to follow what's gone but
, It's not enough to chase
,
, Remember when you tell me
, You'll never leave me, I've called it for you
, But after all the time we've spent
, Now there is nothing left to hold onto
, To hold onto
, To hold onto
, Now there is nothing left to hold onto
, To hold onto
, To hold onto
, Now there is nothing left...
, To hold onto
, There is nothing left to hold onto
, There is nothing left

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose
,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing
,And I was runnin' outta luck

,Wasn't nothin' like that
,Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
,She was in my math class
,Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
,Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
,The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
,It started off so innocent
,She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
,I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
,But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
,Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
,Got me daydreaming, man what
,I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
,Make it hard for me to stand up
,As time goes by, attractions getting deep and
,Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
,I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
,She wrote a note that said "You ever had sex before"
,Damn
,
,And I ain't never did this before no (x8)
,
,I wrote back and said "Of course I had sex before"
,Knowing I was frontin'
,I said I'm like a pro baby
,Knowing I was stuntin'
,But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
,Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
,But, she don't know that
,So she done wrote back and told me
,"Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
,My mama gone for the weekend
,So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'"
,That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
,Baby you done woke my lil' man up
,I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
,Teacher please don't make me stand up
,I wrote back like "Yeah baby sound like a plan"
,Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
,But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
,Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
,Fuck
,
,And I ain't never did this before no (x8)
,
,You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
,I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
,I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
,And most of all I'm praying "God don't let me bust quick"
,I'm watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
,Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
,I'm in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin'
,With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
,That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
,And a nigga roll over on top
,And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
,On me, ooh girl don't stop
,It's time for action
,Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practiced
,But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
,"I wanna get something off my mental
,I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle cause"

,I feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
,Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
,My life's like one great big ball of shit,
,If I could just put it all in to all I spit,
,Instead I always try to swallow it,
,Instead of staring at this wall and shit,
,While I sit writers block sick of all this shit,
,Can't call it shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
,If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
,This is it, last straw, that’s all, that’s it,
,I ain't dealing with another fucking politic,
,I'm like a skillet bubbling, till it filters up,
,I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
,Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
,My cup run'ith over I've done and filled it up,
,The pen explodes and busts and ink spills my guts,
,You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
,But I'm a show you, what, you gonna feel my rush,
,You dont feel it then it must be to real to touch,
,Build a dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
,Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up,
,Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be,

,You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
,What you close minded fucks were to blind to see,
,Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
,Out this world and ain't no one out their mind as me,
,You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine,
,All I need's a line but sometimes,
,I dont always find the words to rhyme,
,To express how i'm really feeling at that time,
,Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes,
,It's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
,The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
,This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
,I'm desperate at my desk if I could just get the rest,
,Of this shit off my chest, again, stuck in this slump,
,Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped,
,But wait here comes something,
,Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
,Crinkle it up and throw that shit out,
,I'm fizzling now thought I had figured it out,
,Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
,But I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade,
,Sionide I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
,Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want,
,I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain’t a quitter,
,I'm a sit here till I get enough,
,For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point,
,Put some oil in your joints,
,Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
,An MC's worst dream I make them tense they hate me,
,See me and shake like a chain-link fence,
,By the looks of them you would swear Jaws was coming,
,By the scream of them you would swear i'm sawing someone,
,By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
,It's now or never and tonight It's all or nothing,
,Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
,He pinky promised, I dont think he's honest,
,I be back baby I just got to beat this clock,
,Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch,
,Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race,
,and I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face,
,Bitch, I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice,
,Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
,If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
,If I have half a chance I grab it, rabbit run.

,But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
,She so fine
,Type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head
,All my homies like go 'head

I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'

I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'
Til I'm free fallin
I live for the nights

I am tryna holla got that ink up on my colla'
Drinkin til it's nada, isn't whiskey I don't bother
My bitches ain't no dimes they be mothafuckin' dollars
So we stack our drinks up high, skyscrappin' til we taller
Ring ring hit that up show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood dance until you get enough
Ring ring hit that up show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood dance until you get enough 

Imma do what I want, whatever
Imma rage til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night 
Free fallin'

I'm a grim reaper when I'm blarin' out your speaker 
Killin' out the weaker welcome to the final feature
My head is in the clouds, you can say that I'm a dreamer 
But I bang it super loud turn that bitch into a screamer

Imma do what I want, whatever
Imma rage til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night

,I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
,I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
,I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
,They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
,I didn't know that I could get this low
,
,And I, and I don't know where to go
,And I, and I, know, know
,And I, and I don't know where to go
,And I don't know where to go
,And I don't know where to go
,
,I see a dark reflection in my dashboard
,Don't even know where I'm driving to anymore
,I think about us back together someday
,What you doing this Sunday
,I needed space so I left home
,But now I'm desperate for the things I know
,Like how you made me laugh on a bad day
,
,I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
,I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
,I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
,They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
,I didn't know that I could get this low
,
,And I don't know where to go
,
,Promises promises, year after year on my knees
,Paradise knocks for my future, just have to believe
,Flood flood flood in the streets so they said
,Blood blood blood in the streets of my head
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you
,
,Just listen to Father and he’ll set you up to suc-seeds
,In the soil to dry to produce what we
,Need for our family trees
,Cutting down to our knees
,We look up to the sky to retell the old
,Stories of glorious, battles victorious
,Brothers notorious, empires turn to dust
,Men turned delirious, reasons mysterious
,Destruction comes near to us, our mothers shed tears for us
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you
,
,Lived on my knees
,They told me that you’d set me free
,We lost our years together because of the fear
,Know i’m never gonna make it there
,I just wanted Eden on repeated sunny days
,The land below me cracks and tears
,Look into the sky through the thick and rainy haze
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you

,My heartbeat's beating so loud
,Pounding out of rhythm through the air
,Empty bottles left to tryin' it out
,Cuz you gone and it hurts like hell

,Then I close my eyes, off my day,
,You want conflict to broken, when you gotta someone:
,That's my heartbreak definition
,That's my heartbreak definition
,But my heart's still wishing, that's a definition

,Then I close my eyes, off my day,
,You want conflict to broken, when you gotta someone:
,That's my heartbreak definition
,I throw my hands up, crying for love,
,Think you did the demolition, that's a definition
,What you did, yeah?
,What you done-done?

,When I met you in the summer

,When we're getting down down down down down
,Everything you've searched for is right here on the dance floor
,And you want it now now now now now

,Seeing through your eyelids
,I know you like it when the music gets loud

,We should throw it back right now now now
,And in a little while I see you start to smile
,And here you thought you forgot that you knew how
,Baby, I can't help it
,Nobody else can burn me up like you've got me up in flames
,From our very first kiss to our very last wish
,You'll be running through my veins
,

,Come back, come back to me, my lover
,Take a chance, and touch the stars
,Start to dance to the beat of your heart

,Lift up your hands, and touch the stars
,The stars the stars the stars the stars the stars...
,Touch the stars

,
,
,You paint a picture in my mind
,You want to leave it all behind
,In a world that's turning all the time
,Nothing could stop me longing for your eyes
,I won't let it die
,I can feel you when you're not around
,When the night gets cold
,I won't
,I won't
,I won't
,I won't
,I won't
,Be alone
,We won't be alone
,This lake of fire burns my skin
,How could love wear so thin
,I'm sinking in the hollow ground
,Nothing can stop me wanting you somehow
,I won't let it die
,I can feel you when you're not around
,When the night gets cold
,I won't
,I won't
,I won't

,I can feel you when you're not around
,When the night gets cold
,We won't be alone
,
,There's a reason she's alone
,You can't pin her down
,Because no one needs her home
,Or needs her around, she says
,"There's beauty in the hills
,A chip in the sky
,So don't be sad because I roam
,It keeps me alive."
,
,To impress her - it's too damn hard
,To stay loyal without going too far
,If I see her again promise I won't
,Cry
,

,She wasn't back tonight
,And I don't know about you
,My money's on the night
,It takes her away like I do
,My charm is twinkling out of her eyes
,Of her eyes
,
,She will never grow old
,Or change her mind
,She'll talk about it later on
,From seeing sights
,There's something wonderful and odd about the escape
,While you want them to be gone
,You want them to stay
,
,To impress her it's just so damn hard
,I want her back, please don't go too far
,If I see her again promise I won't
,Cry
,
,To impress her is just too damn hard
,To stay loyal without going too far
,If I see her again, promise I won't
,Cry
,
,She doesn't come back much
,No one misses her like I do
,I hope she's having fun
,Doing what she wants to
,And send a postcard or two from the sights
,Sometime
,
,To impress her is just too damn hard
,And I want her back but she's gone too far
,If I see her again, promise I won't
,Cry

,I woke up pissed off today
,And lately everyone feels fake
,Somewhere I lost a piece of me
,Smoking cigarettes on balconies
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,Last year took a toll on me
,But I made it with you next to me
,Around the world and back again
,I hope you're waiting at the end
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,I'll be loud for you
,I got you I promise
,Let me be honest
,Love is a road that goes both ways
,When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But I'm holding on to something
,Wake up if you feel nothing
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,There was a time that I was sober
,What I got to do to show you
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you
,So I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,But you gotta be there for me too

,We were all lost
,Almost something so close
,On the outlines of your west coast
,We were waving red balloons
,We were wide-eyed
,Oh, we only lived in highlights
,A delusion, some were twilight
,We were dumb and beautiful
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,And no one else would ever do
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you

,I only wanna be

,We were perish
,We were subtle, we were drastic
,We were calm, we were dramatic
,We were fantasy and fear
,And you changed me
,You were sunny and you faced me
,Yeah, you saw me and encouraged me
,Like a tourist, souvenir (woah)
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute

,We were both young when I first saw you.
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
,I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
,See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
,See you make your way through the crowd
,And say, "Hello."
,Little did I know...
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes,
,Escape this town for a little while.
,Oh, oh.
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,But you were everything to me,
,I was begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
,I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
,Romeo, save me.
,They're trying to tell me how to feel.
,This love is difficult but it's real.
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say...

,I stare at the window
,Watch the darkness turn the light
,It likes moon glows
,I know that I won't sleep tonight
,Cos there's fire in my heart
,And I don't know where it start
,I'm searching where I know
,And if I had crystal ball
,Would wanna know it all
,The mysteries had the show
,Because of this midnight
,And I dreaming while awake
,Midnight
,And I dreaming while awake
,My body so tired
,But my mind won't let me sleep
,Getting higher and higher
,And less plausibility
,Cos I can feel it in my bones
,I can winning take throw
,There's nobody else want more

Turn off the light and close your eyes
It`s the night that you will dream
You feeling me you getting closer
Without knowing call on me
I imagine that both we will run
Together up in the sky
I`m missing your voice every day
And touching your lips when you cry … x2
When you cry … x3
Touching your lips when you cry …
When you cry … x3

,From the holes that you made in you sleeves
,And I shake and I pull and I scream
,And I rip and I stare and I stay

,无能为力唤回梦的仁慈

Look this is my life, and it's a battle within
I gotta survive, even if I'm sinnin to win
And if I show no remorse I reap the devil's reward
He said he'd, give me riches but I'm lookin for more
When I was young, witnessed my dad, standin for right
Black pride in him even though he passin for white
Took years from my life, now I'm missin the man
Moms on some other shit and now I'm missin the plan
And so I'm... stuck in this fuck-a-marole
All the lessons to a young teen baby was cold
Then my pimpin-ass Uncle put me up on the game
It really ain't no love it's 'bout this, paper mayne
Put me in a position, got me out on a mission
Collectin from the hoes turned on to my pimpin
A nigga from Memphis dealin with life as a struggle
This is the gift I was given so I just live by my hustle

, + (singer, ad libbing at times)
(Keep hustlin) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
(Keep, flowin) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin to me

,
Now I'm just gettin by, and it's FUCKIN with me
See others doin big thangs they was nothin to me
I'm seein what I used to be, and it's lookin legit
Got my hands on some music, started FUCKIN with it
Put it down hard, then I started bumpin to this
I let some others get a dose and they was NUTTIN to this
Let me check my connections cause we go back in the day
Say they was lookin for 'dro, heard I was hustlin hay
Got me connin my niggaz, spittin game to my hoes
This my opportunity I feel like anything goes
I was never 'sposed to see the new millenium mayne
And I refuse to let my dad die in vain
So I give it my all, you feel my struggle and pain
If you ain't feelin what I'm spittin trick you late to the game
But the closest ones to me know I'm holdin it down
You gon' feel me one day, we gon' be heard in the town

,MINE IS MINE STAGE A COMEBACK
,当我转身的那一刻我知道你在
,从天堂到地狱都没想过抵赖
,I KILL MY DEMON 获得新的记载
,KEEP ALL YOU MONEY KEEP ALL YOU LIFE
,在逆境之中FEELING 把对手通通击败
,KEEP ALL YOU MONEY KEEP ALL YOU LIFE
,踩碎所有绊脚的石头把前辈一一替代
,踢开挡住路的狗 伸出口袋里的手
,接下所有伤你的暗箭然后再往前走
,所谓清醒的人绝对不会活在梦里头
,每当黑夜散去之后 阳光洒落在你肩头
,想要面前影子强壮那就活着并且战斗
,兴奋的不断颤抖
,割下天真烂漫溃烂生出的腐肉
,扛下虚伪赞叹背后古老的诅咒
,坐井观天道貌岸然何时停止繁衍战乱
,谁有能够真心陪你共度患难
,黑白对错话题还是留给后人拿去比划判断
,门缝外的人们都快进来看看
,MINE IS MINE STAGE A COMEBACK
,当我转身的那一刻我知道你在
,从天堂到地狱都没想过抵赖
,I KILL MY DEMON 获得新的记载
,特立独行换来的是冷眼旁观 指指点点
,就像塑料兄弟总在关键时刻义正言辞扣扣减减
,表面一套背后一套的人都有一张狰狞相似的嘴脸
,哈！说的太明显那又怎样
,快来观光这景点 看 不同景象
,陷在沼泽发光发亮双手发烫
,能够拿到关键球又怎会没有一颗 大心脏
,赢了 太激荡 往你手里塞个牌子“轻拿要轻放”
,输了别迷茫 子弹上膛后的猎人随时在等待虎口夺羊
,他说没有多强 那就别说多忙
,就拿出最强的配置落场
,掀起波浪
,在不同层次位置 gain my face
,只有亲手杀了自己才能获得新的开始
,撕碎每张日记还有没写完的白纸
,MINE IS MINE STAGE A COMEBACK
,当我转身的那一刻我知道你在
,从天堂到地狱都没想过抵赖
,I KILL MY DEMON 获得新的记载
,扯开刚愈合的伤疤
,挥舞拳头却死于伤杀
,逃脱故事框架 最后却败给偏差
,拥抱后 刺痛的背心
,侧脸那 一抹奸诈的背景
,望向鲜血流进杯里再与死神对饮
,抬头看 云未散 斩落心脏风雨狂作电闪雷鸣
,每个惊醒的深夜
,拿起又放下
,沾满鲜血的唇枪舌剑
,感悟所有进攻后的没能如愿
,直到真相浮现 才发现
,这一切都是梦魇
,缠绕你 一层又一层
,绞尽脑汁摆脱却又在下一轮相逢
,天地阴阳胜败无不相制相衡
,还有一到夜里就会做贼心虚的人
,listen是不是有小鬼在敲你门

,Hit a fork in the road and the devil occupies both lanes
,Stumble as a back step
,Feel the pressure on my soul as the airs leaving out my frame
,Now breathe (in and out), breathe (in and out), breathe (in and out), breathe
,I’m living on my last breath
,It’s all final when it’s final when you fade into a blacked out dream
,Until my last breath
,I hope my house been fully accessed
,Pastures to my regrets
,I hope you're all in past tense
,Marry a girl with an accent
,Carry this world's tilted axis
,Make some major changes in some statements till I’m ashes
,I preach in hour glasses
,So you can turn me upside down and watch as time passes
,Drugs are bad habits
,Before I’m in that casket
,And the happiness I’m searching for
,I hope I grasp it
,And I hope I fully grab it
,And never take for granted
,All the looks little things in life and still believe in magic
,Look back at all my fans
,I know that I made them drag hits
,And I hope that I never look for love
,I hope that it just happens
,And if I have kids
,I hope that it was trustful
,But worth it in the end because they all became successful
,And I hope my last breath was something truly breath full
,But I wish I could have said much more before I died and left you

,I welcome drama, with open arms and holdin' a llama
,The whole persona is vodka bottles and marijuana
,The whole pinana was rockin inspired for my mama
,I’m a warrior
,I went into jail for the drama
,
,I would never want to have birth and fail as a father
,I would never want the illest to kill the manana
,The half moon on the bank of the river’s devotion
,That’s the stab wood born from the killer emotion
,I wasn’t raised by darkness, militant motion
,I wasn’t raised by the thought of the still in the ocean
,I would never question the power of a god pain
,Until I saw his body the color of dark rain
,He recited the third chapter of allah flame
,And he ignited the third chapter of allah flame
,I’m livin' on my last breath
,Hit a fork in the road and the devil occupies both lanes

,"Dance With The Devil"
,I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
,his primary concern, was making a million
,being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
,he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
,a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
,nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
,she put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
,her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
,he started hanging out selling bags in the projects
,checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
,he was fascinated by material objects
,but he understood money never bought respect
,he built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
,but got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
,so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
,you see me and niggas like this have never been equal
,I dont project my insecurities on other people
,he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
,so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
,a feeble minded young man with infinite potential
,the product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental
,coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
,dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
,but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed
,Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
,you propably only did a month for minor offences
,ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
,but then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
,dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
,but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
,devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
,there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
,So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
,to get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
,starting fights over little shit, up on the block
,stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
,working overtime for making money for the crack spot
,hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
,fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
,tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
,he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
,but when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
,they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
,any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
,any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
,even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
,but only a real thug can stab someone till they die
,standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
,Billy realized that these men were well guarded
,and they wanted to test him, before business started
,suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
,so now he had a choice between going back to his life
,or making money with made men, up in the cife
,his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
,a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
,and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three
,Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
,you propably only did a month for minor offences
,ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
,but then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
,dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
,but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
,devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
,there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
,They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
,smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
,until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
,three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
,and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
,walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
,they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
,"this is it kid, now you got your chance to be raw..."
,so Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
,and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
,she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
,they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
,screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
,the shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
,so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw
,the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
,they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
,blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
,and then they all proceeded to rape her violently
,Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn
,ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
,her broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned
,when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
,one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new .22
,they told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
,and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
,he thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
,and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
,I'm falling and I can't turn back
,I'm falling and I can't turn back
,Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
,he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
,and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
,cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
,but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
,'cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
,she looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
,she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
,his whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
,his corruption had succesfully changed his fate
,and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
,working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
,he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
,and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
,but only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
,and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
,and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
,they say death take you to a better place but I doubt it
,after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
,and listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
,'cause I was there when Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
,and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
,in fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
,and every street cipher listening to little thugs flow
,he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
,the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
,white, brown, yellow and black color is not restricted
,you have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
,and you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
,there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
,so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
,because a dance with the devil might last you forever
,Oh y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? Well it’s not
,You didn’t count on a fallen angel getting back
,into the grace of god and coming after you
,Ya’ll niggas ain’t shit
,Your producers ain’t shit. Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit
,I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
,Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!
,Go ‘head and grip Glocks
,I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
,You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
,I’ll watch you topple flat
,Put away your rings and holla back
,Can’t freestyle, you’re screwed off the top like bottle caps
,Beneath the surface
,I’m overheatin’ your receiving circuits by unleashin' deeper verses
,than priests speak in churches
,What you preach is worthless
,Your worship defeat the purpose
,Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
,Beyond what y'all fathom
,I shit on cats and jaw tap ‘em
,Show no compassion like havin’ a straight-faced orgasm
,Tour jack ‘em
,Have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friend’s dick
,In the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist
,Diabolic
,A one-man brigade spreading cancer plague
,This fuckin’ a pussy’s face
,Holdin' a hand grenade
,So if I catch you bluffin'
,Faggot, you’re less than nothin'
,I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
,You motherfuckers are nothing, you cannot harm me
,I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
,Storm the planet huntin' you down, ‘cause I’m on a mission
,To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
,Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
,You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
,I’m 'bout to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips
,Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
,I’m like time itself, I’m gonna kill you inevitably
,Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece
,I’m illmatic, you won’t make it home like Jerome’s niece
,I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
,And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
,This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
,So you’re nothing, like diversity without equality
,And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
,Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
,Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7
,You’re like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect
,You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
,Your mind is empty and spacious
,Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture and erases
,Face it, you’re too basic
,You’re never gonna make it
,Like children walking through Antarctica, butt naked
,by og
,
,Ok Hector, I'm reloaded hahah
,Fuck, yuh, my bad
,Ey, yuh
,Bitch uh
,Ey, Kung Lao wristbands looking like a hitman
,But a nigga tryna hit a lick man
,Took her to the bathroom fucked her through the zip man
,Left her legs shaking like the crip dance

,Pay that man and told him no tip man
,Pacquiao pack got my eyes low, it man
,I'm all gold like the rent man ey
,Go

,Fast lane, okay ay
,Dip on that bitch like a ten piece
,Shake and bake told that bitch catch me
,Shoot from the hip I'm a hippie
,Suck on my dick like a sippy
,Watch all that shit where your lips be
,That's why yo ass looking sickly
,She said my dick looking spiffy
,And that I hustle like Nipsey
,I keep the crack in my sock, damn
,I keep the scope on my mop, damn
,White bitch she giving me top, damn
,Lil Pump I love the ciroc, damn
,Slapping that bitch with my pistol, ay

,The whole industry been in shambles
,Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
,Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
,Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
,I like my raps extra prolific
,So freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
,And I won’t mention my ten thousand hours in training
,While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
,And now we look at the competition as quick submission
,They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
,What this about, is it money or skill?
,Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
,You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
,
,I can see y’all incapable
,To be the God MSs, you know me well
,Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
,Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
,I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
,Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
,We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
,
,I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
,I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
,Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
,Every time I start writing I get sentimental
,This shit is just not fair
,But why the fuck should I care?
,The story of your life here
,Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
,
,This is what they want, I’m the one
,This is vintage from nineteen-eighty-somethin'
,I’m the son of the pioneer that got you niggas on
,Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
,I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
,He probably let me get some head inside the residence
,I’m in the White House going all out
,Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
,Nothing more influential than rap music
,I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
,I mix black soul with some rock and roll
,They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
,
,I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
,I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
,Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental

,And long were nights of aloneness.
,How often have you sailed in my dreams
,And now in my awakening?
,Here I am - ready to go
,Into the seasonless world where we shall reap and love
,In the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets
,And my spirit has entered your heart.
,And in your sleep your dreams were MY dreams
,And your breath was upon my face.
,Ohhh to know the pain of too much tenderness.
,You are not trapped or tamed.
,Without a care and without grief. You shall be free...
,Give up the fight and learn to surrender
,All you've gotta do is...

,Don't wanna keep this heart imprisoned

,Give up the fight and learn to surrender
,All you've gotta do is...
,Give up the fight and learn to surrender
,You know there's nothing to it
,... there's nothing to it...
,Let there be no scales
,To weigh your unknown treasure
,It is when you give of yourself
,That you truly give.
,Oh to know the pain of too much tenderness
,You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams
,Give up the fight and learn to surrender
,All you've gotta do is
,Give up the fight and learn to surrender
,All you've gotta do is

,Got up early, found something’s missing
,My only name
,No one else sees, but I got stuck
,And soon forever came
,Stopped pushing on for just a second
,Then nothing’s changed
,Who am I this time, where's my name
,Guess it crept away
,No one's calling for me at the door
,And unpredictable won't bother anymore
,And silently gets harder to ignore
,Look straight ahead, there’s nothing left to see
,What’s done is done, this life has got its hold on me
,Just let it go, what now can never be
,I forgot that I might see
,So many beautiful things
,I forgot that I might need
,To find out what life could bring
,Ku He Ting Yu zai na ......
,Take this happy ending away
,It's all the same
,God won't waste this simplicity
,On possibility
,Get me up, wake me up, dreams are filling
,This trace of blame
,Frozen still I thought I could stop
,Now who's gonna wait
,No one's calling for me at the door
,And unpredictable won't bother anymore
,And silently gets harder to ignore
,Look straight ahead, there’s nothing left to see

,Just let it go, what now can never be
,So many beautiful things
,So many beautiful things
,So many beautiful things

,Can I change my mind
,Did I think things through
,It was once my life
,It was my life at one time

,When I close my eyes
,I see your sorrow
,I feel you with me
,Every heartbeat of yours
,When I close my eyes

,Every heartbeat of yours
,Silent prayers
,Falling shadows
,Stars saving the night
,Saving the night
,Like you saved my life
,Eyes closed I'm lying here
,Only angels hear how I whisper...
,Your name... your name...
,
,Love until it hurts, Love until you feel,
,Sadness in your heart, Sorrow you must heal
,Love until it hurts, Love until you find,
,All thats left to give, Is everything you live for
,Love until it hurts, Love until you bleed
,When you know its real, Love is all you feel
,Love until the stars, Are dancing in the sky
,Lighting up your life, Showing where the truth lies
,Love until it hurts
,Love until it hurts, Love until it breaks
,The emptiness you fear, Decisions that you make clear
,Love until it hurts, Love until you feel
,The memories of the past, No longer meant to be here
,Sometimes you need more than you can say
,Shaking on the inside
,Longing just to hear the words you say
,Love until it hurts dont fade away

讲述角色A 冒着危险进入不同维度的空间去寻找迷失的角色B的故事
,死的时候
,要埋在一起
我一直以為
我左眼皮跳的時候 是你在想我

到後面我才發現
每次我左眼皮跳
是我在想你
作曲 : 几鱼
作词 : 几鱼
别人看你越发稳重 波澜不惊
你看自己却是寡言少语 触目惊心

其实孤独并不可怕
只要你学会了自己与自己对话

而我一个人朝朝暮暮走遍了天涯海角

像好不容易遇见你
你却把我所有的情愫都消耗完


愿我一人成光 不会再有伤痛


注：感谢笑笑协助我起歌名 么么踹
作曲 : 凡以三
作词 : 凡以三
我喜歡你身上的味道

像大太陽下的青草地

超级喜欢的一首歌，今天拿到了谱子，捣鼓了一晚上，终于做出来，自己也有编和弦。做了改动，希望喜欢！！！

冰凉侵蚀回忆
阴霾的波纹推阔
我念你 念你呢
在我空旷的心海里

你宠溺的语气
温柔的呢喃细语
如一面幻觉
我渴望它 却捉不住

你走了
拥挤进我心里
好似一个梦
没来得及亲吻
如烟一点点消散

在蓝色的心海里
孤立着一座城
那是你残留的回忆

空空的 淡淡的
呼唤一声你的名字
回音穿梭了整个世纪
久久荡漾没有回答

如旧漂泊
孤立着一缕空
飘散摸不到墙角
那抹空 没有你

我在没有你的城
午夜零末00.00
写了这篇文 
在你不愿停留的城里
在你逐渐飘散的旋律

一咛叮 一星点 一幻散

,If our love was a fairy tale
,I would charge in and rescue you
,On a yacht baby we would sail
,To an island where we'd say I do
,And if we had babies they would look like you
,It'd be so beautiful if that came true
,You don't even know how very special you are
,Chorus
,You leave me breathless
,You're everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can't believe that you're mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you're leaving me
,Breathless
,And if our love was a story book
,We would meet on the very first page
,The last chapter would be about
,How I'm thankful for the life we've made
,And if we had babies they would have your eyes
,I would fall deeper watching you give life
,You don't even know how very special you are
,You leave me breathless
,You're everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can't believe that you're mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you're leaving me
,You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
,You're like an angel
,The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
,You're something special
,I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me
,But all I can do is try
,Every day of my life
,You leave me breathless

, Can you hear them screaming out your name?

, They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, They're written down in eternity
, But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
, When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
, Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
,
, When the world is callin' out your name, begging you to fight
, Pick yourself up once more
, Pick yourself up 'cause

,Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
,Darlin' I will be lovin' you till we're seventy

,People killin' People dyin'
,Children hurt and you hear them crying
,Can you practice what you preach

,Overseas ya we tryin' to stop terrorism
,But we still got terrorists here livin'
,In the U.S.A, the big C.I.A
,The bloods and the crips, and the KKK
,But if you only got love for your own ways
,Then you only leave space to discriminate
,To discriminate only generates hate
,And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
,Madness is what you demonstrate
,And that's exactly how anger works and operates
,Man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight
,Take control of your mind and meditate
,Let your soul gravitate
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)

,I close my eyes
,But dare not sleep
,You made my dreams
,Like a ghost in the machine
,All the years go by
,And we do not speak

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time
,The Void had been pushed back before by the power of mortals.
,The gods couldn’t do it,but maybe we can.
,What can yet be blessed can yet be restored.
,One way or another, divinity will survive.
,Divinity will survive...
,The gods are dead,long live the Godwoken.
,You have already unleashed some powers left within you, but there is the great well of possibility still untapped.
,You cannot stop until you ascend to the highest heights of your power.
,You cannot stop until you become divine.
,It is not the work effete,It is the work of devoid
,I am bound, but not defeated.
,Not yet...
,Until become divine
,Divine～
,Until become divine
,Divinity will survive
,Divinity will survive
,The Godwoken were alive, but what of the gods?

,Your spirit up above

,Living my brain up in the cloud
,Falling like ashes to the ground
,Hoping my feelings they would drown
,But they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing

,还要多少时间
,才能停止想念
,在这样的夜晚
,你是否和我一样不知道该找谁聊天
,女人哭花了双眼
,男人湿透了衣衫
,两个人相拥却孤单
,留下了什么遗憾在身边在昨天
,从一开始相互牵绊到争吵
,用了多少天
,从承诺出发一路提心吊胆
,只因为不想走散
,如果不爱了就别勉为其难
,虽然我也不想说声再见
,用手画出的圆却总不圆满
,孤独患者一个人的狂欢
,如果留不住就别勉为其难
,就算痛也不让自己难堪
,总想有人去管别袖手旁观
,总会等到对的人说晚安

,At first I was afraid.
,I was petrified.
,I kept thinking I could never live
,Without you by my side.
,But then I spent so many nights
,Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
,I grew strong.
,I learned how to get along.
,And so you're back from outer space.
,I just walked in to find you here
,Without that look upon your face.
,I should have changed my fucking lock.
,I would have made you leave your key
,If I'd have known for just one second
,You'd be back to bother me.
,Oh now go.
,Walk out the door.
,Just turn around now.
,You're not welcome anymore.
,Weren't you the one
,Who tried to break me with desire?
,Did you think I'd crumble?
,Did you think I'd lay down and die?
,Oh not I.
,I will survive.
,As long as I know how to love
,I know I'll be alive.
,I've got all my life to live.
,I've got all my love to give.
,I will survive.
,I will survive.
,It took all the strength I had
,Just not to fall apart.
,I'm trying hard to mend
,The pieces of my broken heart.
,And I spent oh so many nights
,Just feeling sorry for myself.
,I used to cry.
,But now I hold my head up high.
,And you'll see me with somebody new.
,I'm not that stupid little person
,Still in love with you.
,And so you thought you'd just drop by,
,And you expect me to be free.
,But now I'm saving all my lovin'
,For someone who's lovin' me.
,Oh now go.
,Walk out the door.
,Just turn around now.
,You're not welcome anymore.

,可是我有很多party等着你来嗨

,对未来的猜想全部都有你的情景
,别问我要不要紧，现在你要小心

我正有此打算更靠近你一些

Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten “¡Ay Bendito!”
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
Favorito favorito baby
Pasito a pasito suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito

是的， 你知道我已注视你一会了
今天我一定要与你共舞一曲
DY
看，你的目光在热切呼唤着我
指引我通往你心之路我定风雨无阻
Oh
你，你就是磁铁而我是被你吸引的金属
我正接近着你我正周密的策划
意念驱使着我加快了脚步
Oh yeah
如今，如今我正享受着行进的快感
我身体的每个细胞都在祈求着更多
我一定要义无反顾的到你身边
轻轻地
我想贴近你的颈边轻轻地呼吸
让我附在你耳边向你吐露真言
让你牢记我的诺言哪怕我不在你身边
慢慢地
我想用吻慢慢地将你的衣衫褪去
将你的谜题画在墙上
让你的身体成为我手稿的绘板
起来，起来
动起来
我想每日清晨看见你头发起舞
我想成为你生命的韵律
我想你向我的唇给与暗示
你最喜欢它亲吻的地方
最喜欢的，宝贝
让我越过你身体的危险地带
直到你抑制不住尖叫
直至你忘记你的姓名
Daddy Yankee
如果我向你索求一个吻，请给我
我知道你正在考虑当中
我已尝试了一段时间
宝贝这只是一个吻 给我吧
你知道每每见你我的心怦怦直跳
你知道我的心在寻找着它跳动的你
来从我的唇里尝尝你的唇是什么滋味
我想 我想看看你能爱地多深
我并不着急，我想带着旅行的心情
始于风平浪静，之后疾风暴雨
一步一步，温柔再温柔一点
我们开始水乳交融，一点一点
当你用熟练的技巧吻我
我发觉是你对我轻柔的挑逗
一步一步，温柔再温柔一点
我们开始水乳交融，一点一点
你的美如同未完成的拼图
但我余有拼凑的一角
轻轻地
我想贴近你的颈边轻轻地呼吸
让我附在你耳边向你吐露真言
让你牢记我的诺言哪怕我不在你身边
轻轻地
我想用吻慢慢地将你衣衫褪去
在墙上写下你的难题
让你的身体成为我手绘的画板
起来，起来，动起来
我想每日清晨看见你头发起舞
我想成为你生命的韵律
我想你向我的唇给与暗示
你最喜欢它亲吻的地方
最喜欢的，宝贝
让我越过你身体的危险地带
直到你抑制不住尖叫
直至你忘记你的姓名
轻轻地
让我们在波多黎各的海滩完成这个仪式
直到拍起的海浪叫到 哦我的天
直到给你留下属于我的烙印
一步一步，温柔再温柔一点
我们开始水乳交融，一点一点
我想你向我的唇给与暗示
你最喜欢它亲吻的地方
最喜欢的，宝贝
一步一步，温柔再温柔一点
我们开始水乳交融，一点一点
直到你抑制不住尖叫
直至你忘记你的姓名
轻轻地,

,Light bleeds through my darkest night
,Blurs the wrong with the right
,Everyone else fades away
,'Til there's nothing but your face
,
,How am I supposed to choose?
,Between what I know is right and you?
,Break down yet another wall
,'Til nothing is left of me at all
,
,Stripping the soul out of my body
,Slipping slow out ahead this party
,I'm going down
,
,And I'm taking you with me
,Every second I stay is another step back and further from forgiveness
,And every second I stay is another step towards a choice I cannot live with
,But I want this
,But I want this
,I'm going down
,And I'm taking you with me
,
,Eyes wandering everywhere
,'Til they meet yours and stay
,Pictures worth a thousand words
,But it's not you it's her
,Drink color of the dress you've worn
,Still faint as it hit the floor
,I wished we have never met
,That night I can't forget
,
,Stripping the soul out of my body
,Slipping slow out ahead this party
,I'm going down
,
,And I know
,Every second I stay is another step back and further from forgiveness
,And every second I stay is another step towards a choice I cannot live with
,But I want this
,But I want this
,I'm going down
,And I'm taking you with me
,
, Been trying to make this work for us
, When we know our love has turned to dust
, This feelings one we’ve gotta trust
, Don't wanna lose it all
, But good things they fall sometimes
,
, What are we still doing here
, Pushing ourselves through another year
, Losing all our colors
, Can't seem to make any others
,
, It's been so long this time we shared
, It's been too long since you still cared about me
,
, What are we still doing here
, Has this all been out of some kind of fear
, Of losing all the color we once held near
, Ohhh
, It was so strong the love we shared
, But now we just don’t care
, Ohhh

,The lights are so bright but they never blind me.
,Welcome to New York.
,So bright, they never blind me.

,
,
,Time feels like it's slipping away from me
,Rewind to the days where we ran free
,Locked in where these colors fade back to gray
,But hold on 'cause I'm going to break away
,I hear you calling for
,me to lead my lights out and see through
,a sky that's bright now to meet you
,and make the stars come out
,Could I fix these
,Lost and fragmented pieces
,of forgotten hope that I needed
,and pretend they're not all gone?
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, I'll make an escape
,
,Float back to these oceans where I fall asleep
,I swim up even though I drown into the deep
,Lights flick as the pendelum ceases swings
,It's only seconds 'til these walls cave in
,I'm asking you to help wake me
,from these nightmares and save me
,let my thoughts fade away to memories
,that all made perfect sense
,Hyponotize me,
,this twilight where I can think clear
,and make this wish that you'll be here
,to stop these falling tears
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, I'll make an escape

,Everyday and night, I’ve been thinking all about
,About the songs that we sang
,About the times we used to have
,All I could think about
,Is just you and I
,Walking along the streets
,Singing songs together, songs together
,24/7 wanna know how you feel
,Don’t know if you still care
,About the times we used to share
,Cuz its seems like you have left, to a different place
,Far away from me
,You have moved on with your life
,I’m no longer on your mind
,But you’re still not out of mine
,I’ve been drowning in my thoughts thinking you were never with me
,Screaming into air reminiscing what we could be
,But honestly it was all just empty promises that
,You and I both know that it would never be reality
,Being with you was the safest feeling that I’ve ever had
,But now thats fucking gone and you will never ever look back
,Now it seems like I’m the only one who’s hurting while you
,Went off to the great escape to find yourself a better place
,I’m no longer on your mind
,But you’re still not out of mine
,I can’t keep anything by my side
,Your gone, you’ve left me here all alone
,Please come, I still need you by my side
,I’ve lost, you’ve won with you final dance
,You’ve shot me, down right from where I stand
,I want you, but you’d never take my hand
,I’m no longer on your mind
,But you’re still not out of mine

,This girl moved into my apartment (one day)
,One look at her my heart was stopping (heartbreak)
,I did whatever she was asking
,She said "maybe later catch you in the elevator"
,A couple days we got to hanging (real close)
,Since now she wasn't even taken (no no)
,I made a move she said "baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon"
,She got that smile and that body is to die for
,One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry
,'Cause I found a girl
,Who's in love with a girl
,She said that she tried
,But she's not into guys
,Oh, why? Tell me why
,Did I fall for those eyes?
,She said I was nice
,But she's not into guys
,I found a girl
,I should've known to walk away then
,I should've left that alone
,But why'd you call me on the phone we'll be hanging again
,Under the premise of friends
,But now she only talks to me about some other woman she says
,She got that smile and that body is to die for
,One of a kind and that's why it makes me cry
,'Cause I found a girl
,Who's in love with a girl

,I found a girl
,Oh oh oh... (I found a girl)
,Oh oh oh...
,She putting up her defense
,'Cause her recent pushed her over the deep end
,Now the girls are coming over for the weekend
,If you didn't get an invitation, she will resend

,All these kinds of places
,Make it seem like it's been ages
,Tomorrow's sun with buildings scraping skies
,I love this country dearly
,I can feel the ladder clearly
,But I never thought I'd be alone to try
,Once I was outside Penn Station
,Selling red and white carnations
,We were still alone, my wife and I
,Before we marry, save my money
,Brought my dear wife over
,Now I want to bring my family state side
,But off the boat they stayed awhile
,Then scattered 'cross the coast
,Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

,Practice isn't perfect
,But the market cuts its loss
,I remind myself that times could be much worse
,My wife won't ask me questions
,There's not so much to ask
,And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
,Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
,Then decided she will stay the rest of her life
,I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
,And sit and pray they never feel my strife
,But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
,He made some bad investments
,Now the accounts are overdrawn
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
,Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)

,And tomorrow you'll cook dinner
,For the neighbors and their kids
,We can rip apart the socialists
,and all their damn taxes
,You'll see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees
,I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need
,I took a walk
,Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

, But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
, When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
, Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
,
, When the world is callin' out your name, begging you to fight
, Pick yourself up once more
, Pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die

,Here we stand, open arms
,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change
,
,Summer in the hills
,Those hazy days I do remember
,We were running still
,Had the whole world at our feet
,Watching seasons change
,Our roads were lined with adventure
,Mountains in the way
,Couldn't keep us from the sea
,
,Here we stand open arms
,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change

,It starts with one thing
,I don't know why
,It doesn't even matter
,How hard you try
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme
,To explain in due time
,All I know
,Time is a valuable thing
,Watch it fly by
,As the pendulum swings
,Watch it count down
,To the end of the day
,The clock ticks life away
,It's so unreal
,Didn't look out below
,Watch the time go
,Right out the window
,Trying to hold on,
,But didn't even know
,Wasted it all just
,To watch you go
,I kept everything inside and
,Even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,One thing,
,I don't know why
,It doesn’t even matter
,How hard you try,
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme,
,To remind myself how
,I tried so hard
,In spite of the way
,You were mocking me
,Acting like I was
,Part of your property
,Remembering all the
,Times you fought with me
,I'm surprised it got so (far)
,Things aren't the way
,They were before
,You wouldn't even
,Recognise me anymore
,Not that you
,Knew me back then
,But it all comes
,Back to me (in the end)
,You kept everything inside
,And even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when I
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I've put my trust in you
,Pushed as far as I can go
,For all this
,There's only one thing you should know
,I've put my trust in you
,Pushed as far as I can go
,For all this
,There's only one thing you should know
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end

,I've been reading books of old
,The legends and the myths
,Achilles and his gold
,Hercules and his gifts
,Spiderman's control
,And Batman with his fists
,And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
,But she said, where'd you wanna go?
,How much you wanna risk?
,I'm not looking for somebody
,With some superhuman gifts
,Some superhero
,Some fairytale bliss
,Just something I can turn to
,Somebody I can kiss
,I want something just like this

,I've been reading books of old
,The legends and the myths
,The testaments they told
,The moon and its eclipse
,And Superman unrolls
,A suit before he lifts
,But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
,She said, where'd you wanna go?
,How much you wanna risk?

作词 : Franklin, Pittman
Verse one：
I wake up to another day of life and wish i didnt
Cuz my records predicted a future of bill clinton
But i continue to do my thang to make a livin
Fuck the police and judge brennan cuz i aint givin in
I'm cops so say the notorious killa
Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga
Smokin' lye with an unidentified man
The feds believe it was a member of the clan
A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious
Fuck wit delores im bringin 50 crime bosses
From bk to jersey niggaz wanna murder me
Aint nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army
Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz
End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh
1 - makin green for the next man
Money ?strugglin plans for the dividends
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
(repeat)
Verse two:
Same shit different day i scheme to make the paper
God dreams of livin large makin niggaz steal and rob
Fuck the pleadin ill leave ya bleedin
If ya take to long deliverin
Dividends, see nigga, im menances like 8 sharp
Cracks on my moms china plate
Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate
Keep my eyes open cuz po po they be keepin
They tryin to get locked on friday and spend the weekend
Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin
So when im in the four buildin im hollerin staten island
With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th
The first nigga to fake a move is gettin phillied with the quickness
I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life
It's a cut throat bi with mens who live trife
You squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death)
I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left
And let's go to war i got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's
Straight from haiti, ill turn a nigga into gravy
And fuck the media ? ? put this on the news
Cause its so safe to know the notorious rulz
Repeat 1

,bang on another song I’mma have these niggas nervous
,And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
,Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
,Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
,And I shit on these males ‘til it's stinkin' fouler than a weed smell
,Nigga your tree fell

,Talking, I’m sick and I got them shook and I bang em at retail
,Until they cripple, see I cook like I’m slanging a weed sale
,Until I triple bread and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
,Oh see well, these niggas already know
,The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
,The case is shut
,Your bitch remind me of my replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
,It's going down like she was a basement fuck

,So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
,Ragdolling these niggas and attack them like apes in the cut
,I’m waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet

,It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
,And drinking ‘til I’m blasted harassing

,And I been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
,Naw, but the beat is fried!
,Apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
,It just might make you sick
,So irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
,Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit
,Narrow minded, but go through such a wide range of this emotion
,That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
,I just pulled up in Clive Davis' driveway
,With his personal memoir saying he's bi
,Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
,Making him cry "rape" then arrive naked
,And drive straight through the gay pride parade, yippee-Ki-Yay
,Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
,And should I take it as a sign?
,Maybe to take 'em back into time (Shady)
,I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger
,To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
,Changed the whole complexion of the game
,But just in case you was thinking
,An inkling of replacing the kingpin
,Of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
,So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
,You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
,Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
,That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen and
,Who raps nasally, eyes hazelly, rhymes crazily
,But sounds like he may need some Flonase when he's speaking?
,What kind of stupid question is that?
,Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln
,Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
,How'd you think that play was this weekend?
,You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
,See me on a ballot? I'm running for class clown
,Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just a candidate
,To come fuck up the whole party
,Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
,To have every campus on a fucking rampage
,Act my goddamn age? I am eight
,So let's get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed
,covered in Band-Aids
,Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades
,But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
,Shady for president, ho
,Don't make me go take it back to the days of old
,Where Sway & Tech radio when I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
,I almost fell asleep on the wake up show
,Fuck you telling me, fools?
,I was rippin' shop raisin' hell up in Drew's
,When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
,Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
,You're fucking with vets dawg, fucking internet bloggers
,"I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
,Everything, I'm an expert on everything
,everything sucks, play the next song"
,Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
,With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you
,I'd be dead wrong
,Son of God I'm the S.O.G. like a wet log
,pores never get clogged
,I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
,Yes, yes y’all, steady on the left, y’all
,Step off 'forr you get stepped on, soft?
,Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
,Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
,I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
,Alert, alert, girl, alert
,Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt, so
,Jump around, jump, jump, get that ass shaking
,Jump around, jump, came to hit you with a fan favorite
,But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
,and freaking hands flailing
,And jump like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind
,More afraid of success than I am of failure
,So what does that tell ya?
,That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
,Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
,Before he ran straight into the damn railing
,Chill, man, chill

,I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
,Mentally sinkin' 'specially brinkin'
,Two decades and a half making a path for mine to follow
,The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap, prepared to gamble
,I give you half of chiseled pencil
,What's the come up, cried a ton of tears, drunk a ton of beers

,Was super bad and what not
,But he was the kinda fella to follow paths that was hot

,Like he a hog creepin' through the smog
,Smokin' on some Indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
,Like most who come to this West Coast society
,Tried to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
,So what a relic way to end this, got rolled up
,When he was strolling on a Sunday after tennis
,Niggas never listen, they gotta learn their lesson
,The hard way I'm guessin', guessin'
,BD as I hit the B and make a right on Weston

Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin back

Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow

,You got to close your eyes and let them fly, you got to
,Drink your tears and sing your fears
,Listen to the rumble over rain
,And as the flames burned down
,We ran ourselves to hide
,And heard the words they cried:
,He-e-ey
,Don’t you run don’t you move until they see
,He-e-ey
,We’re made of dust and ivory
,Sun’s off
,A child asleep
,Swings the ashes to the sea
,Will they
,Remember me
,As the creatures live on peacefully

,Drink your tears and sing your fears

,君と歩く夜を幾つ数えてたんだろう
,近づいて離れていく
,曖昧な距離が計れなくて
,立ち止まる事なんて考えもしなかったよ
,いつしか届かない程心離れていった
,「あっそ」で片付けられて
,もうどうにでもなれなんて
,壁殴っても痛いだけだった
,そんな事もあったっけ
,なんか笑えてきたって
,あの頃の僕らも愛しく思えてきたんだ
,人1人が生きていくだけで
,何でこんなに辛いのだろう
,共に誰かと生きていくのは
,きっと奇跡みたいな事だよ
,ある日 ある時 ある惑星で
,僕らは出会って離れただけ
,ただそれだけの事が今も
,僕の胸を突き刺してる
,子供達の帰ったあとの夜の公園に
,なんとなく感じたシンパシー
,今年も夏は終わるらしい
,君の大嫌いなこの季節に今はただ
,取り残されていたいだけ
,そこに君がいないだけ Ah
,水銀灯が場違いな
,僕をやけに照らすんだ
,恥ずかしくなって逃げ出そうとした
,そんな被害妄想も
,いつか消えていくなんて
,あの頃の僕らを無かった事にしないでよ
,人1人が生きていくだけで
,何でこんなに辛いのだろう

,Starlit faces, never look somber
,No
,Can you feel my heartbeat racing
,Memories of heartbreak fading
,I reach out these arms embracing
,You
,They don't have a love worth chasing
,We go far beyond those spaceships
,Open up your eyes you see it too
,
,You lift my spirits when you hold my hand
,Anywhere we land
,It's like our toes are in the sand
,You got my feelings set to overload
,Spilling over more
,
,Until I overflow
,
,I can’t count to one Mississippi
,Without needing you to be with me
,Life's so complex, all I want is me and you
,Can you feel my heartbeat racing
,Memories of heartbreak fading
,I reach out these arms embracing
,You
,They don't have a love worth chasing
,We go far beyond those spaceships
,Open up your eyes you see it too
,
,You lift my spirits when you hold my hand
,Anywhere we land
,It's like our toes are in the sand
,You got my feelings set to overload
,Spilling over more
,
,Until I overflow
,
,Can explain what can't be explained
,Is it so strange to not be the same
,Never change no please never change
,Fill my soul your words set me free
,Take me wherever I wanna be
,Be my harmony

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose

,Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
,And shit I'm straight
,I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
,Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
,I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
,And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
,So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
,Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?

,This is something we erase.
,We've been chased by the tide and the waves.

,We're in the cold and uncomfortable sheets.
,In a lonely hotel room.

,我不高兴的是 没有一人用心聆听
,不高兴 这三个字我说了千百遍
,他们让我赶紧长大 得先学会改变
,渐渐 的我也开始没了朋友
,被当作异类的人呐 也或许不只是我
,我讨厌现在的规则 想回到小时候
,没有察言和观色 情绪也没隐藏过
,可是时过境迁 只能走走走走
,在风中颤抖的手 又又是一年后
,没了命的拼凑 就即使关了聚光灯
,就算无法双脚落地 也仍想看黄昏
,我始终无法适应 只能够活在想象中
,你可以看看我的日记 但每一篇都是空

,一面镜子贴着贴纸镜面快要破碎
,一切静止只有时间在偷偷作祟
,心里的冬季我需要一件northface
,失去的感情不愿再问错对
,麻木了反应我早已习惯坐在
,一人的房间 冰冷的床边
,任凭怎么做也只能坐幸福的旁边
,OH MY G.O.D 忘不了she told me

,如今醉倒在房门后的我想问问你
,是不是没有星的夜你也只剩自己

,打开电话不知道和谁说hey
,也许是世界太过大同我的却太冷门
,也许该大步向前不在原地等人
,也许不是孤独是天生的本能
,所以她离开了你只留下了吻痕
,还是他离开了你 却在衣柜留下风衣
,而在club摇摆的你 内心却很空虚
,成人世界很空虚 当你 喝醉等空的
,才发现 茫茫世界好像没人能懂你

,生活依旧无法想象的艰难
,但我的初心不会被渲染
,mykeep的 flow 依旧纯天然
,所有负担都扛在我肩膀
,人生不过是场旅行
,但生命的意义在哪
,别被利益蒙蔽眼睛
,只为贪图一时的快感
,这一路上的所有磨难
,都是为我成功时做的铺垫
,适者生存弱者被吞噬
,我迟早会拿回属于我的一切
,背后的闲言碎语也不愿去争
,任凭脏口水在背后无限的喷
,当我经历黑 暗后才发现
,只有我自己才是盏不灭的灯
,My worlds torn apart ain’t nobody know
,My walls are crumbling down, now I’m letting go
,I’m stripped naked to the core alone left in the cold
,I’m losin my grip and this feelin its killin me needin that somethin to hold
,Now that the tables have turned you winnin so
,You went and sold your soul to the devil now i know
,My heart is achin and I’m faintin while you put on a show
,Now with those lies I’m losin my mind

,800分钟语音通话 通话
,耳机里传来你的梦话
,让你心理防线崩塌 崩塌
,陪你度过春秋冬夏
,让你迷恋phone sex
,babe不用节制
,你说的每句情话我都用来写词
,让你排满我的档期那我该如何反击呢
,你的每次喘息 都对我耳膜轰炸
,在加速我的心跳 频率你可以听到
,被你抓住我的心要了我的命小宇宙被引爆
,在你打给我之前我生活过得乱七八糟
,那些bitch对我来说就是打扰
,嘟.....“hello”
,My true love 欢迎你初来乍到

,拨通这段语音电话
,从没想过它会停
,听着你和我的现状
,烦恼事也就都归零
,抱着幻想和你的憧憬
,沿着夏令迈进了冬令
,时差倒转让我重新拾 起
,想说荤段子但有些不合时宜
,有时会被信号打断
,这一秒想法就是生气
,可能刚睡醒思绪有些杂乱
,话语里也惹了不少争议
,你说你那里今天天气有点冷
,我给你套上无数件隐形的外套
,从性取向聊到了外貌
,聊金曲奖到朋友的外号
,你问最近有没有我的新歌听
,写进我们对话
,我说开始工作了你先静个音
,困了就先睡吧
,开心时光总是比较短暂
,想让时间走得更加缓慢
,不知为何开始觉得反感
,说出不能抱着你睡的晚安

,故事的开始  到一半也就停止
,曾经深陷其中爱过你的样子
,嗯  我没有完成我的承诺
,也许会有些难过 留下的也不全是寂寞
,希望彼此都好过 像我们曾经吵过
,还哭过跑过 也算是爱过有过收获
,我坦然自己放下你了  没什么心酸不舍
,不用再在彼此怀疑相互猜测指责
,适可而止了 迟早要做出选择
,你也要看清我们之间注定没有转折
,你我都晓得 只剩下习惯的壳
,我真的要离开了你让我成为最好的我
,你来过 你看过 你爱过 我
,你哭过 你痛过 你摸过 我
,手里的温柔 没戳破继续感受
,你还在心里绕 我只想快走掉
,也只是在消耗  是困扰
,人群前的热闹 人背后的萧条
,倒退的时间表 就停了
,从现在开始 你一个人
,把心的窗户关上然后打开一扇门
,把回忆丢掉让他停止延伸
,停止在你的生活翻翻身边看看还有什么是真
,不知道你 是错 或者是你太懦弱
,只希望自己过得很真诚表现不做作
,也不算落魄 只是话太少比较沉默
,所以我习惯握不住你的手一个人过
,我想 我应该走掉
,应该喝下分开的解药
,当欢笑换成苦笑
,沉默背后的浮躁
,对彼此苦恼
,记得你轻咬嘴唇说着不要
,不要 又喊着继续
,对你的记忆 落在床铺点点滴滴
,不是甜甜蜜蜜 是勉强一起
,直到我们不在继续
,或许 我想我可以
,********
,你来过 你看过 你爱过 我
,你哭过 你痛过 你摸过 我
,手里的温柔 没戳破继续感受

,Verse1
,现在是凌晨三点脑海清空了你的记忆
,不知道你是否躺在他的床边叙说不能说的秘密
,那些谎言编织的画面在我脑海里加载的刚刚好
,就像对我说再见的那天陷阱我掉进的刚刚巧
,已经记不清我怎么喝到了断片
,心里仿佛划过了一道闪电
,他们总说感情需要锻炼
,事情总是有正也有反面
,所以我无止境的说服自己想要主动放下一切
,而你却用你的方式以为可以毁灭我的世界
,bitch.只是我不懂为什么我开过的玩笑再也不玩笑
,给你所有关心变成多余换来在电话里的吼叫
,我不懂怎么修补这份感情掌握基本的要领
,就连最后对你的道歉都被你变成玩弄的笑柄
,我不懂我该说些什么你才不会发火
,既然当初没有问题为何你一直在闪躲
,就连最后你离开的理由都是我亲自为你编好的借口
,冰冷的躯壳在黑夜中伴随着回忆止不住的颤抖

,没有任何的原因 你爱的足够小心
,我无法捕捉你的气息 拼凑出是你杀死我的证据
,它却成为你我的秘密 在你心里最久的秘密 永远不敢提起的秘密

,
,Verse2
,OK 过去的那些破事藏在我的心里早就已经不想提
,我为自己写好了另外一个剧情本来想让原版的变成谜
,直到黑夜将近连旁观者渐渐都把真相扎破
,我得到了痛恨交替的感觉不是单纯只有失落
,冲动再也无法得到克制 聪明的我开始变得弱智
,眼前川流不息的城市都被静止感觉像是世界末日
,到了现在说句实话真的为我之前的行为感到抱歉
,对你现在只有感谢而不是再去疯狂的抱怨
,感谢当初幸亏是你提前开了口
,从开始就觉得 我烂还能在一起生活了这么久?
,真的超级感谢你让我身边的那些假的找到借口顺便站了个队
,反正留在我的身边迟早也是有一天全部都被老子全部干废
,所以我不想说他们的思想天生就太low
,你给我制造的负面消息我当然会照单全收
,关于你的故事别人问起的时候我依然还是无法开口
,在最后我只想说我用这首还你之前欠的那首

,向谁道一句晚安都没你让我心安
,我记得你最爱的那家路边摊
,说我胖了却让老板给我加个蛋
,牵手走过繁华巷口 在彼此路口等候
,深爱着你 承诺给你生活就像那部纯爱电影
,但相爱容易相守太难 冷的咖啡懒得续杯
,转角遇见另一个TA能再开瓶伏特加
,那时我们崇尚自由却不懂享受孤独
,每当谈起爱情比书里讲的脱俗
,我知道你我曾想从青丝到白头
,也笃定爱有天意情到深处自会长相思守
,可能命中注定 这班车不到尽头
,途径彼此生命 请珍重这段旅程
,有时还是会埋冤我当初没有坚守
,但事情总是过去后才懂得回首
,那个繁华巷口 你留给我的温柔
,回忆用尽一生时光在我心里逗留
,总有那么一天我们学会和自己相处
,总有另一个TA盛装站在下个路口等候
,假如爱有天意 我们再次相遇
,走在那个街头 再笑着聊聊曾经
,angle of love,if the love is over
,love yourself forever for me
,angle of love,if the love is over
,love yourself forever for  me
,如果我没放手 多年以后
,你会怪我恨我或是感慨那句海誓山盟
,情歌寂寞太久 我害怕突然听懂
,学会那首十年 却不知道没你十年怎么走
,偶尔还是会去那家路边摊 老板照常会给我的饭里加个蛋
,好像你离开这一切也没怎么变
,这个城市这条街 还是红灯酒绿却早已失去归属
,这一路上走走停停看过不少风景
,人海茫茫之中只为找寻一个身影
,两颗真心保持坚定 对明天抱有憧憬
,可惜遇见对的人却没在对的时候
,我希望盛装出席你的婚礼 见证你一生中最幸福的场景
,那年夏天拉过钩的约定 留下最美好的回忆
,假如爱有天意

,无趣的青少年射了就走
,一个接一个的射了就走
,你安抚了十二条勃起的狗
,用春梦里挑逗小栗旬的手
,毕业于情爱的教室
,却从未找到过教堂
,你再也不精心地布置
,疲于反复搬迁的心房
,在他们的献媚里窒息
,你是所有的情话里明喻的本体
,繁复的交际 放弃了挑剔
,不自觉沉溺 谁都想吻你
,霓虹过客懒得久留
,向他们藏起你粉色的血
,我躲在角落放起音乐
,幻想你为我穿上舞鞋
,我是用下体思考的动物
,巴结了歌声粉饰了丑陋的面目
,在背地暗处安逸享受这痛苦的重复
,我从来比你卑微地投入
,在自私的维度
,有悲观的天赋
,才不善于陪护
,你火红的温度
,那tamako tamako
,告诉我今天你如何在拥抱里拥抱着孤独
