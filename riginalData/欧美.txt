喜欢他们一直聊天的样子
每个人都喜欢这惟妙的声音
但是从未有人听到我在哭泣，放声痛哭
是你让它感觉像家一样
是你让它感觉像家一样
像家一样温暖
像家一样温馨
像家一样温存
从未如此害怕失去
但也永远无法理解平静
让我回到你的怀抱吧
因为是你让它感觉像家一样
因为是你让它感觉
像家一样
像家一样
只有你只有你才做得到
只有你只有你才做得到
这也不是同一个原因

,This is not a healing song.
,We don't have to get along.
,We've been blinded in a wonderland.
,This is not a healing song.
,This is not a healing place.
,This is something we erase.
,We've been chased by the tide and the waves.
,No ending to this race.
,But now it shows to hide the key to my wicked fantasies thats are part of me.
,You're lying in a bed with me.
,But all I wanna see is if we can fantasy.
,
,This is not a healing room.
,Nor suns to see us bloom.
,We're in the cold and uncomfortable sheets.
,In a lonely hotel room.
,
,This is not a healing drink.
,It doesn't help at all to think.
,But without it you don't feel a thing.
,So I pour another drink.

,My dear

,This is not a healing love.
,It's poison in my blood
,We're the lonliest lovers around
,Now we carry hearts alone
,
,Take it slowly
,Cause it feels like time has got something to show me
,Through a crowded room look at me like you know me
,Ain't it funny how a second lasts forever
,When we're together
,
,And I might get enough one day
,But I won't let this feeling fade away
,
,I know it won't stop if we turn the love up
,What should we change?

,Away, away
,I saw the negative thoughts that were caught in the bubble
,It's usually trouble, but now I let them cover in rubble
,I'm living royal but all of these haters be wanting to rumble
,Hoping I stumble, wanting this empire to crumble
,I can't fumble
,Movin' it lucid through all hurdles
,Exclusive at all times, I'm never the new gerbil
,I'm leading like the colonel
,Coping with all the hurtful
,Knowing that in the end my patience'll be a virtue
,They late like curfew but the waves still early
,I'm knowing they don't get me, parents probably think I'm girly
,Cause of instead of a drum, my favourite noise is a whirly
,Easy to feel numb when you caught up in a worldie but
,All those April showers, on my flowers for me
,For me, for me
,I need the stars and wish that I could fly into space
,To space, to space
,And go up, up, up, up, up, up and away!
,Away, away
,Up, up, up, up, up, up and away!

,That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
,The hop is my home, rap is my grind
,I'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance
,She threw me a chance, my hands in my pants
,Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight,
,Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
,Look tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
,Wake up and write it on the pad, the pains
,Like church, the organ will invite the tears
,Like birth, the cryin' let you know I'm here
,Held by the song that gave me a name
,Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
,(There’s just a baseline) safe to inhale
,And if you're well
,Be longer years in this state, you will be
,A timeless octave to play for the tree
,That’s rooted in every single nerve in me
,The nerve of he who ignores the key
,And use it to open the minds that be free
,Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
,Beneath the clouds you allowed to see,
,In clarity, through harmony
,Someone harmin’ me?
,That won't be done
,I stand protected by the laws of fun
,I am perfected by the rhymes of Run
,Walkin' this way had the party stunned
,This music, it launched me
,With no aim, I've landed with some plane
,Where I am I can't explain or ever know
,But it's beautiful so

,Johana: Talk to me some more
,Jacques: It's hard,, I don't know what else to say. You're so far away.
,Johana: Tell me a story.
,Jacques: A story?,,
,Do you know how it is?
,Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid？
,Johana: No.
,Jacques: You go down to the bottom of the sea,,
,When the water isn't even blue anymore..
,And the sky is only a memory. and you float there, in the silence,
,And you stay there,, and you decide that you'll die for them.
,Only then do they start coming out. They come, and they greet you,,
,And they judge the love you have for them, if it's sincere, if it's pure
,They'll be with you and take you away forever..

All I heard was the sound of fish who'd drowned.
All I saw was the inside of my eyelids.
All I said fell short of reaching open ears.
Word's floating, clouding the view...
"See no, hear no, speak no evil" leave you deaf, dumb and blind, because the bad is all that you'll find.
A deeply heart-felt goodbye to the part of me that dies when I decided to put others before me, yes, my heart fell asleep -- boredom and fatigue.
I always said I wanted to die smiling, to pretend I'm at peave.
Now from my corpse beams a frigid, blank grin and once hopeful eyes are sunken in.
Like a lullaby to the cradle is the eulogy to the casket.
All my flaws swept under the table to grieve the porcelain doll that was me.
Their solemn songs sang me to sleep as my body escaped me.
Welcome down to the new world!
Happiness is being interred!
Such a shameful masquerade!
Fleeting, frozen minutes on display.
Why is evolution such a shameful thing to say?
Can you feel your bodily decay?
Arms are beside me, hands open wide.
Seems I was living my life in rewind, taking so many steps backwards, not looking behind.
Because I can sure as hell feel my brain going blank.
If my body betrays me, this pollution to thank.
This condition infects my cells like it controls my mind.
Internal army, defend me behind enemy lines!
Fragile vehicle of mine!
Don't abandon me yet!
There is so much to live for that we so easily forget.
Fascination with the fear...
The concept escapes me.
All encompassing fate... how it wrenches out hearts, torments our souls ans sings us all to sleep, to an eternal keep, no matter what beliefs, it sings us all...

, Defense?
, Listen before you convict, you see, I never did intend to ruin anything!
, Intent is a guilty conscience's white flag against pride, so I find you guilty of the crimes.
, I know, although, I don't believe, it's not only my afterlife I bereave.
, Appeals will be denied!
, The line of duty calls for an enforcement of laws, so you're our property now.
, Intelligence has failed you somehow.
, Oh, what a shame you play this game!
, Through senses, what can we explain?
, Not joy, not guilt, not pain.
, Is love the same?
, This senseless argument in vain erodes my sense of shame.
, Who's to blame?
, Thank you, Pain (for crippling my body)!

, Thank you, Pain (for freeing my brain)!
, For preventing me from returning to the source again.
, So shall it be!
, Now do you see the error of your ways?
, Of rats and men you speak, standing up tall but you are weak.

,
,With all due respect
,I don't have pity for you black niggas
,That's the way I feel
,Screamin' "Black Lives Matter"
,All the black guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
,Yellin' "Nigga this" and "Nigga that"
,Call everybody "Nigga" and get a nigga mad
,As soon as I say "Nigga" then everyone react
,And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
,Well pound that then
,Talkin' about slavery like you was around back then
,Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
,Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
,A'ight, look
,I see a black man aimin' his gun
,But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
,And I don't mean just for one day and you done
,I mean, you still trapped in a rut
,And I work my ass off and I pay my taxes for what?
,So you can keep livin' off free government assistance?
,Food stamps for your children
,But you're still tryna sell 'em
,For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter
,While you party on the road
,'Cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
,You already late
,You motherfuckas needa get your damn priorities straight
,Wait, it's like you're proud to be fake
,But you lazy as fuck and you'd rather sell drugs
,Than get a job and be straight
,And then you turn around and complain
,About the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face!
,You can't escape problems
,You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
,Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
,"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
,My voice been back
,I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
,I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy
,Got a brother and his girlfriend's black
,My head's in the cloud
,Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
,Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
,Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
,I'm not racist, and I never lie
,But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
,But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my god!
,And all you care about is rappin'
,And stuntin' and bein ratchet
,And that's the nigga within you
,Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you
,Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
,Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
,Blame it on everybody except for your own race
,Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
,And just blame it on white citizens
,Same with the vice president
,Bunch of class clowns
,Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
,How dare you try to make demands for this money?
,You gon' show us some respect
,You gon' stand for this country, nigg-er!
,I'm not racist
,I'm just prepared for this type of war
,I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
,Y'all can take that motherfucker too
,He ain't white no more
,It's like you wanna be so famous
,You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
,I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
,Pants hangin' off your ass
,You ain't got no home trainin'?
,Put your fuckin' pants up, nigga!
,Put that suit back on!
,Take that du-rag off! Take that gold out your mouth!
,Quit the pitiful stuff
,And then maybe police would stop killin' you fucks
,Yo, what the fuck?! I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But split into two floors
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story
,I wish that I knew yours
,I wish that I knew yours
,I'm not racist, I swear
,With all disrespect
,I don't really like you white motherfuckers
,That's just where I'm at
,Screaming "All Lives Matter"
,Is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
,And that's one war you'll never win
,The power in the word "Nigga" is a different sin
,We shouldn't say it but we do, and that just what it is
,But that don't mean that you can say it
,Just 'cause you got nigga friends
,Nigga, that word was originated for you to keep us under
,And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
,And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
,And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
,That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
,My grandmomma was a slave, that shit gets to me
,And you ain't got no motherfucking sympathy, you pussy nigga!
,I'm sorry you can never feel my life
,Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
,It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
,Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
,Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
,Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
,You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
,Don't talk about no motherfucking taxes
,When I ain't making no dough
,You think you know everything but you don't
,You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
,Tryna steal black culture and then make it your own, whoa
,Fuck, I'm exhausted
,I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
,I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
,All you do is false shit
,This the shit that I'm forced with
,And you don't know shit about my people
,That's what bothers you
,You don't know about no fried chicken and no barbeque
,You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
,You don't know about no 2 Chainz
,Or no Kool-Aid, you don't know!
,And even though Barack was half as black
,You hated president Obama, I know that's a fact
,You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
,And then you gave us Donald Trump
,And now it's payback for that
,I'm not racist, I never lied
,But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
,He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died
,Nigga, die nigga!
,And all you care about is money and power
,And being ugly and that's the cracker within you
,Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
,And then you teach it to your children
,Until the cycle continue
,Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
,Blame it on everybody, except for your own race
,Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
,Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent
,But, I might be any day now
,Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
,I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
,And now I'm duckin' everytime
,I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
,You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
,When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
,'Cause even though he's white
,He let us know he standin' with us
,I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
,You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
,You don't know what it's like to mind your business
,And get stopped by the cops and not know
,If you 'bout to die or not
,You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
,I love you but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
,I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
,So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
,I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But splittin' the both sides
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
,Can't erase the scars with a bandage
,I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
,Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
,I'm not racist

It kills me when you get in touch with me again, so later on you can disappear. 
Don't play around 'cause I've got someone else I've found 
I've got a life of my own 
I've got someone who's shown me 
How to live and how to give 
I've learned these lessons without you 
It's easier to forget you when I'm with her, 
She makes me feel like I used to feel. 
She takes the time to find out just what's on my mind, 
So now I'm letting you know, I've found someone who's shown me 
How to live and how to give I've learned these lessons without you. 
You don't care, you're never there, you haven't been for quite some time now. 
How to live and how to give 
I've learned these lessons without you 
You have all you want, so you disappear 
Have all you want, and you've made it clear 
Now all I want is to show you 
You have nothing 
You have all you want, so you disappear 
Have all you want, and you've made it clear 
Now all I want is to show you 
You have nothing 
You have nothing...

,Waiting here for someone
,Only yesterday we were on the run
,You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
,Now I'm waiting here for someone
,No love until you feel this rough
,Why's it only what I'm thinking of
,My shadows dancing
,Without you for the first time
,My heart is hoping
,You'll walk right in tonight
,Tell me there are things that you regret
,'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
,It's all I'm asking
,Is it too much to ask?
,Is it too much to ask?
,Someone pulled in outside
,The lights come on and down the drive
,I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
,Do you still think of me sometimes?
,No love, watch the sun coming up
,Don't it feel messed up without the love
,My shadows dancing
,Without you for the first time
,My heart is hoping
,You'll walk right in tonight
,Tell me there are things that you regret

,Such a good time
,I believe it this time
,Tuesday night
,Glazed over eyes
,Just one more pint or five
,Does it even matter anyway?
,We're dancing on tables
,And I’m off my face
,With all of my people
,And it couldn't get better they say
,We're singing 'till last call
,And it's all out of tune
,Should be laughing, but there's something wrong
,And it hits me when the lights go on
,Shit, maybe I miss you
,Just like that and I'm sober
,I'm asking myself, "Is it over?"
,Maybe I was lying when I told you
,"Everything is great
,Everything is ******* great"

,And we can't even be near the phone now
,And I can’t even be with you alone now
,Oh how shit changes

,Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
,And then you say "love baby let's go back to my flat"
,And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that

,
,I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
,I only want to hear love songs

,No fear but I think I'm falling
,I'm not proud
,But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
,No risk so I think I’m all-in
,When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb
,
,And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
,And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
,And then you say "love, this is what is all about"
,So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

Mmmhmm.. right, right
What we have here.. is a collaboration
Of the big daddy kane.. and the little daddy shane
We're gonna send this out to.. all the brothers,
And sisters, around the universe
It's a tune.. a tune about unity..
And peace amongst each other
And we're gonna have some fun, peep this
The b-to-the-i-to-the-g-to-the-d
To-the-a-to-the-d-to-the-d-to-the-y
To-the-k-to-the-a-to-the-n-to-the-e
The smooth operator's in the place to be
,
The l-to-the-i-to-the-l-to-the-d
To-the-a-to-the-d-to-the-d-to-the-y
To-the-s-to-the-h-to-the-a-n-e
The little daddy shane for the world to see
Ricky-ticky-tempo, no surrembo
Italian men, call their girls a bimbo
Puerto rican men call their girls muchacha
Ask me how i know, cause i'm a girl watcher!
,
Now i must admit that i'm a sensitive guy
Cause i cried on cooley high when cochise died
But then again at times i may be a mean fellow
Cause i didn't give a damn about the dog old yeller
But i love my brother (and i love him back)
I wish people of the world could be like that
So shake shake y'all (shake y'all) shake y'all (shake y'all)
And bust the move we make y'all
Brother, brother.. help each other * repeat 2x *
,
I'm not don pardo, or guy lombardo
I love lucy, but i'm not ricky ricardo
I'm just a teen titan, that does some mean fightin
Against any sucker mc that's seen bitin
,
I been through different world's, gave them all a try
Kadeem is my man, but jasmine's not my guy
I wonder if the kane ever dawns on lewis
It's a sin to be bad, but somebody's gotta do it
,
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust (uh-huh)
I can make a nun feel the need for lust (true)
I can make a new car start to rust (uh-huh)
And outrun the dog on the greyhound bus
,
For an mc to try to battle me freestylin
His mind must be somewhere in fantasy island
But i guarantee that by the time i'm through
I make him feel about the size of the midget tattoo
Cause i love my brother (and i love him back)
And more people of the world should be like that
So swing swing y'all (swing y'all) swing y'all (swing y'all)
Check out how we do our thing y'all
Brother, brother.. help each other * repeat 2x *
,
Rhymes that i write generate much juice
Not like dr. seuss or even mother goose
They said i was a child, but then i hit em hard
Yeah it's good to send a boy to do a man's job
,
Well i'm the biggest daddy of the macks and dons
I keep a fleet of women, probably one of them's your moms
A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the fonz
,
Well i'm a new jack from the new school, too cool
But some of the times i get bizarre (word?)
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from melle mel
And start to yell, brrrrahhhhh!
,
While i'm up on stage i feel that it's my duty
To do somethin fly, to make you shake your booty
Because i add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya, just like a bunion
But i love you shane (and i love you kane)
That's somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love y'all (love y'all) love y'all (love y'all)
Just a little bit of love y'all..
Peace!

,Said I love you so much you dirty little ---
,I LIKE it when you smack me and call me a PUNK
,And for the first time in my life, I said I feel so alive
,My whole life has changed before my very eyes
,Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
,All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there

,(We were b-bo-both...first saw you)
,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes
,And the flashback starts
,I'm standing there
,On a balcony in summer air
,See the lights
,See the party, the ball gowns
,I see you make your way through the crowd
,And say hello, little did I know
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you please don't go, and I said
,(We were b-bo-both...first saw you)
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes
,Escape this town for a little while
,Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
,And my daddy said: "Stay away from Juliet"
,But you were everything to me
,I was begging you please don't go and I said
,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story baby just say yes
,Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
,This love is difficult, but it's real
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
,It's a love story baby just say yes
,Oh, oh
,(We were b-bo-both...first saw you)
,I got tired of waiting
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
,Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
,I keep waiting for you but you never come
,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
,And said: "Marry me Juliet
,You'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
,It's a love story baby just say yes"
,Oh, oh
,Oh, oh
,Because we were both young when I first saw you
,
,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
,Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in

,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in

,Looking at it now
,Last December
,We were built to fall apart
,Then fall back together
,Your necklace hanging from my neck
,The night we couldn’t quite forget
,When we decided
,To move the furniture so we could dance
,Baby, like we stood a chance
,Two paper airplanes flying, flying…
,And I remember thinking

,Oh, I remember..
,Oh, I remember..
,
,Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
,Twenty stitches in a hospital room
,When you started crying
,Baby, I did too
,But when the sun came up
,I was looking at you
,Remember when we couldn’t take the heat
,I walked out, I said “I’m setting you free”
,But the monsters turned out to be just trees
,When the sun came up
,You were looking at me.
,You were looking at me… Oh
,You were looking at me.
,I remember.
,You were looking at me
,I remember..
,Oh, I remember..

,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,
,Ever thought about losing it
,When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
,You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you do for rent
,And the grass so green on the other side
,Make a nigga wanna run staight through the fence
,We're never freezed by two hundred times
,But still can't find no food in it
,That's foolishness
,And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
,And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
,How much that cost?
,Cause it even really matter?
,Cause the flight is a uphill battle
,But y'all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
,In the same boat, with the same ol' battle
,Why so shallow? I'm just asking
,What's the pattern setting madness
,Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
,Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
,But if it's all for one, and one for all
,Then maybe one day, we all can rock
,Do it one time for the underdogs
,Sincerely yours, from one of yours
,
,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,
,I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
,You just wanna live, been levitating so low
,That you could drown in a bubble
,That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
,For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
,To every single time that they play this song
,You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
,When the tides get too high
,And the sea upon your knees get so deep
,And you feel like you're just another person
,Getting lost in the crowd, where your partner, no please
,Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
,But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
,And even though we always a chance to us
,These are the things that've molded us
,And if life hadn't chosen us
,Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
,Cause if it was up to me, i'd make a new blueprint
,Feel better from the ground up, hey
,But if it's all for one, and one for all
,Then maybe one day, we all can rock
,Do it one time for the underdogs
,From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all
,
,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,
,
,We are alone with our changing minds
,We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
,And I never saw you coming
,And I'll never be the same
,You come around and the armor falls
,Pierce the room like a cannonball
,Now all we know... Is don't let go
,We are alone just you and me
,Up in your room, and our slates are clean
,Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
,So you were never a saint
,And I've loved in shades of wrong
,We learn to live with the pain
,Mosaic broken hearts
,But this love is brave and wild
,And I never saw you coming
,And I'll never be the same
,This is a state of grace
,This is the worthwhile fight
,Love is a Ruthless game
,Unless you play it good and right
,These are the hands of fate
,You're my Achilles heel
,This is the golden age of something good and right and real
,And I'll never be the same
,And I never saw you coming
,And I'll never be the same
,This is a state of grace
,This is the worthwhile fight
,Love is a ruthless game
,Unless you play it good and right

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
,Somebody that you used to know
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,you didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,somebody I used to know
,
,I, oh I, oh I
,I, so high, so high
,Oh, angel sent from up above
,You know you make my world light up
,When I was down, when I was hurt
,You came to lift me up
,Life is a drink, and love's a drug
,Oh, now I think I must be miles up
,When I was a river, dried up
,You came to rain a flood
,I, oh, I, oh
,Got me feeling drunk and high
,So high, so high
,I, oh, I, oh, I, oh
,Now I'm feeling drunk and high
,So high, so high
,
,Oh, angel sent from up above
,I feel it coursing through my blood
,Life is a drink, your love's about
,To make the stars come out
,Drink for me, drink for me
,Pour on a symphony
,When I'm low, low, low, low
,I, oh I, oh I

,Get along with the voices inside of my head
,You're trying to save me
,Stop holding your breath
,And you think I'm crazy
,Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
,I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
,Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey
,Wanted to receive attention for my music
,Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
,For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
,Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
,When I blew; see, but it was confusing
,'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
,Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
,Hit the lottery, oh wee
,But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
,It was like winning a used mink
,Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
,I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
,Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
,But I'm actually weirder than you think
,'Cause I'm

,Well,that's not fair
,Well, that's not fair
,Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
,To seize the moment and don't squander it
,'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
,So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
,(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
,No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
,I think it went wandering off down yonder and stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
,'Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
,And save me from myself and all this conflict
,'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
,My OCD's conking me in the head
,Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
,I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
,Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

,Stop holding your breath
,And you think I'm crazy
,Yeah, you think I'm crazy
,Well, that's not fair
,Well, that's not fair
,Call me crazy but I have this vision
,One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
,But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
,MC's, blood get spilled and I'll
,Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
,Give every kid who got played that
,Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
,To the kids who played him
,I ain't here to save the fucking children
,But if one kid out of a hundred million
,Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
,It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
,In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
,Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
,Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
,I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
,It's nothing, I'm still friends with the

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off the law, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
,I'm superman with the wind at his back
,Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
,Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
,You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pain
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eye ball
,Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,Anywhere you are, I am near
,Anywhere you go, I'll be there
,Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see
,How every single promise I keep
,Cause what kind of guy would I be
,If I was to leave when you need me most
,What are words
,If you really don't mean them
,When you say them
,What are words
,If they're only for good times
,Then they don't
,When it's love
,Yeah, you say them out-loud those words
,They never go away
,They live on, even when we're gone
,And I know an angel was sent just for me
,And I know I'm meant to be where I am

,It's like solitary confinement, just need someone to hold
,I'm not as brave as I'm portrayed, I need to be told to be bold
,Comin' in hot, I'm alone, no support
,Packed my bags, said hello to the airport
,I hope they board up my room and keep it empty
,Because fillin' my space ain't that damn easy

,Gunna miss my friends and my family
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Grabbing ahold of my memories, tucking away them away in my pocket
,I'll be the holder of the key to heart shaped locket
,Now I know the pain remains but you gotta know I'm gunna return
,I'm like a dog run away from my home but there's a trail that's been burned for me to follow
,Back to you, to your arms, to your heart, to your soul
,I'll be bleeding from the inside out through your empty hole
,I'm scared as hell, to go out on my own
,You can wait by the door, by the window, until the day I come home
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane

,Keep your feet on your track
,I'll keep my mind in line with the time
,And we'll be happy, living together and free in the blink of an eye
,I'm as content as I've ever been
,Not trippin' or slippin'
,I've been livin' life to the fullest, it's love I've been grippin'
,It's so strong I could leave for years and come back
,And nothing will have changed, except I'll be on your track
,Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
,I tried to be chill,
,but you're so hot that I melted
,I fell right through the cracks
,Now I'm trying to get back
,Before the cool done run out
,I'll be giving it my bestest
,And nothing's gonna stop me
,but divine intervention.
,I reckon, it's again my turn
,
,To win some or learn some.
,But I won't hesitate

,scooch on over closer, dear
,And I will nibble your ear
,So do you want to come
,wo-wo-wo-wo
,I've been spending way too long
,checking my tongue in the mirror
,And bending over backwards just to
,try to see it clearer
,But my breath fogged up the glass
,And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
,I guess what I'll be saying
,is there ain't no better reason
,To rid yourself of vanities and
,just go with the seasons.
,It's what we aim to do.
,Our name is our virtue.
,But I won't hesitate
,No more, no more.

(with Tinie Tempah)
She says she likes my watch, but she wants Steve’s AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
She said she loves my songs, she bought my mp3
And so I put her number in my Bold BB
I got a black BM, She got a white TT
She wanna see what’s hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her wear suspenders and some PVC
And then I’ll film it all up on my JVC
Uhh, scene one. Everybody get in your positions.
Pay attention, and listen.
We’re tryna get this all in one take, so lets try and make that happen.
Take one, action!
She pose for FHM, She like my Black LV
We spinnin’ LPR, up on my APC
I’m in my PRPS and my Nike SB’s
Ravin’ with SHM, London to NYC
I got my Lisa and My Visa
A diva and her dealer
Bitch I’m up on the guest list with the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies, and it ain't fucking Easter
I wake up in the morning with a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl like Lindsey Lohan, Queen Latifah
If you niggaz are pulling, then boy I must be fifa
And that’s standard procedure from Miami to Ibiza

,On apartment floors
,Took our broken hearts
,Put them in a drawer

,See my confidence is shaking

,You say "I can fix the broken in your heart

,
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,Yeah, Fort Minor, M. Shinoda
,Styles of Beyond, Ryu, Takbir

,You said why am I holding on baby ooh

,For all the times that you rained on my parade
,And all the clubs you get in using my name
,You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
,You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
,And I didn't wanna write a song
,Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
,I don't but, you still hit my phone up
,And baby I'll be movin' on
,And I think it should be somethin'
,That I don't wanna hold back
,Maybe you should know that
,My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
,And I never like to admit that I was wrong
,And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
,And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
,Cause if you like the way you look that much
,Oh baby you should go and love yourself
,And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
,You should go and love yourself
,But when you told me that you hated my friends
,The only problem was with you and not them
,And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
,And tried to make me forget where I came from

,To tell the truth you know I have been hurting all along,
,Someway let me know, you want me girl.
,Everytime you see me what do you see?

,How does a moment last forever
,How can a story never die
,It is love we must hold onto
,Never easy but we try
,Sometimes our happiness is captured
,Somehow our time and place stand still
,Love lives on inside our hearts and always will
,Minutes turn to hours days to years and gone
,But when all else has been forgotten
,Still our song lives on
,Maybe some moments weren't so perfect
,Maybe some memories not so sweet
,But we have to know some bad times
,Or our lives are incomplete
,Then when our shadows overtake us
,Just when we feel our hope is gone
,We'll hear our song and know once more
,Our love lives on
,
,How does a moment last forever
,How does our happiness endure
,Through the darkest of our troubles
,Love is beauty love is pure
,Love pays no mind to desolation
,It flows like a river through the soul
,Protects perceives and perseveres
,And makes us whole
,Minutes turn to hours days to years then gone
,But when all else has been forgotten
,Still our song lives on
,How does a moment last forever
,When our song lives on

,Love knows
,Love grows
,Bigger than before
,In your heart
,there's always more

,我一路看过千山和万水
,我的脚踏遍天南和地北
,日晒或是风吹 我都无所谓
,路边那朵蔷薇 鲜红的纯粹
,关掉了手机管他谁是谁
,不要去理会是是与非非
,天亮走到天黑 从不觉疲惫
,黄昏中的堡垒 多颓废
,如果迎着风就飞
,俯瞰这世界有多美
,让烦恼都灰飞
,别去理会自我藉慰
,如果还有梦就追
,至少不会遗憾后悔
,迎着光勇敢追
,远走高飞 说走就走一回
,
,翻过了山坡又踏过了水
,跟心走别管东南和西北
,前行或是后退 靠直觉发挥
,日落下的余晖 有一点凄美
,拥挤的城市布满了虚伪
,何必去辩解谁错或是对
,就让一切回归 童真的滋味

,Because listen to me, listen to me
,I got news for you - I wish to God that you had!
,
,I guess I've seen everything now.
,You sit there packing your big cigars,
,And think of deliberately killing an idea
,That's made millions of people a little bit happier.
,An idea that has brought thousands of
,Them here from all over the country.
,By bus, by freight and jalopies and on foot!
,So they could pass on to each other
,Their own simple little experiences.
,Why, look, I'm just a mug and I know it.
,Why your types are as old as history.
,If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea,
,And twist it and squeeze it
,And stuff it into your own pocket,
,You slap it down! Like dogs!
,If you can't eat something you bury it!
,Why this is the one worthwhile thing that's come along.
,People are finally finding out that
,The guy next door isn't the bad egg.
,Simple isn't it?
,Yet a thing like that has got a chance of spreading
,Until it touches every last doggone human being in the world
,And you talk about killing it.
,Or when this fire dies down,
,What's going to be left?
,More misery, more hunger and more hate.
,And what's to prevent that from starting all over again?
,Nobody knows the answer to that one, and certainly not you,
,With the slimy bollocks ideas you've got.
,The John Doe idea may be the answer though.
,It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world!
,Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks
,And tell me kill it if you can't use it.
,You go ahead and try.
,You couldn't do it in a milion years with
,All your radio stations and all your power
,Because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake,
,It's bigger than your ambitions and
,It's bigger than all the bracelets and fur coats in the world.

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,I was left to my own devices
,Many days fell away with nothing to show
,And the walls kept tumbling down
,In the city that we love
,Great clouds roll over the hills
,Bringing darkness from above
,But if you close your eyes,
,Does it almost feel like
,Nothing changed at all?
,And if you close your eyes,
,Does it almost feel like
,You've been here before?
,How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
,How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
,But if you close your eyes
,We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
,In your pose as the dust settles around us
,And the walls kept tumbling down
,In the city that we love
,Great clouds roll over the hills
,Bringing darkness from above
,But if you close your eyes,
,Does it almost feel like
,Nothing changed at all?
,And if you close your eyes,
,Does it almost feel like
,You've been here before?
,How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Turn off the light and close your eyes
It`s the night that you will dream
You feeling me you getting closer
Without knowing call on me
I imagine that both we will run
Together up in the sky
I`m missing your voice every day
And touching your lips when you cry … x2
When you cry … x3
Touching your lips when you cry …
When you cry … x3

,На расстоянии я не увижу.
,Но я пытаюсь всё изменить.
,Где-то ответы, но задыхаюсь.
,Нашу любовь мне не переплыть.
,Еще один день и я не закричала.
,На рассвете, что нет тебя.
,Но еще один день и я знаю причалы.
,Падали падали к звездам.
,Может быть, может быть поздно.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Надо ли, надо ли, это прячется, прячется где-то.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Падали падали к звездам.
,Может быть, может быть поздно.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Надо ли, надо ли, это прячется, прячется где-то.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Моя любовь...(x3)
,И без касания я всё услышу.
,Можно мне вечность столько любить.
,Рядом с тобою я всегда тише.
,Я так хотела все повторить.
,Еще одна ночь и я просто молчала.
,На закате тебя любя.
,Но еще одна ночь и я не понимала.
,Падали падали к звездам.
,Может быть, может быть поздно.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Надо ли, надо ли, это прячется, прячется где-то.
,Сломана, сломана к тебе моя любовь.
,Падали падали к звездам.
,Может быть, может быть поздно.

,Моя любовь...(x4)

,The club isn't the best place to find a lover
,So the bar is where I go
,Me and my friends at the table doing shots
,Drinking faster and then we talk slow
,You come over and start up a conversation with just me
,And trust me I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
,
,Girl, you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,I may be crazy, don't mind me, say

,One week in we let the story begin
,We're going out on our first date
,But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
,Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
,We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
,And how your family is doin' okay
,And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
,Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
,

,Loving can hurt
,Loving can hurt sometimes
,But it's the only thing
,That I know
,And when it gets hard
,You know it can get hard sometimes
,It is the only thing makes us feel alive
,We keep this love in a photograph
,We make these memories for ourselves
,Where our eyes are never closing
,Hearts are never broken
,And time's forever frozen still
,So you can keep me
,Inside the pocket
,Of your ripped jeans
,Holdin' me closer
,Till our eyes meet
,You won't ever be alone
,Wait for me to come home
,
,Loving can heal
,Loving can mend your soul

,We were staying in Paris
,To get away from your parents
,And I thought, “Wow
,If I could take this in a shot right now
,I don't think that we could work this out”
,Out on the terrace
,I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
,Could I let you fall by yourself
,While I'm wasted with someone else?”
,If we go down then we go down together
,They'll say you could do anything
,They'll say that I was clever
,If we go down then we go down together

,To get away from your parents
,You look so proud
,Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
,Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
,Out on the terrace
,We breathe in the air of this small town
,On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
,Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in
,If we go down then we go down together
,They'll say you could do anything

,if you wanted me you would just say so
,and if i were you, i would never let me go
,i don't mean no harm
,i just miss you on my arm
,wedding bells were just alarms
,caution tape around my heart
,you ever wonder what we coulda been?
,you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
,sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
,i know that i control my thoughts, and i should stop reminiscing
,but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,when love and trust are gone
,i guess this is moving on
,everyone i do right does me wrong
,so every lonely night, i sing this song
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put
,nobody else above you
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i want you
,you want her, you need her
,and i'll never be her
,all alone i watch you watch her
,like she‘s the only girl you've ever seen
,you don't care u never did
,you don't give a damn about me
,yeah all alone i watch you watch her
,she's the only thing you've ever seen
,how is it you never notice
,that you are slowly killing me
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put
,nobody else above you
,i hate you i love you

,Train my mind so I forget
,Sink your teeth into my bones
,Dig me out then fill the hole
,Tear me apart
,Tear me apart and watch it burn
,Tear me apart
,Tear me apart and watch it burn
,All that's left is a window to my soul
,Come and get it one more time
,Come and get it one more time (whoa)
,If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
,Come and get it one more time (whoa)
,If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)
,Come and get it
,Come and get it..
,Mouth to mouth I breathe you in
,Swallow down your jagged sin
,Let it drown inside my veins
,The sweetest poison I could take
,You make it an art
,The way that you scar with every word
,But before we reach the end
,Strip me down again
,Come and get it one more time (whoa)
,If you wanna lose your mind (whoa oh)

,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see

,We were both young when I first saw you
,I closed my eyes and the flashback starts
,I'm standing there
,On a balcony in summer air
,See the lights see the party the ball gowns
,I see you make your way through the crowd
,And say hello
,Little did I know
,That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes
,Escape this town for a little while
,Oh oh
,Cause you were Romeo I was the scarlet letter
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,But you were my everything to me
,I was begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes
,Romeo save me
,They try to tell me how I feel
,This love is difficult but it's real
,Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes
,Oh oh
,I got tired of waiting
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you is fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of town
,And I said
,Romeo save me
,I've been feeling so alone
,I keep waiting for you but you never come
,Is this in my head
,I don't know what to think
,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
,And said
,Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your dad
,Go pick out a white dress
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes

,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
,Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
,Loving him is like trying to change your mind
,once you're already flying through the free fall
,Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
,Losing him was blue, like I've never known
,Missing him was dark grey, all alone
,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
,But loving him was red
,Loving him was red
,Touching him was like realizing
,All you ever wanted was right there in ront of you
,Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
,Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
,And realizing there's no right answer
,Regretting him was like wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong
,Losing him was blue, like I've never known
,Missing him was dark grey, all alone
,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
,But loving him was red
,Oh, red
,Burning red
,Remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
,Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
,But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
,Burning red
,Loving him was red
,Oh, losing him was blue, like I've never known
,Missing him was dark grey, all alone
,Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
,Cause loving him was red
,Yeah, yeah red
,Burning red

,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,Ever thought about losing it
,When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
,You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you do for rent
,And the grass so green on the other side
,Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence
,We're never freezed by two hundred times
,But still can't find no food in it
,That's foolishness
,And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look, and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
,Cause it even really matter?
,Cause the flight is a uphill battle
,But y'all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
,In the same boat, with the same ol' battle
,Why so shallow? I'm just asking
,What's the pattern setting madness
,Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
,Most of us ain't hollywood actors
,But if it's all for one, and one for all
,Then maybe one day, we all can rock
,Do it one time for the underdogs
,Sincerely yours, from one of yours
,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
,I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
,You just wanna live, been levitating so low
,That you could drown in a bubble
,That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
,For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
,To every single time that they play this song
,You can say that that's what bobby ray wrote for us
,When the tides get too high
,And the sea upon your knees get so deep
,And you feel like you're just another person
,Getting lost in the crowd, where your partner, no please
,Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
,But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
,And even though we always a chance to us
,These are the things that've molded us
,And if life hadn't chosen us
,Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
,Cause if it was up to me, i'd make a new blueprint
,Feel better from the ground up, hey
,But if it's all for one, and one for all
,Then maybe one day, we all can rock
,Do it one time for the underdogs
,From bobby ray, to all of y'all
,I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
,Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
,and I'm a house of cards
,You're the kinda reckless that should send me run
,But I kinda know that I won‘t get far
,And you stood there in front of me just
,Close enough to touch
,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
,What I was thinking of
,Drop everything now
,Meet me in the pouring rain
,Kiss me on the sidewalk

,There I was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles
,Same old tired lonely place
,Walls of insincerity
,Shifiting eyes and vancancy vanished when I saw your face
,All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
,Your eyes whispered have we met
,Across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me
,The playful conversation starts
,Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
,And it was enchanting to meet you
,All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
,This night is sparkling don`t you let it go
,I`m wonderstruck blushing all the way home
,I`ll spend forever wondering if you knew
,I was enchanted to meet you
,The lingering question kept me up
,2am who do you love
,I wonder till I`m wide awake
,Now I`m pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door
,I d open up and you would say
,It was enchanted to meet you
,All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
,This night is sparkling don`t you let it go
,I`m wonderstruck blushing all the way home
,I`ll spend forever wondering if you knew
,This night is flawless don`t you let it go
,I`m wonderstruck dancing around all alone
,I`ll spend forever wondering if you knew
,I was enchanted to meet you
,This is me praying that this was the very first page
,Not where the story line ends
,My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
,These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
,I was enchanted to meet you
,Please don`t be in love with someone else
,Please don`t have somebody waiting on you
,Please don`t be in love with someone else
,Please don`t have somebody waiting on you
,This night is sparkling don`t you let it go

,I'm so glad you made time to see me
,How's life? Tell me how's your family
,I haven't seen them in a while
,You've been good, busier than ever
,Small talk, work and the weather
,Your guard is up and I know why
,Because the last time you saw me
,is still burned in the back of your mind
,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
,Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December turn around and make it all right
,I go back to December all the time
,
,These days I haven't been sleepin
,Stayin up playing back myself leavin
,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
,Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
,I watched you laughin from the passenger side
,And realized I loved you in the fall
,And then the cold came the dark days
,when fear crept into my mind
,You gave me all your lovin all I gave you was goodbye
,
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
,Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
,
,I go back to December all the time
,
,I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
,So good to me so right
,And how you held me in your arms that September night
,
,The first time you ever saw me cry
,Maybe this is wishful thinkin
,Probably mindless dreamin
,If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
,I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
,So if the chain is on your door I understand
,
,This is me swallowing my pride standing in

,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her,
,or anyone, or anything, yeah

,I am not the kind of girl
,Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
,But you are not the kind of boy
,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
,
,I sneak in and see your friends'
,And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid'
,Somewhere back inside a room
,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
,This.. is.. surely not what you thought it would be
,I.. lose myself in a daydream
,Where I stand and say
,
,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,You need to hear me out and they said speak now
,
,Fun gestures are exchanged
,And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
,And I am hiding in the curtains
,It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
,She.. floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
,I.. know.. you wish it was me
,You wish it was me don't you?
,
,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow

,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,Your time is running out and they said speak now
,
,
,I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
,There's the silence' there's my last chance
,I stand up with shaking hands' all eyes on me
,
,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
,But I'm only looking at you
,
,I am not the kind of girl
,Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
,But you are not the kind of boy
,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
,
,So don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow

,I'll meet when I'm out of my tux at the backdoor
,Baby I didn't say my vows'
,So glad you were around
,When they said 'Speak now'
,
,
,I said remember this moment
,In the back of my mind
,The time we stood with our shaking hands
,crowds and stands went wild
,
,We were the Kings and the Queens
,And they read off our names
,The night you danced like you knew our lives
,Would never be the same
,
,You held your head like a hero
,On a history book page
,It was the end of a decade
,But the start of an age
,
,Long live the walls we crashed through
,How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
,And bring on all the pretenders
,One day we will be remembered
,
,I said remember this feeling
,I passed the pictures around
,Of all the years that we stood there
,On the side-lines wishing for right now
,
,We are the Kings and the Queens
,You trade your basevall cap for a crown
,When they gave us our trophies
,And we help them up for our town
,And the cynics were outraged
,Screaming this is absurd
,Cause for a moment a band of theives
,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
,
,Long live the walls we crashed through
,How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
,And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
,
,Long live all the mountains we moved
,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
,I was screaming long live the look on your face
,And bring on all the pretenders
,One day we will be remembered
,
,Hold on to spinning around
,Confetti falls to the ground
,May these memories break our fall
,Will you take a moment
,Promise me this
,That you'll stand by my forever
,But if God forbid fate should step in
,
,And force us into a goodbye
,If you have children some day
,When they point to the pictures
,Please tell them my name
,Tell them how the crowds went wild
,Tell them how our hope it shined
,Long live the walls we crashed through
,I had the time of my life with you
,Long, long live the walls we crashed through
,How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
,And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
,And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
,Saying long live all the mountains we moved
,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
,And long, long live, the look on your face
,And bring on all the pretenders
,One day
,We will be remembered

,You were in college working part time waiting tables
,Left to small time never looked back
,I was the flight risk with the fear of falling
,Wondering why we bothered with love if it never lasts
,I say can you believe it
,As we're lying on the couch
,The moment I can see it
,Yes! yes! I can see it now
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Flash forward and we'd been taking on the world together
,And there is a drawer of my things and your place
,You learned my secrets and you figured out why I'm got it
,You said we'd never made my parents' mistakes
,But we've got bills to pay
,We've got nothing figured out
,When it was hard to take Yes! Yes!
,This is was I thought about
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You saw me start to believe for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Woah oh oo
,And I remember that flight 2 30 am
,Everything was slipping right out of our hands
,I ran out crying and you followed me out to the street
,Braced myself for the goodbye
,cause that's all I've never known
,Then you took me by surprise
,You said I'll never leave you alone
,You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
,And everytime I look at you it's like the first time
,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
,She is the best thing that's ever been mine
,（hold on） Make it last
,（hold on ）Never turn back
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Do you believe it
,We gonna make it now
,I can see it
,Yeah yeah I can see it now
,You, with your words
,like knives and swords and weapons
,that you use against me
,You, have knocked me off my feet again,
,got me feeling like a nothing
,You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
,calling me out when I'm wounded.
,You, picking on the weaker man.
,You can take me down, with just one single blow
,But you don't know, what you don't know
,Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
,You, with your switching sides
,and your wildfire lies and your humilation
,You, have pointed out my flaws again
,as if I don't already see them
,I walk with my head down tryna block you out,
, cause I'll never impress you
,I just wanna feel okay again
,I bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold
,But the cycle ends right now, cause you can't lead me down that road
,And you don't know, what you don't know
,Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
,And I can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game
,With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
,Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing, but all you are is mean
,All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life,
,And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
,But some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
,Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?

,Last Christmas I gave you my heart
,But the very next day you gave it away
,This year to save me from tears
,I'll give it to someone special
,Once bitten and twice shy
,I keep my distance but you still catch my eye

,But the very next day you gave it away
,This year to save me from tears
,I'll give it to someone special
,A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
,I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes
,My God I thought you were someone to rely on
,Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
,A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
,A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
,Maybe this year
,Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special
,Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
,But the very next day you gave it away
,This year to save me from tears
,I'll give it to someone special

,I walked through the door with you
,The air was cold, but something about it felt like home somehow
,And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
,And you've still got it in your drawer even now
,Oh your sweet disposition
,And my wide-eyed gaze
,We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
,Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
,And I can picture it after all these days
,And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
,And it might be okay but I'm not fine at all...
,'Cause there we are again on that little town street
,You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over me
,Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
,Photo album on the counter
,Your cheeks were turning red
,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
,You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
,And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...
,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
,We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
,Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
,Maybe we got lost in translation
,Maybe I asked for too much
,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
,till you tore it all up
,Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
,So casually cruel in the name of being honest
,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
,'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well
,Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
,I'd like to be my old self again
,But I'm still trying to find it
,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
,'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
,You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well
,'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
,It was where, I was there, I remember it all too well
,Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
,Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
,It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
,
,Last night I heard my own heart beating
,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
,Six months gone and I'm still reaching
,Even though I know you're not there
,I was playing back a thousand memories baby
,Thinking bout everything we've been through
,Maybe I've been going back too much lately
,When time stood still and I had you
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You would you would if this was a movie
,Stand in the rain outside til I came out
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You could you could if you just said you're sorry
,I know that we can work it out somehow
,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
,I know people change and these things happen
,But I remember how it was back then
,Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
,Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
,Now I'm pacing down the hall
,Chasing down your street
,Flashback to the night when you said to me
,Nothings gonna change not for me and you
,Not before I knew how much I had to lose
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You would you would if this was a movie
,Stand in the rain outside til i came out
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You could you could if you just said you're sorry

,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
,If you're out there if you're somewhere if you're moving on
,I've be waiting for you ever since you've been gone
,I just want it back the way it was before
,And i just wanna see you back at my front door
,And i'd say
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You would before you said its not that easy
,Before the fight before i locked you out
,But i'd take it all back now
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You would you would if this was a movie
,Stand in the rain outside til i came out
,Come back come back come back to me like
,You could you could if you just said you're sorry

,There's something about the way
,The street looks when it's just rained
,There’s a glow off the pavement
,Walk me to the car
,And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
,In the middle of the parking lot
,Yeah
,We're driving down the road
,I wonder if you know
,I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
,But you're just so cool
,Run your hands through your hair
,Absent mindedly making me want you
,And I don't know how it gets better than this
,You take my hand and drag me head first
,Fearless
,And I don't know why when with you I dance
,In a storm in my best dress
,Fearless
,So baby drive slow
,Till we run out of road in this one horse town
,I wanna stay right here in this passenger’s seat
,You put your eyes on me
,In this moment now capture every memory
,And I don't know how it gets better than this
,You take my hand and drag me head first
,Fearless
,And I don't know why but with you I’d dance
,In a storm in my best dress
,Fearless
,Well you stood there with me in the doorway
,my hands shake
,I'm not usually this way but
,You pull me in  I’m a little more brave
,It’s the first kiss really something it’s fearless.
,And I don't know how it gets better than this
,You take my hand and drag me head first

,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there
,On a balcony in summer air
,See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
,See you make your way through the crowd and say hello
,Little did I know
,
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes
,Escape this town for a little while
,Oh, oh, oh
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,But you were everything to me, I was begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,Romeo save me , they try to tell me how it feels
,This love is difficult, but it's real
,Don't be afraid , we'll get out of this mess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,I got tired of waiting
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of town
,And I said
,Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
,I keep waiting for you but you never come
,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
,He knelt to the groud and pulled out a ring and said
,Marry me ,Juliet
,You'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,Cause we were both young when I first saw you
,I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone
,in the front seat of his car
,He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
,The other on my heart
,I look around turn the radio down
,He says baby is something wrong
,I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
,And he says
,Our song is the slamming screen door
,Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
,Cause it's late and your mama don't know
,Our song is the way you laugh
,The first date man I didn't kiss her and I should have
,And when I got home before I said amen
,Asking God if he could play it again
,I was walking up the front porch steps
,after everything that day
,Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
,And lost and thrown away
,Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed
,I almost didn't notice all the roses
,And the note that said
,Our song is the slamming screen door
,Sneakin' out late tapping on your window
,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
,Cause it's late and your mama don't know
,Our song is the way you laugh
,The first date man I didn't kiss her and I should have
,And when I got home before I said amen
,Asking God if he could play it again
,I've heard every album listened to the radio
,Waited for something to come along
,That was as good as our song
,Cause our song is the slamming screen door
,Sneaking out late tapping on his window
,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
,Cause it's late and his mama don't know
,Our song is the way he laughs
,The first date man I didn't kiss him and I could have
,And when I got home before I said amen
,Asking God if he could play it again
,I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone
,In the front seat of his car
,I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
,And I wrote down our song
, 作曲 : Taylor Swift/Max Martin/Shellback
, 作词 : Taylor Swift/Max Martin/Shellback
, Once upon a time
, A few mistakes ago
, I was in your sights
, You got me alone
, You found me
, You found me
, You found me
, I guess you didn't care
, And I guess I liked that
, And when I fell hard
, You took a step back
, Without me without me without me
, And he's long gone
, When he's next to me
, And I realize
, The blame is on me
, Cuz I knew you were trouble
, When you walked in
, So shame on me now
, Flew me to places
, I've never been
, Till you put me down oh
, I knew you were trouble
, When you walked in
, So shame on me now
, Flew me to places
, I've never been
, Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
, Oh-oh
, Trouble Trouble Trouble
, Oh-oh
, Trouble Trouble Trouble
, No apologies
, He'll never see you cry
, Pretend he doesn't know
, That he's the reason why
, You're drowning
, You're drowning
, You're drowning
, Heard you moved on
, From whispers on the street
, A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
, And now I see
, Now I see
, Now I see
, He was long gone when he met me
, And I realize the joke is on me
, I knew you were trouble
, When you walked in
, So shame on me now
, Flew me to places
, I've never been
, Till you put me down oh
, I knew you were trouble
, When you walked in
, So shame on me now
, Flew me to places
, I've never been
, Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
, Oh-oh
, Trouble Trouble Trouble
, Oh-oh
, Trouble Trouble Trouble
, And the saddest fear comes creeping in
, That you never loved me
, Or her or anyone
, Or anything yeah
, I knew you were trouble
, When you walked in

, Flew me to places

,We were both young when I first saw you
,Guess you really did it this time
,Left yourself in your war path
,Lost your balance on a tight rope
,Lost your mind trying to get it back
,
,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
,Always a bigger bed to crawl into
,Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
,And everybody believed in you
,
,It's alright, just wait and see
,Your string of lights is still bright to me
,Oh, who your are is not where you've been
,You're still an innocent
,
,Still an innocent
,
,Did some things you can't speak of
,But tonight you live it all again
,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
,If only you had seen what you know now then
,
,Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
,When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
,Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
,Before the monsters caught up to you
,
,It's alright, just wait and see
,Your string of lights is still bright to me
,Oh, who you are is not where you've been
,You're still an innocent
,It's okay, life is a tough crowd
,Thirty two and still growing up now
,Who you are is not what you did
,You're still an innocent
,
,Time turns flames to embers
,You'll have new Septembers
,Every one of us has messed up too
,Minds change like the weather
,I hope you remember
,Today is never too late to be brand new.

,You're in the car on the way to the movies
,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
,At 14 there's just so much you can't do
,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
,But don't make her drop you off around the block
,Remember that she's getting older too
,And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
,Oh darling' don't you ever grow up
,Don't you ever grow up' just stay this little
,Oh darling' don't you ever grow up
,Don't you ever grow up' it could stay this simple
,No one's ever burned you' nothing's ever left you scarred
,And even though you want to' just try to never grow up
,Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
,Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
,Remember the footsteps' remember the words said
,And all your little brother's favorite songs
,I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
,So here I am in my new apartment
,In a big city' they just dropped me off
,It's so much colder that I thought it would be
,So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
,Wish I'd never grown up
,I wish I'd never grown up
,Oh I don't wanna grow up' wish I'd never grown up
,I could still be little

,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will

,No Trespassing? Yeah, my ass!

,It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
,Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind
,I don't need no sympathy. I won't cry and whine.
,Life's my light and liberty
,And I'll shine when I wanna shine.
,Make their faces crack
,There's no turnin back.
,Let's GO!
,Well I was walkin for some time
,When I came across this sign
,Sayin who are you and where are you from?
,We don't like when visitors come.
,No Trespassing that's what it said
,At least that's what I could read.
,No Trespassing? Yeah, my ass!
,Wait till ya get a load of me!
,I ain't got BS in my bag
,That's the one thing you can believe
,My heart is gold, my body is lax
,Come on baby, can't you see?
,I don't need no GPS
,To show me where to go
,But I can turn into the North Pole
,And I'll show you what is cold
,I don't need no sympathy. I won't cry and whine.
,Life's my light and liberty
,And I'll shine when I wanna shine.

,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打

,不知抚摸的是故事 还是段心情
,也许期待的不过是 与时间为敌

,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍

,晚风吹起你鬓间的白发 抚平回忆留下的疤 你的眼中 明暗交杂 一笑生花
,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话
,我仍感叹于世界之大 也沉醉于儿时情话 不剩真假 不做挣扎 无谓笑话
,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了
,以爱之名 你还愿意吗

,Summer in the hills
,Those hazy days I do remember
,We were running still
,Had the whole world at our feet
,Watching seasons change
,Our roads were lined with adventure
,Mountains in the way
,Couldn't keep us from the sea
,Here we stand open arms
,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change
,
,
,To find, to find the exact words,
,To find the perfect words,
,To say less but to say more,
,Was ideal with this project,
,And till my energy and mind be felt,
,In a less aggressive way but a more passive
,And genius way was ideal with this album,
,To show the versatility and to show the
,To open minds in a self was the goal of this album,
,And to acquire a large amount of passion,
,And love and appreciation for myself
,Was the goal of this album;
,Loyalty to myself was the goal of this album
,So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions;
,If you are not open-minded before you listen to this album
,Open your mind.
,If you don't listen to the alternative sound
,And you've never been into the alternative sound
,And have not been open to trying different things;
,Open your mind before you listen to this album.
,You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room,
,Your car, but it can be played anywhere.
,This album is far different, far more versatile,
,Far more uplifting than the last.
,It's something you can find comfort in,
,It's very comforting but discomforting at the same time
,So, with this project, again me entering my mind
,Feeling my insanity, feeling my my genius, my energy.
,Enjoy
,
,17
,My collection of nightmares, thoughts
,And real life situations I've lived
,17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
,My own personal number
,Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
,By listening to this album, you are literally
,And I cannot stress this enough
,Literally
,Entering my mind
,And if you are not willing to accept my emotion
,And hear my words fully
,Do not listen
,I do not value your money
,I value your acceptance and loyalty
,Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
,I put my all into this
,In the hopes that it will help cure
,Or at least numb your depression
,I love you
,Thank you for listening
,Enjoy
,
,With all due respect
,I don't have pity for you black niggas
,That's the way I feel
,Screamin' "Black Lives Matter"
,All the black guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
,Yellin' "Nigga this" and "Nigga that"
,Call everybody "Nigga" and get a nigga mad
,As soon as I say "Nigga" then everyone react
,And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
,Well pound that then
,Talkin' about slavery like you was around back then
,Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
,Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
,A'ight, look
,I see a black man aimin' his gun
,But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
,And I don't mean just for one day and you done
,I mean, you still trapped in a rut
,And I work my ass off and I pay my taxes for what?
,So you can keep livin' off free government assistance?
,Food stamps for your children
,But you're still tryna sell 'em
,For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter
,While you party on the road
,'Cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
,You already late
,You motherfuckas needa get your damn priorities straight
,Wait, it's like you're proud to be fake
,But you lazy as fuck and you'd rather sell drugs
,Than get a job and be straight
,And then you turn around and complain
,About the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face!
,You can't escape problems
,You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
,Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
,"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
,My voice been back
,I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
,I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy
,Got a brother and his girlfriend's black
,My head's in the cloud
,Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
,Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
,Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
,I'm not racist, and I never lie
,But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
,But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my god!
,And all you care about is rappin'
,And stuntin' and bein ratchet
,And that's the nigga within you
,Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you
,Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
,Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
,Blame it on everybody except for your own race
,Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
,And just blame it on white citizens
,Same with the vice president
,Bunch of class clowns
,Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
,How dare you try to make demands for this money?
,You gon' show us some respect
,You gon' stand for this country, nigg-er!
,I'm not racist
,I'm just prepared for this type of war
,I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
,Y'all can take that motherfucker too
,He ain't white no more
,It's like you wanna be so famous
,You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
,I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
,Pants hangin' off your ass
,You ain't got no home trainin'?
,Put your fuckin' pants up, nigga!
,Put that suit back on!
,Take that du-rag off! Take that gold out your mouth!
,Quit the pitiful stuff
,And then maybe police would stop killin' you fucks
,Yo, what the fuck?! I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But split into two floors
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story
,I wish that I knew yours
,I wish that I knew yours
,I'm not racist, I swear
,With all disrespect
,I don't really like you white motherfuckers
,That's just where I'm at
,Screaming "All Lives Matter"
,Is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
,And that's one war you'll never win
,The power in the word "Nigga" is a different sin
,We shouldn't say it but we do, and that just what it is
,But that don't mean that you can say it
,Just 'cause you got nigga friends
,Nigga, that word was originated for you to keep us under
,And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
,And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
,And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
,That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
,My grandmomma was a slave, that shit gets to me
,And you ain't got no motherfucking sympathy, you pussy nigga!
,I'm sorry you can never feel my life
,Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
,It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
,Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
,Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
,Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
,You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
,Don't talk about no motherfucking taxes
,When I ain't making no dough
,You think you know everything but you don't
,You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
,Tryna steal black culture and then make it your own, whoa
,Fuck, I'm exhausted
,I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
,I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
,All you do is false shit
,This the shit that I'm forced with
,And you don't know shit about my people
,That's what bothers you
,You don't know about no fried chicken and no barbeque
,You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
,You don't know about no 2 Chainz
,Or no Kool-Aid, you don't know!
,And even though Barack was half as black
,You hated president Obama, I know that's a fact
,You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
,And then you gave us Donald Trump
,And now it's payback for that
,I'm not racist, I never lied
,But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
,He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died
,Nigga, die nigga!
,And all you care about is money and power
,And being ugly and that's the cracker within you
,Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
,And then you teach it to your children
,Until the cycle continue
,Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
,Blame it on everybody, except for your own race
,Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
,Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent
,But, I might be any day now
,Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
,I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
,And now I'm duckin' everytime
,I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
,You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
,When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
,'Cause even though he's white
,He let us know he standin' with us
,I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
,You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
,You don't know what it's like to mind your business
,And get stopped by the cops and not know
,If you 'bout to die or not
,You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
,I love you but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
,I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
,So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
,I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But splittin' the both sides
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
,Can't erase the scars with a bandage
,I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
,Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
,I'm not racist

,We have nothing in common, poodle
,I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
,It's me, my honesty's brutal
,But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
,For good at least once in a while
,So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
,Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
,But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
,Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
,I know there was a time where once I
,Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
,So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
,Appeal with the skin color of mine
,You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
,Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
,One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
,Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
,See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
,You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
,And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
,You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
,You're like normal, fuck being normal
,And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
,To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
,Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
,Singin' to a man while they played piano
,Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
,So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
,''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
,Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
,Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
,What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
,Innovative and I'm made of rubber
,So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
,I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
,How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
,Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
,For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
,Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
,I make elevating music, you make elevator music
,Oh, he's too mainstream
,Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
,It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
,With rock, shock rap with Doc
,Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
,I don't know how to make songs like that
,I don't know what words to use
,Let me know when it occurs to you
,While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
,It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
,How many verses I gotta murder to prove
,That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
,School flunkie, pill junky
,But look at the accolades the skills brung me
,Full of myself, but still hungry
,I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
,And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
,But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
,I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
,Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
,But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
,Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
,They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
,But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
,Then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation
,And understand the discrimation
,But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
,But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
,Don't mistake it for Satan
,It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
,And take a vacation to trip a broad
,And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
,Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?

,You claim if you get knocked by the cops
,You'll give 'em not even a statement
,Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
,Karate kick the plaintiff
,Gotti with the stainless
,I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
,If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
,On molly, had the audience sedated
,You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
,Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
,But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
,Bitch, stop bein' a lame
,Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
,Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
,And chainsawing them in the basement
,Hardly fits your job description
,Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like,
,"Oh my God, he's trippin'"
,Only time you get the blade is probably
,With the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
,Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
,I need to stop bein' debated
,You're still copyin', Xeroxing,
,I'm still coppin' a feel
,Like Bill Cosby at will,
,Popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
,Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly
,And still groggy
,This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts,
,Never sensible
,Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
,But 'til I get the President to respond
,My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
,And send it to Mitch McConnell
,Just as big of a bitch as Donald
,Shit's on, bruh
,Let me sing this shit soprano

,Ivanka, stiff arm her
,While I'm hittin' on Melania
,And this song's for all ya

,'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
,I hope you offended
,'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
,'Til everybody eats my turds
,These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
,Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
,Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
,I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
,I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
,From a daddy longleg
,And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
,Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
,I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
,With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
,Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
,Grow up? Nah
,Not that I know of, y'all
,Basement just got a frickin' overhaul,
,Got a stripper pole installed
,Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
,Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
,And go through no withdrawal
,While I get fellatio and give a facial
,To an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
,You're so appalled, so's my manager (Em)
,Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
,Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
,And nobody's close, so don't compare
,They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
,My competition can't see me
,'Cause I don't own a mirror
,But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
,I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
,Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
,Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
,But I made strides with these rape lines
,I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
,Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
,Bang, bang, bang, bang time
,Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
,You're gonna need sutures the same size
,As the blade I push into captcha
,Pull 'em like sleigh rides
,Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
,To make it on Dateline
,I came to stake my claim like a canine
,Waitin' in a buffet line
,So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
,Come play, belly dance on me
,I've been making wedding plans all day
,'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
,They want me to go eat some worms
,I hope you offended

,Eight year old with the wordplay
,Girl, take this pole like a survey
,Today wasn't my birthday
,But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
,So we're in shape
,'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
,I’m a ten, you’re an eight, like what I do before
,After, and during rape
,You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
,And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
,R. Kelly with a full bladder
,Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
,But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
,It's the same as I got in college (zero)
,But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
,I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
,Told you I'm so dirty,
,Homie you can throw me in some holy water
,With some floaties on
,And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me
,While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed
,You hope to God I don't explode,
,I gotta blow this spot up, though
,I got a lotta more
,I won't put the sugar coating on it though
,'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
,Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
,You feel like a wet pile of crap
,But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
,I get why you're tapped
,But you gotta get your fire back
,Catch fire, get upset and fire back
,Is what I tell myself
,When times get bad
,'Cause sometimes I might get sad
,Well I take the same advice I had
,And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
,Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
,'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
,I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me

,'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid
,Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
,You ain't have to have no money
,Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
,Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain,
,It's rised too high to count it
,Never asked to be rich, all I did was
,Wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
,But then I think about it and I'm enraged
,'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
,For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
,It'd be minimum wage
,But it's embedded in my head
,And if I hunted for the bread and butter
,What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
,But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat
,And blood I put up in the pen
,And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
,Or forget I was ever this incredible
,I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
,Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
,To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can
,'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
,They want me to go eat some worms
,I hope you offended
,And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
,But I'ma make you eat your words
,I hope you offended
,You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up

,The youth within our nation
,Such is a pity,
,Dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
,Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
,Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
,This has been going on for a long, long time (Why?)
,It has no place in America (Why?)
,What is vital now is a swift restoration of law (Why?)
,And order and the protection of innocent lives
,No citizen should ever fear for their safety
,And security in our society
,And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

,We forget that he's a man with a daughter and wife
,We forget that evil people never call it a night
,Tell his brothers and sisters he'll be right back and he'll miss 'em
,I wave this flag as a reminder I'm still backing this system
,
,Because I'll never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Every single time that I raise this up
,They're not fighting for themselves
,They're fighting for us
,Man I'll never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,The people here before that shed blood for me
,To show the world that freedom isn't always free
,
,They shed a tear but can't let it go though it's been years
,Since they've seen their peers facing their deepest and darkest fears
,Staring death right in the face
,Would you ever take their place
,Would you ever stand beside them
,Or do you hide behind them
,Writing to remind them
,Some out here still find them
,Guns up in the air
,We salute in a time
,When we've forgotten what it means to have to fight for our means
,We've forgotten what the powers at be can conceive
,We've forgotten what it is we're not living in a dream
,When the truth and reality isn't what it seems
,So we make our own views based on things we've never seen
,Since we've never been to battle and we've never joined the team
,They sit the sidelines point their fingers and scream
,Since they've never had to get dirty their hands are still clean
,I believe in peace plus the freedom the bring
,I hope we can wake up stop living in a dream
,
,Because I'll never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Every single time that I raise this up
,They're not fighting for themselves
,They're fighting for us
,Man I'll never forget
,Never forget
,Ever
,Never forget
,Never forget

,For the times that you took care of me when I was sick
,For the times that you provided, Lord knows we weren’t rich
,For the times I needed money and you helped me out
,For the times I was in trouble and you bailed me out
,I know that you’re not perfect, I know you’ve tried your best
,The reality is that we live in this giant mess
,And it’s only getting worse, I’m sure you can tell
,But you don’t even realize that you put me through hell
,And I don’t know what I’m doing, sometimes I think I’m ruined
,And I blame you, and I hate you, but I love you, It’s stupid
,Try not to be a victim, but I never had a system
,I only had myself for far back as I can vision
,I left home at 17, try not to sugar coat it
,But I wonder sometimes if my momma even noticed
,Did my family even care, were any of you there
,When I slept on the floor of that apartment and on the stairs
,Was so scared and embarrassed
,I knew that it’s apparent
,It’s clear I’ve got some issues
,And I blame my lack of parents
,You swear that it’s all in my head, I guess it’s crazy
,To refuse to be just like you, and want more than you gave me
,So hate me, call my phone to curse me out
,Dig up all my dirt, put it online and search it out
,Cut me with a knife, if it helps you sleep at night
,But I don’t want to fight, Mom I know it isn’t right
,
,Oh momma, just saying I love ya’
,Inside there’s so much pain
,Could you make it go away
,Oh momma, no one above ya’
,Pick me up when I am down
,Need you to hear me now
,Oh momma
,
,Momma I know you’re hearing this, it’s your oldest son
,If only things were different but decisions now are old and done
,I try to stay strong but I feel like I’m the only one
,Miss my family, brothers, cousins, I’m over run
,By the hurt and emotions, every holiday spent alone
,It’s atrocious how things unfolded, and now we can’t unfold it
,Feel like an orphan in this world, no way to change it
,I get hurt and turn away but it’s time to turn back and face it
,What happens when I have kids of my own
,And they wonder why it’s just mommy and daddy alone
,I don’t know how to change it yo’, I guess I only know
,That I can’t just walk away or just let it go
,And sometimes I get so lonely, And I just want back my family
,But damn it, it’s a fantasy, I’m canned in this calamity
,I’m stranded and I’m damned to be, the damage of your damage spree
,This hand that you have dealt me, isn’t helping, you can’t even see
,
,Momma, just saying I love ya’
,Inside there’s so much pain
,Could you make it go away
,Oh momma, no one above ya’
,Pick me up when I am down
,Need you to hear me now
,Oh momma
,
,Hush little baby, don’t you cry (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna sing, a lullaby (Mamma where are you)
,Momma’s gonna take, away the pain
,Momma’s gonna make, it go away ( I can’t find you)
,Hush little baby, don’t you cry (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna sing, a lullaby (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna take, away the pain
,Momma’s gonna make, it go away
,
,I know you had good intentions, this never was planned
,But sometimes you have to own the situation at hand
,The damage was done, I wish you knew how I feel
,And we can’t make it disappear but we can start to rebuild
,But you don’t even think that you did anything wrong
,You won’t even acknowledge the words to this song
,So I stay distant and I stay gone
,I wipe my tears, and just move on
,Momma
,
,
,
,
,
,Seems like nowadays, everybody lacks patience
,Want it right now, always sick of this waiting
,Hating on anyone, stuck in the process
,For God sakes, how long will you waste, it's non sense
,Telling you to give up on the dream, but who
,Are they to throw away, all their faith in you
,No way you're gonna fade, let them say and shoo
,Get away, 'cause what they say don't have weight with you
,You keep moving on, write that, do a song
,Right track, you belong, fight back, prove them wrong
,Yeah, just keep on, keeping on
,Yeah, 'cause this track you be on
,Right there's gotta lot of potential
,So never give up, just sharpen that pencil
,And close out all the negative talk
,Put on those old shoes and choose where you walk
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,Don't lose faith, 'cause the minute you break
,Is the minute you wake, with a million mistakes
,And a million regrets that, you'll never get back
,The time that you set back, to please other friends that
,Tell you that you can't be what you wanna be
,There's a world out there go and see what you wanna see
,I've been there, I can relate
,So let this song tell ya that it's never too late
,Wide awake, and I see more than ever
,That people are quick to give up on their endeavors
,Never really try 'cause they're scared of failure
,So, allow me to be the first to tell ya'
,I've failed more times than I've succeeded
,In the end, exactly what I needed
,To allow me to learn the right steps
,So I'd never go back, and I never regret
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,A lot of dreams get left at the wayside
,And I can feel their death in the baseline
,'Cause of something' someone once said
,At once dead,
,Won't let them stop you in your tracks, at once dead
,Say to yourself, I'ma be stronger than
,Stay up late everyday working harder than
,Keep my head focused, stick to the plan
,They say I can't but I say I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,I guess they told me, it wouldn't be easy
,It would be lonely, but only
,If I knew what would own me
,Can sew me and hold me
,Cause this game is too much for me, you know me
,I'm not the type to give up, but I'm steady slipping slowly
,Don't know where to turn, like im driving in a circle
,How do you stay running, everything is so commercial
,How do you get rid of the pain when it's so hurtful
,How do you let it go, when no one will let it go
,My past still defines me, everything is blinding
,Lights always shinning on everything behind me
,The things I don't want them to see
,I never wanted to be
,Someone who's obviously
,Struggling, juggling
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm not a perfect man, not even second close
,Music's been loving you, I probably suck at both
,I miss a date and sometimes I think I'm going crazy
,Cause I can't keep, like getting beat up
,But it doesn't faze me
,I'm cold as ice. I look around, ain't nothing nice
,They say I sew my soul, and yes infact I sewed it twice
,Threw my career into the girl of my dreams
,I weigh em both, but they still rip from the seems
,falling apart, how'd this heart get so hardened
,All in these walls have fallen
,Honestly I can acknowledge
,All this and walk with a conscience
,Cause I just tune it out, I take the foolish route
,I shut my mouth and I shout down
,You have to pull it out
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,It's like a rollercoaster, and it felt like what you wanted
,and there's no getting off it, even if you didn't want it
,I understand I'm just a man, your just a woman
,We can adapt and figure out a different plan
,But it's hard to deal dire issues, these hard issues
,When I feel like all of mine have become star tissues
,And they don't seem like they're healing
,Baggage back to the ceilling
,I see the pain and stealing
,I see the hurt and feeling
,And I don't know what to do about it all
,Guess I'm just out of it all
,Options about to fall, and drown it all
,You say I broke my promises and my vows, yeah
,I want to love you but I dont know how, yeah
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road

,Take it way way back to about 1990
,Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
,7:36am. Where a biracial baby was born
,To a black father and a white mother
,Father that wasn't there
,Addicted to crack cocaine
,Alcohol, and various other drugs
,Same as his mom
,Way, way back
,So I'm gonna tell you about that, right
,I'm gonna tell you about how
,All this young boy ever wanted was Happiness
,All he ever wanted was positivity
,All he ever wanted to do was entertain
,And this boy went through hell
,You gotta understand, his mother was racist
,Which is crazy
,Cause how in the fuck is
,You gonna have all these black babies
,With black men, but you racist
,Like bitch, that don't make sense
,But it is what it is
,You know, he grew up
,Her callin him a nigga
,The kids at school callin him a cracker
,Identifying as black, looking as white
,Being told what you can or can't be
,This kid went through everything
,He went through
,He saw narcotics in the household
,Violence, murderers, drug dealers
,He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit
,That happened to this kid
,And he persevered while the whole world said
,What they said
,Said you wouldn't be shit!
,You ain't gon be
,Nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin
,Nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin
,Nothin, nothin, nothin
,And I, and he, he said fuck that
,I'ma persevere
,And that's why the message is
,Always peace, love and positivity
,See, he always saw things from two sides
,He always saw things from two sides
,He always knew that the message
,Everybody, was born equal
,Regardless of race, religion
,Color, creed, and sexual orientation
,He knew that because he saw that
,Take it back, take it way back
,Take it way way
,Because he was stripped
,And torn down by
,His black brothers and sisters
,That were uneducated and that did not know
,And he was stripped
,And he was torn down by
,His white side that did not know
,These people that are ignorant
,That cannot see the bigger picture
,That must fight, and kill
,And murder each other
,But once again, all he ever wanted to do
,Was spread a message
,Of equality
,For every man, woman, and child
,Regardless of race, religion
,Color, creed, and sexual orientation
,Take it back, take it way back
,Take it way way back to the first
,Now imagine this child growing up
,And seeing the craziest shit
,Being a part of the craziest shit
,Running around with the wrong people
,Running around with guns
,And knives and fighting and stealing and
,And all this, because he didn't know
,He didn't know!
,But he knew deep down in his heart
,That it wasn't right
,And he knew that
,He needed to get away from it
,Now I want you to also imagine
,That at 17 years old
,This child, okay, leaves home
,And gets two jobs to support himself
,Two jobs that he works
,In the morning and the evenings
,And then he would
,Then come home to about
,8 or 9 hours of sleep
,But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of
,That working on music, persevering
,Grabbing the remote control
,And looking in the mirror
,And pretending to see thousands
,And thousands and thousands of people
,Just chanting his name
,Hoping that it would happen
,But the, but the
,But the world said No!
,Mothafucka
,Little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
,Ya nigga, ya cracka
,Ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
,No no!
,Take it back, take it way back
,Take it way way back to the first
,And he said fuck that
,He said peace, love, and positivity
,He said equality for all man
,Regardless of race, religion
,Color, creed, and sexual orientation
,Yeah
,Now I want you to also imagine people
,Telling him that he did not live this life
,You just a white boy
,You ain't never experienced that shit
,You from Gaithersburg, Maryland
,Nothing happens there
,Oh no, no, we no, we weren't there
,We didn't live with you
,We didn't live
,In your Section 8 household
,We didn't live with the narcotics
,And violence in your household
,We just saw it from the outside
,Outside, outside, outside
,Outside, outside, outside
,Outside
,And since you white
,You gotta have money, right
,Take it back, take it way back
,Take it way way back to the first black man
,And this young man persevered in spite
,Of what people told him he was
,Wasn't, would
,And would never be
,Take it back, take it way back
,Take it way way back to the first black
,And that man is here today, proud
,A lover of all human beings
,Regardless of race, religion
,Color, creed, and sexual orientation
,Yeah, yeah
,And he's here to say
,Even though we're all born and created equal
,We are not treated equally
,There's extremists on every side
,And you should just do your best to live life
,And let other people believe
,Whatever they wanna believe
,As long as they're not hurtin anybody
,You can believe they're going to hell
,You can believe it's not right
,You can believe you're superior, fine
,Just stop killing each other
,
,Yeah, yeah, uh
,I don't know what I'ma do
,I don't know where I'ma live
,'Cause it feel like
,I ain't got nothing give
,Just wanna follow my dreams
,Just wanna follow my heart

,But I'm full of hope

,I don't wanna push dope
,I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain
,Like a bullet to the brain
,Gotta play the game like a chess board
,If ya wanna go to war
,Gotta bring ya best sword
,I feel like I'm going crazy
,Like I need a psych ward
,Think my mind playing tricks on me
,Like a ghetto Boy

,In the moment I deploy
,Everybody, anybody
,Somebody fill the void

,Listen, I don't wanna work a job
,Motherfuck a 9 to 5
,Every time I get a check
,What I really get, Robbed
,Livin in America, this shit is a facade
,But you gotta push through
,And persevere, word to God
,Tryna find a home
,But I can't afford a home
,'Cause I'm 25
,And owe a hunnid grand in student loans
,Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare
,Man I swear to god
,I wish I was living in Bel Air
,Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid
,Wit' a couple bad bitches
,At the crib, gettin' laid

,Television tellin' my vision
,To get greedier
,Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain
,Operate the drive in ya mind
,Like a keychain

,I remember some how some way
,I remember some how some way
,It was December of 2015
,In sunny Los Angeles California
,In the heart of Hollywood
,I stood next to my wife
,In a line surrounded by
,Hundreds of other people
,On our way to watch Star Wars
,When suddenly I was engulfed
,With fear and panic
,As my body began to fade
,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
,But my body insisted it was in danger
,I looked around
,And I told myself I was safe, I was fine
,But I was convinced that something was wrong
,Before I knew it I felt
,As though I was going to
,Fall and fade away
,My body grew weak
,And soon enough
,I found myself in a hospital bed
,Being told what I went thru was anxiety
,I refused to believe this story
,I searched and searched for
,The cause of what had happened to me
,I began to feel detached from reality
,I felt as though
,I was seeing the world through a glass
,I got blood work done
,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
,The doctor said it was anxiety
,But how could it be anxiety
,How could anxiety
,Make me physically feel off balance
,How could anxiety make me feel
,As though I was fading from this world
,And on the brink of death
,Derealization
,The sense of being out of one's body
,I'm not here
,I'm not me
,I'm not real
,Nothing is
,Nothing but this feeling of panic
,Nobody understands
,Nobody knows the sufferings
,This physical feeling
,It can't be anxiety
,It can't
,Or can it
,Can it in fact
,Be the mind controlling the body
,Yeah, of course
,I'm so in control of my mind and my body
,But I'm subconsciously
,Forcing myself into a state
,Of self bondage entangled
,By the ropes of my own mind
,I am unhappy
,Not with life
,But with this feeling
,I am scared, I am human, I am a man
,But I look in the mirror
,And I see a child
,I am an adult who recognize grown ups
,Don't really know shit
,And they never did
,And it scares me
,Because now I'm just grown up
,Who doesn't know shit
,But one thing is I do know this feeling
,This horrible feeling is going to kill me
,No, no this feeling
,This anxiety is nothing
,I have anxiety
,Just like you, the person I wrote this for
,And together we will overcome this feeling
,We will remember despite the attacks
,And constant filling of our mind
,And body being on the edge
,That we are alive
,And any moments we have free of this feeling
,We will not take for granted
,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
,We will rejoice in this day
,That we have been given
,We will accept our anxiety
,And strive for the betterment of ourselves
,Starting with mental health
,We will accept ourselves as we are
,And we will be happy with the person
,We see in the mirror
,We will accept ourselves
,And live with anxiety

,When the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,I said when the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
,In case I'm not here tomorrow
,I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
,I'm behind on what's really important
,My mind is really distorted
,I find nothing but trouble in my life
,I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
,This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
,And last night was just another distraction
,Or a reaction of what we consider madness
,I know exactly what happened
,You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
,Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
,Like everything was alright
,And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
,Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
,As blood spilled on your hands
,My plans rather vindictive
,Everybody's a victim in my eyes
,When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
,And outside became pitch black
,A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
,I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
,That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
,In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
,I wonder if I'll ever discover
,A passion like you and recover
,The life that I knew as a young'n
,In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
,When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
,Dumb niggas like me never prosper
,Prognosis of a problem child
,I'm proud and well devoted
,This piru shit been in me forever
,So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
,And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
,Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
,And if I die before your album drop I hope -
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,I said when the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
,And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
,What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
,But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
,Just put her on blast and shit
,Judging her past and shit
,Well it's completely my future
,A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
,And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
,Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
,Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
,My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
,Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
,He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
,This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
,These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
,See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
,To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
,You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
,That's how I was taught
,Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
,And I'm exhausted
,But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
,My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
,If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
,I'll wait
,Your rebuttal a little too late
,And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
,Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
,A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
,I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
,I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
,I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
,I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
,You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
,You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
,Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...
,When the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me

,I said when the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
,Am I really scared of passing away
,If it's today I hope I hear a
,Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
,With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
,I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
,Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
,With the other side may come soon
,And if I'm doomed, may the wound
,Help me mother be blessed for many moons
,I suffer a lot
,And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
,I tie my stomach in knots
,And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
,That can come about
,Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
,Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
,Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
,And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
,And your sister's situation was the one that put me
,In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
,By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
,Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
,Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
,Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
,Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
,Fives, I count lives all on these songs
,Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
,Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
,And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
,Now am I worth it?
,Did I put enough work in?
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,I said when the lights shut off
,And it's my turn to settle down
,My main concern
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Promise that you will sing about me
,Tired of running
,Tired of hunting
,My own kind
,But retiring nothing
,Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
,Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,Dope on the corner
,Look at the coroner
,Daughter is dead
,Mother is mourning her
,Strayed bullets, AK bullets
,Resuscitation was waiting patiently
,But they couldn't, bring her back
,Who got the footage? channel 9
,Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
,When you know you're crooked
,Banana clip split his banana pudding
,I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
,I know I'm good at
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,How many sins?
,I'm running out
,How many sins?
,I lost count
,Dreams of ballin like Spalding
,But only shotty bounce
,The reaper calling
,I'm cottonmouth
,Money is power, yours is ours
,Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
,Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
,Over the city with vanity with the music louder
,The same song
,A black flower
,I'll show you how to
,Dye your thirst
,Dye your thirst
,Dye your thirst
,What are we doing?
,Who are we fooling?
,Hell is hot, fire is proven
,To burn for eternity, return of the student
,That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
,Tired of running, choirs is humming
,Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
,Now back to business, loading the guns in
,Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
,And the beef is bubbling
,It's no discussion, hereditary
,All of my cousins
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,Dying of thirst
,Too many sins
,I'm running out
,Somebody send
,Me a well for the drought
,See, all I know, is taking notes
,On taking this life for granted
,Granted, if he provoke
,My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
,My best days, I stress days
,Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
,Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
,Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
,Tired of running, tired of running
,I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
,I'm tired of tumbling
,Backwards my mama say
,"See a pastor, give me a promise
,What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
,The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
,You dying of thirst
,You dying of thirst
,So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

,It starts with one thing
,I don't know why
,It doesn't even matter
,How hard you try
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme
,To explain in due time
,All I know
,Time is a valuable thing
,Watch it fly by
,As the pendulum swings
,Watch it count down
,To the end of the day
,The clock ticks life away
,It's so unreal
,Didn't look out below
,Watch the time go
,Right out the window
,Trying to hold on,
,But didn't even know
,Wasted it all just
,To watch you go
,I kept everything inside and
,Even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,One thing,
,I don't know why
,It doesn’t even matter
,How hard you try,
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme,
,To remind myself how
,I tried so hard
,In spite of the way
,You were mocking me
,Acting like I was
,Part of your property
,Remembering all the
,Times you fought with me
,I'm surprised it got so (far)
,Things aren't the way
,They were before
,You wouldn't even
,Recognise me anymore
,Not that you
,Knew me back then
,But it all comes
,Back to me (in the end)
,You kept everything inside
,And even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when I
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I've put my trust in you
,Pushed as far as I can go
,For all this
,There's only one thing you should know
,I've put my trust in you

,It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside
,the wild wild web where there`s nothing to hide
,on the wild wild web please tell me where I`ll find
,virtual reality of your smile

,It`s a changing world that we`re living today
,
,If you need a girl there`s a very new way

,From my bottom I prefer the old fashion way
,
,When to flirt with a girl you just go for a date
,
,but all I gotta view is your mail
,so stay connected just don`t run away
,It`s a wild wild web when you feel lost inside

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off the law, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
,I'm superman with the wind at his back
,Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
,Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
,You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pain
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eye ball
,Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,
,Yeah
,I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
,But hey, what daddy always tell you?
,Straighten up little soldier
,Stiffen up that upper lip
,What you crying about?
,
,You got me
,Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
,Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
,I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
,I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
,Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
,Daddy's with you in your prayers
,No more crying, wipe them tears
,Daddy's here, no more nightmares
,We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
,Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
,Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
,We're all we got in this world
,When it spins, when it swirls
,When it whirls, when it twirls
,Two little beautiful girls
,Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
,I know it's confusing you
,Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
,I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
,The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
,All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
,Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
,We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
,But things have gotten so bad between us
,I don't see us ever being together ever again
,Like we used to be when we was teenagers
,But then of course everything always happens for a reason
,I guess it was never meant to be
,But it's just something we have no control
,over and that's what destiny is
,But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
,Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
,Now hush little baby, don't you cry
,
,Everything's gonna be alright
,Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
,We feel how we feel inside
,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
,But i promise momma's gon' be alright
,
,It's funny
,I remember back one year when daddy had no money
,Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
,And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
,Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
,I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
,Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
,But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
,And at the time every house that we lived in
,Either kept getting broke into and robbed
,Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
,Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
,Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
,And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
,Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
,On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
,And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
,And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
,And flew you and momma out to see me
,But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
,Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
,And you and Laney were to young to understand it
,Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
,I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
,Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
,Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
,Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
,To see how much you both have grown,
,it's almost like you're sisters now
,Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
,Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
,I like the sound of that, yeah
,It's got a ring to it don't it?
,Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
,
,Now hush little baby, don't you cry
,Everything's gonna be alright
,Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
,We feel how we feel inside
,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
,But i promise momma's gon' be alright
,
,Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
,And if you ask me too
,I'mma give you the world
,I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
,I'mma sing for you
,I'll do anything for you to see you smile
,And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
,I'mma break that birdies neck
,I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
,And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad （haha）

,…I am sitting  din din din……
,I am sitting in the morning
,At the diner on the corner
,I am waiting at the counter
,For the man to pour the coffee
,And he fills it only halfway
,And before I even argue
,He is looking out the window
,At somebody Coming in
,
,"It is always nice to see you"
,Says the man behind the counter
,To the woman who has come in
,She is shaking her umbrella
,And I look the other way
,As they are kissing their hellos
,I'm pretending not to see them
,Instead I pour the milk
,
,I open up the paper
,There's a story of an actor
,Who had died while he was drinking
,It was no one I had heard of
,And I'm turning to the horoscope
,And looking for the funnies
,When I'm feeling someone watching me
,And so I raise my head

,Well you only need the light when it’s burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you’ve been high when you’re feeling low
,Only hate the road when you’re missin’ home
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Staring at the bottom of your glass
,Hoping one day you’ll make a dream last
,But dreams come slow and they go so fast
,You see her when you close your eyes
,Maybe one day you’ll understand why
,Everything you touch surely dies
,But you only need the light when it’s burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you’ve been high when you’re feeling low
,Only hate the road when you’re missin’ home
,Only know you love her when you let her go

,Every time I speak your name
,Take me.. you are what I believe!
,
,
,You are what I believe
,I'll live and die for you
,This is all that I need
,When nothing is real you are my truth
,In the darkness you shine
,Can you keep me safe tonight?
,When I'm down on my knees
,You are what I believe!

,the spell was creating strange games of light
,thanks to hidden mirrors i found my lost way
,over the stones i reached the place it was a secret cave
,in a long bloody battle that prophecies told
,the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
,
,for the king for the land for the mountains
,for the green valleys where dragons fly
,for the glory the power to win the black lord
,i will search for the emerald sword

,could have the honor to be kissed by the sun

,What you see is never
,And we both know
,The sky is the limit and I'm afraid it's falling down

,In this big panorama of lies, which we came to call life
,I'm rubbing everything to find, to find that genie inside
,A state of not caring for my thoughtless wrongdoings （
,Cause I know by the end of the day there's no punishment divine
,Don't you dare to read my mind
,Because you don't like, won't like what you'll find

,Drei, zwei, eins, los
,Ich hab es schon als Kind geglaubt
,Und breite meine Flügel aus
,Die Schwerkraft wollte ich besiegen
,Ich hab geträumt, ich könnte fliegen
,Ich bin zum großen Sprung bereit
,Und zähl hinunter bis auf Eins
,Ich streck sie aus, meine Flügel
,Und spring vom höchsten Punkt der Welt
,Ich hab geträumt, ich kann fliegen
,Und dass der Wind mich einmal trägt
,Drei, zwei, eins
,Ich schmiede mir ein Fluggerät
,Das mich in den Himmel trägt
,Ich spür die Zeit, wie sie mich schiebt
,Wenn unter mir der Abgrund liegt
,Am Gipfelrand im Sonnenschein
,Zähl ich hinunter bis auf Eins
,Ich streck sie aus, meine Flügel
,Und spring vom höchsten Punkt der Welt
,Ich hab geträumt, ich kann fliegen
,Und dass der Wind mich einmal trägt
,Ich lass mich fallen, hinunter in das nichts
,Losgelöst von allem, was mich umgibt
,Ich streck die Arme im weiten Federkleid
,Und zähl hinunter, hinunter bis auf Eins

,We would walk on the sidewalk
,Innocent, remember?
,All we did was care for each other
,But the night was warm
,We were bold and young
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,What will we do when we get old?
,Will we walk down the same road?
,Will you be there by my side?
,Standing strong as the waves roll over
,When the nights are long
,Longing for you to come home
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on

,Tell me what to say, don’t matter if it’s true
,I’ll say it all for you
,I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
,
,Why am I so differently wired ? Am I a martian ?
,What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
,Because I belong in this world
,That’s why I’m scoffing at authority, defying often
,Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
,So I’m non complying at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
,
,And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
,Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
,
,Thinking he can try and solve them
,I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
,And in the front drive talking to myself
,Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
,
,Trying not to be noticed because I’m crying and sobbing
,I had a bad day at school so I ain’t talking
,Some cocksucker shoved me into a fvcking locker
,Because he said I eyeballed him
,And if you fall, ill get you there
,I’ll be your savior from all the wars that are fought inside your world
,
,Please have faith in my words
,Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me looking overseas
,This is my legacy, legacy legacy, legacy
,I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
,
,Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?
,‘Cuz sporadic as my thoughts come, it’s mind boggling
,‘Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it’s small shit
,Bothers me but now my father, he said Sayonara, then split but I don’t give a shit.
,
,I’m fine along as theirs batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
,
,Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
,I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment complex on a ten speed which
,
,
,I’ve acquired parts I found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it,
,
,Headphones on straight ahead and kids try to start shit,
,But if this all there is for me Life offers
,Why bother even try and put up a fight It's nonsense
,But i think a lightbulb just lit up in my conscience
,What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
,They are kinda giving me confidence
,Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
,Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
,
,Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
,
,Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
,Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
,
,I could be iconic, and my conquest is
,Word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest ...
,Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me looking overseas
,This is my legacy, legacy legacy, legacy
,I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is falling
,
,Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
,Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
,Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
,And use my enemy's words as strength
,To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
,Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
,By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
,Now you shut up bitch I am talking
,Thought I was full of horseshit and now
,You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
,Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
,Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
,So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
,It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
,Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers
,You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
,With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
,You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
,Suck a dick The day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
,And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
,The most high exalting and I ain't halting
,Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
,The best part about me is I am not you
,I am me I'm a fire marshall and this is my

,This one's for you and me,
,living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see
,Is a sky full of lighters
,A sky full of lighters
,By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
,I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
,If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning,
,Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh
,Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
,This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
,Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
,I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
,There is or there ever will be, disagree?
,Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
,Only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
,Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
,And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
,Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o'-shit
,Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
,You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
,I love it when I tell em shove it
,Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
,Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
,Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
,Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
,Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
,Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
,Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
,Little hussy ass fusses, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
,What difference it make?
,Whats it take, to get it through your thick skulls
,As if this aint some bullshit
,People don't usually come back this way
,From a place that was dark as I was in
,Just to get to this place
,Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
,And let it be known from this day forward
,I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
,So let em bic's raise cause I came a 5'9 but I feel like I'm 6'8
,This was for you and me, living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arms out wide I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see
,Is a sky full of lighters
,A sky full of lighters
,By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
,I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
,My daddy told me "slow down, boy, you goin to blow it"
,And I aint gotta stop the beat a minute
,To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Doctor Dre on the Chronic
,Tell him how real he is or how high I am
,Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
,I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
,So it's only right that I write till he can march right into that post office and tell em to hang it up
,Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
,I stop when I'm at the very top
,You shitted on me on your way up
,It's 'bout to be a scary drop
,Cause what goes up must come down
,You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
,Every hour, happy hour now
,Life is wacky now
,Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
,Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
,Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
,Ya'll are doomed
,I remember when T-Pain aint wanna work with me
,My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
,Cause now I'm in the Aston
,I went from having my city locked up
,To getting treated like Kwane Kipatrick
,And now I'm fantastic
,Compared to a weed high
,And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches
,on a radio and TV
,See me, we fly
,Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
,And how real is that
,I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
,Now Bruno can show his ass,
,without the MTV awards gag
,You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
,Forced to fight
,But tonight we're all right
,So hold up your lights
,Let it shine
,Cause this one's for you and me,
,living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arm's out wide I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off the law, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
,I'm superman with the wind at his back
,Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
,Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
,You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her

,I still wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why care when I'm awesome?
,Fuck what these cynics say
,Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
,And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up
,With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
,On the floor stacked against the door
,Are they just metaphors for the odds of when you comin' back again?
,Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
,And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
,If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
,And I'm not gonna be
,
,
,Here to stay
,Even when I'm gone
,When I close my eyes
,Through the passage of time
,Kings never die
,I want it, I'm coming to get it
,
,
,So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
,Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
,And I'm not stopping until I'm top again, all alone and on a throne
,Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
,Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
,And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
,Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
,Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause
,
,
,They say kings never die
,Just ask Jam Master Jay
,They just grow wings and they fly
,So, hands up, reach for the sky
,Try to hold up and prolong these moments
,Cause in a blink of an eye
,They'll be over
,
,
,Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
,And ensure that nobody's ever gonna be what you were
,So before you're leaving this Earth
,You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
,Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
,Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness, distill it with meanness
,I went from powdered milk to Purina
,To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
,To Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
,I made it to the silverscreen where Rocky's still what the theme is
,Khalil on the beat cause making the beat ain’t the same feeling to me as killing the beat
,So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
,That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
,Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
,Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
,I swear that I won't let you down
,I'mma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
,You ain't never gonna hear me say I ain't
,
,
,Here to stay
,Even when I'm gone
,When I close my eyes
,Through the passage of time
,Kings never die
,Oh, oh, oh
,Oh, oh, oh
,Kings never die
,
,Ten thousand miles up in the sky
,We never land 'cause we stay fly
,I'ma be your bitch for life
,If they try you, they gotta die

,Oh how I love how the sun lays upon us
,Staining the inches of skin
,Oh says the clouds as they whisper above us
,Oh what a life it's been
,And all of the lies we've lied
,And all of the time thats timed our lives
,How do we know whats wrong or right this time
,When all of the trees falling down to the ground and
,Fall to your knees like a child that is crawling
,All the while we never stop to smile
,Oh how she loves how the spring comes to greet her
,with lands overflowing with green
,All of the drops pulling down till they meet us
,latching themselvs onto me
,We may not have missed this time
,But then when they all run dry
,And that beautiful light that lights our eyes is gone
,What have we done?
,When all of the trees falling down to the ground and
,Fall to your knees like a child that is crawling
,All the while we never stop to stare
,Do we even care?
,When all of the tears from her eyes have collected
,Form in the sky and leave us unprotected
,I can't fathom why we say goodnight
,when we mean to say goodbye

,And maybe we can go back to the beginning
,Cause all that I wanna do is love again
,Love you again

,She speaks some night of mine
,The terrible thought
,Some night of a course of lying
,Whatever means of meaning
,And whatever cause of that
,And she speaks some nights of no one
,She sleeps some night in peril
,So echo out the profit to the term
,To the side question
,And little pain in the palm
,And she sleeps some night with no one
,Today there were strange strangers
,To make and solve this trifle
,From one ruin to another
,Now free the tail to evade the war
,Nowhere nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no
,Tonight the war’s strange for sale
,To make the lovers shouted
,From one ruin to another
,Now free the tail to evade the war
,Nowhere the nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no other, no
,For the sake of her
,Don’t you like here
,You can beat your wars, beat your wars
,And beat mine
,The moment they’ll crawl back
,You can be your wars, beat your wars

,This ship was only ever built to fall apart
,The oceans that we couldn't cross
,The London Bridge is caving in
,Cities melt into my skin
,It's looking thin
,Where my heart is there's never a home
,These wooden doors are closed and this prison's all alone
,In my glory bowing out to the crowd
,Returning to the ground
,
,Winter birth, the fires burn into the snow
,Surrender to the afterglow
,Letting mist dissolve the light
,The darkness oh it burns so bright
,I'm turning blind
,Where my heart is there's never a home
,These wooden doors are closed and this prison's all alone
,In my glory bowing out to the crowd
,Returning to the ground
,
,What a moment, encountering the dawn
,Breathing in the air I've never known
,In my glory bowing out to the crowd
,Returning to the ground
,
,My blood gets heavy when you're here
,A stone, I'm sinking when you're here
,Stacks and stacks of broken letters
,I surrender, I'll remember
,Way up high feel like forever
,Now everything gone
,My bones, they're screaming when you're here
,My bones, are nothing when you're here

,I wish that I could set her free but I'm just another man
,There's nothing I can do

,They will make him kill his people when he's older
,And late at night he calls out for his mother
,But he took her life

,He's pretending to be brave instead
,But his family's already dead
,I cover up my ears and I turn my head

,歌手：Dave Thomas Junior
,所属专辑：The Lucky Ones
,Reaching out but the past can't save you
,Wondering what all the empty souls do
,Nobody can be sure
,And if the words go around in circles
,When's the best time to stop just cut it off
,Quit searching for the cure
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,And if all this is really happening
,Look away we don't know where to begin
,Or what we're waiting for
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Holding on just holding on
,Nothing left keep moving cause
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Forgetting how to swim
,I'm forgetting how to swim
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go~

,wanna lose some gravity to float just like a cloud
,and all this time i just carry on
,i keep the faith that my time will come
,can’t fight the tide but i’m ready to jump in
,any time i’ll be all right
,oh oh i take the long way round and
,oh oh and it’s never straight or short in my life

,Alone at the station again
,The cry of the train in the night It's still
,such a long way to go
,Bags at my feet,And
,memories at my back, Oh look
,look how far I've come
,But there's still
,so many miles to go before I'm done
,So many miles beneath the moon and the sun
,So many miles, oh-oh oh-oh
,So for now
,I'm just singing here in the dark
,Starlight above me when
,it died long ago, but still
, it's bright enough to live by
,Drink deep from that well
,Breathe in while you can, babe
,This too shall fade
,But there's still
,so many miles to go before I'm done
,So many miles beneath the moon and the sun
,So many miles, oh-oh oh-oh

,I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
,I threw the day old tea from the cup
,Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
,Memories of a life that's been loved
,Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
,Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
,Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
,But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
,
,Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
,A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
,
,So I'll sing Hallelujah
,You were an angel in the shape of my mum
,When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
,Spread your wings as you go
,And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
,You're home
,
,I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
,Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
,John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
,And wiped a tear from the side of my face
,
,I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
,A life with love is a life that's been lived
,
,So I'll sing Hallelujah
,You were an angel in the shape of my mum
,When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
,Spread your wings as you go
,And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
,You're home
,
,Hallelujah
,You were an angel in the shape of my mum
,You got to see the person that I have become
,Spread you wings and I know
,That when God took you back, he said Hallelujah you're home

,I’m afraid of the space where you suffer
,Where you sit in the smoke and the burn
,I can’t handle the choke or the danger
,Of my own foolish, inadequate words
,I’ll be right outside if you need me
,Right outside
,What can I bring to your fire?
,Shall I sing while the roof is coming down?
,Can I hold you while the flames grow higher
,Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now?
,Can I come close now?
,So we left you to fight your own battle
,And you buried your hope with your faith
,’Cause you heard no song of deliverance
,There on the nights that followed the wake
,We never though to go with you
,Afraid to ask
,What can I bring to your fire?
,Shall I sing while the roof is coming down?
,Can I hold you while the flames grow higher
,Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now?
,Can I come close now?
,Lay down our plans
,Lay down the sure-fire fix
,Grief’s gonna stay awhile
,There is no cure for this
,We watch for return
,We speak what we’ve heard
,We sit together, in the burn
,What can I bring to your fire?
,Shall I sing while the roof is coming down?
,Can I hold you while the flames grow higher,
,Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now?
,Can I come close now?

,That are passing us by when we should have know it
,I was so crazy in love
,I didn't say it enough
,I didn't say it enough
,If this was My Last Song
,I wouldn't waste one lyric on what went wrong
,The melody would dance like you do
,And I would repeat the beat
,But always some new
,So baby I'm a sing this to you
,Like I only got one time
,To tell you all the things that you've done
,That make me fall so in love with you
,And it's a feeling I could never undo
,So baby Imma sing this to you
,Like this was My Last Song
,
,Like this was My Last Song
,
,If you want nothing else to close the second
,Giving all of yourself and you won't regret it
,'Cause if you're crazy in love you gotta say it enough

,That make me fall so in love with you
,And it's a feeling I could never undo
,So baby Imma sing this to you
,Oooh oh it may not be perfect
,The way you deserve it
,I'd beat out of two
,And if I only got one shot
,To say what I have not I'd sing it to you
,If this was My Last Song

,
,There will always be
,The deeper level when you think you've reached
,You think you've reached it all and then there is
,Always more
,Oh let it go
,Sometimes I really feel
,The conflict that is there and it is for real
,Between my body and in my mind I know
,Then and there is always more
,The let-go
,So I go and move my way
,Whole like every day
,Sometimes I really hear
,These voices that keep telling me to reach
,For then at least I understand that why it is
,Could be that I cannot see
,Its glory
,So I go and move my way
,Whole like every day
,But I wear this head
,For the very first time
,And I've carried my skin since I learn how to climb
,It's not the very first time my singing
,Beyond known
,So I go and move my way
,Whole just like today
,
,I never meant to wither
,I wanted to be tall
,Like a fool,left the river
,And watched my branches fall.
,Old and thirsty,i longed for the flood to come back around
,To the cactus in the valley,
,That's about to crumble down
,And wipe the mark of sadness from my face
,Show me that your love will never change
,If my yesterday is a disgrace
,Tell me that you still recall my name.
,So the storm finally found me and left me in the dark
,In the cloud around me,i don't know where you are
,If this old world goes up in arms,all i can do is stand
,And i wont fight for anyone until you move my hands.
,And wipe the mark of madness from my face
,Show me that your love will never change
,If my yesterday is a disgrace,
,Tell me that you still recall my name.
,Oh here,in this shadow;
,Here i am
,And i need someone by my side.
,It becomes so hard to stand
,And i keep trying to dry my eyes.
,Come and find me in the valley.
,And Wipe the mark of sadness from my face,
,show me that your love will never change.
,And if my yesterday is a disgrace,
,Tell me that you still recall my name.
,And wipe the mark of madness from my face
,Show me that your love will never change.
,And if my yesterday is a disgrace
,Tell me that you'll still recall my name.
,-END-
,
,
,
,Here I sit,
,With all upon my shoulder,
,Think I'd cry without a love to keep me warm.
,And I'm sure
,The faithfulness grows older,
,I'm as useful as a broken man's reward.
,And so I wait,
,But never see
,How someone so desired could fall for me.
,Well it's just one kiss,
,And it'll all crash down.
,Ignorance is bliss,
,In this cold and wet town.
,If I could bring myself to venture through
,This bold and bruised door,
,Well I might make it...
,Yeah I might make it.
,And so I try,
,With a single glance she cuts me to the bone.
,And I stand,
,Regret the things I told her;
,Because the years can teach you things days never know.
,And so I sit,
,I don't want to leave,
,I don't want to stay;
,But you tear me up
,With those insecure ways.
,Insecure ways...

,To whom it may concern,
,As a student who can support myself, I am writing to request if you can help me find a potential beneficiary of Project Hope.
,I wonder whether it is convenient for you if two things regarding the child are taken into account.

,Second, it will be better if he or she is a primary school student who was forced to drop school because of abject poverty.
,I would like to help the，recipient of my assistance annually until he graduates from college.
,Firstly, the money will cover his tuition fee and other expenses at school.
,Besides, I will correspond with him frequently so that he can seek advice whenever he needs.

,Dear Editors, I have been reading your newspaper for many years with a great enthusiasm and interest.
,It is my view that limiting the use of disposable plastic bags is of utmost significance.
,To crack this hard nut, I would like to propose several practical recommendations as follows.
,First and formost, it is imperative for us to ban the free use of disposable plastic bags.
,In addition, we should develope possible alternative forms to replace them, such as paper or clothing bags.
,Last but not least, plastic bags should be offered in a much higher price in department stores or supermarkets.
,I hope you will find the above proposals conducive and I would like to discuss this matter to further details.
,Your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express/ air dissatisfaction/ disappointment/ concern regarding accommodation. I would prefer to move into a single room next semester, as I find the present sharing arrangement inconvenient. I must explain that the reason for my dissatisfacation is my roommate's inconsiderate behavior. For one thing, his friends are constantly visiting him. For another, he regularly holds noisy parties. To solve this probem/ surmount this difficulty/ improve this situation/ crack this hard nut, I hope to draw the attention of the authorities concerned. I am sure you will agree that the only solution for me is to move into a room of my own. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could find a single room for me, preferably not in the same building but as near to the college campus as possible. Yours sincerely, Li Ming


尊敬的先生或女士： 我写信是为了表达对住宿的不满。由于我发现目前的合住很不方便，我想下学期搬到一人单间。 需要解释的是，我不满的原因是我室友不体谅的行为。首先，他的朋友经常来访。其次，他经常举办一些吵闹的聚会。 我希望引起有关部门的注意，以解决这一问题。相信您也会认同唯一的解决措施就是搬到一个属于我一个人的房间。因此，如果您可以为我找一个不在同楼，但离校园越近越好的单间，我将非常感谢。 您真诚的， 李明

Dear Xiaoqiang, I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude. I am referring to that unfortunate accident the other day, when I was knocked off my bike by a taxi. If it had not been for your timely assistance in giving me first aid, I fear that the consequences might have been much more serious. Everyone agrees that it was your quick-witted response in that emergency that has led to this satisfactory outcome. Although nowadays people in mounting numbers talk about the need to be unselfish, we see very few people practice what they preach. If there were more people like you, this world would be a much nicer place. Yours sincerely, Li Ming


亲爱的小强： 我写信是为了表达我衷心的感谢。我指的是那天我被一辆出租车从自行车上撞下来的不幸事件。 如果没有您及时为我急救，恐怕后果会更严重。大家都认为正是您在那个紧要关头的快速反应带来了令人满意的结果。 尽管现在越来越多的人谈论到大公无私的必要性，但是很少看到有人言行一致。如果有更多人像您一样，世界会更加美好。 您真诚的， 李明

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to recommend one of my best friends, Zhou Botong, for this post. With his outstanding leadership and cheerful personality, he was elected chairperson of the Student Union of Fudan University several times. Busy as he was, he completed his major, teenage psychology, with an outstanding school record. Upon graduation he was assigned to be a teacher in Fudan Middle School. What's more, he loves his job and enjoys working with children. This has won him great popularity among his students. Therefore, I do not hesitate to recommend him as an ideal candidate for the post you advertised. I am sure you will make a wise decision in hiring him. Yours truly, Li Ming


尊敬的先生或女士： 我写信是为了推荐我最好的一个朋友周伯通申请这个职位。由于他拥有杰出的领导能力和开朗的性格，他曾多次当选复旦大学学生会主席。 尽管他很忙，但他完成了自己的专业——青少年心理学，并且成绩优异。毕业之后，他被分配到复旦中学当老师。此外，他热爱自己的职业并喜欢和孩子们在一起工作。这使他深受学生欢迎。 因此，我毫不犹豫地推荐他作为您所招聘职位的理想候选人。我确信您将做出雇佣他的明智选择。 您真挚的， 李明
日期： 2008年1月20日 致： 波西. 雪莱，副总裁 自： 李明， 总裁 主题： 员工计算机培训 正如我们本周初期讨论的那样，我同意你的看法：我们公司正面临员工高比率电脑盲的问题。我们需要制定一个计划，在这个新的领域培训员工。 我想让你指定我们自己的内部计算机培训计划。我们最好把员工分类，让他们轮流参加这个项目。 写一个简要的计划，涵盖你认为这个项目需要包括的内容。假定培训为十周，每周四小时。同时假定员工在计算机方面没有任何预先的知识或没有参加过正式课程。

My dear Jack, I feel most embarrassed in referring to a rather difficult subject. I wonder if it may have slipped your memory that nearly three months ago you asked me for a loan of RMB 500. You said you woud make repayment on the next pay day. Perhaps you may make the repayment within 2 weeks. I am sure you will agree and not be offended at my request. Here is a good news for you. The Russian National Ballet Troupe, which is now on a visit in Beijing will give a performance in the National Grand Theater tomorrow evening. I am sure you will be happy to watch it.

Yours sincerely, Li Ming


亲爱的杰克： 有件麻烦事，我颇感不安。恐怕你也许忘记了三个月前向我借了500元钱。你曾许诺领到工资就归还。再有两周时间，你能还这笔钱吧。相信你会同意，不至于因我的要求而见怪。 同时告诉你一个好消息，正在北京访问的俄罗斯国家芭蕾舞团将于明晚再国家大剧院演出精彩节目，我想你会乐意观看。我给你留下一张入场券。演出7点整开始，我在剧院入口处等你。如果你来不了，请告诉我一声。 你真诚的， 李明
As is shown in the bar chart, the total production of tobacco in the world shrank from 14.364 billion pounds in 1994 to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. According to the figures given in the pie chart, tobacco consumers account for 20% of the world population. This causes great harm to us. Financially, it results in a yearly loss of 200 billion US dollars spent on cigarettes. Physically, about 3 million people on the globe die from smoking-related diseases every year. Faced with such a threat, people from all walks of life have tried various measures for a total tobacco ban. For one thing, health experts try hard to warn the public of the dangers involved. For another, the authorities have passed laws to limit tobacco production and consumption, raised tobacco taxes and prohibited smoking in public places. More importantly, the public launch campaigns to cut smoking. On the basis of the analyses above, we can predict the future tendency confidently. With the further growth in economy and more changes in life style, the tendency of tobacco consumption indicated in the table will definitely decrease in the years to come.


如柱状图所示，世界烟草总产量从1994年的143.64亿磅减少到了1995年的142亿磅。根据饼状图，吸烟人口占世界人口的20%。这给我们带来了严重的危害。经济上，每年由于吸烟损失2000亿美元。身体上，每年全球大约300万人死于与吸烟相关的疾病。 面对这种威胁，各行各业的人已经竭尽所能来全面禁烟。一方面，健康专家试图警告公众与吸烟相关的危害。另一方面，政府立法限制烟草的生产和消费，提高烟税，并且禁止在公共场所吸烟。更为重要的是，公众展开了禁烟运动。 在上述分析的基础上，我们可以充满信心地预测未来的趋势。随着经济的不断发展和生活方式的进一步改变，图表中所示的烟草消费趋势将来肯定会下降。
According to the cartoon, various kinds of promises are often seen in advertisements, department stores and even public services. Even a hen has learned how to promise. It is clear that the hen is deliberately mystifying those who are interested in the eggs she lays. In our society, many enterprises try to fool consumers in much the same way that the hen does. In the first place, shop-owners and company managers in mounting numbers make use of promises and attempt to induce consumers to purchase their goods or services. In the second place, battles of false promise-making become increasingly severe in the commercial welfare, causing great harm to the society. As far as I am concerned, all we should lay more emphasis on is what we do and how we can virtually improve the level of service. As the old saying goes, "Good wine needs no bush." Only in this way can we make people satisfied with what we do.


漫画显示，各式各样的承诺经常出现在广告、商店甚至公众服务中间。以致一只母鸡也学会了如何承诺。很明显，这只鸡正在有意迷惑那些对它所产的鸡蛋感兴趣的人们。 在我们的社会中，很多企业也跟这只鸡一样以同样的方式试图欺骗消费者。首先，越来越多的店主和公司经理们试图利用承诺引诱消费者购买其产品或服务。其次，虚假承诺的战役在商业福利中日趋激烈，给社会带来严重危害。 在我看来，我们所应重视的是做什么和如何真正提高服务水平。正如言语所说:“酒香不怕巷子深”， 只有这样才能使人们对我们的行为满意。
As is shown by the two graphs, the U.S. population soared from 2 million to 250 million from 1800 to 1990. In contrast, the number of wildlife species no longer existing shot up, adding up to 70 over the same period of time. It is obvious that the extinction of wildlife resulted from the population explosion. We may cite a variety of reasons for this situation. First of all, the destruction of ecological balance plays a pushing role. Due to population problems, pollution and desertification are becomeing increasingly serious. Furthermore, a great number of species were killed for food, for money and even for fun. Even worse, with the rapid growth of human population, inhabitable areas were expanding so fast that few areas were left for wild animals. To sum up, it is imperative for us to take effective measures to protect wildlife. Firstly, the U.S. government should pour more investment into wildlife protection in a bid to create a better environment. Secondly, the birth rate in the U.S. must be put under control as the dramatically expanding population gives rise to serious environmental problems.


如图所示，从1800年到1990年，美国人口从200万猛增到2.5亿。与此相反，灭绝的野生物钟数也直线上升，在同期增加到70种。显而易见，野生动物的灭绝源于人口剧增。 我们可以引用很多原因解释此现象。首先，生态平衡的破坏发挥了主导作用。由于人口问题，污染和沙漠化日渐严重。其次，很多物种由于捕食、盈利甚至娱乐而被猎杀。更糟糕的是，由于人口急剧增长，人类居住地扩张如此迅速，以至于野生动物无家可归。 总而言之，我们很有必要采取有效措施保护野生动物。首先，美国政府应向野生动物保护投入更多资金以便改善环境。其次，由于人口激增导致了严重的环境问题，美国人口出生率必须得到控制。
As is shown in the pictures, with the rampancy of commercial fishing, the number of fish has dramatically shrunk. In the first picture, we learn that the year 1900 witnessed a quite encouraging scene of world fishing. There were various kinds of fish and only one fishing-boat. On the contrary, in the second picture, in 1995 there was only one fish swimming freely but many fishing-boats sailing in the sea. It is apparent that a disastrous change has occurred. The purpose of the pictures is to tell us that due attention has to be paid to the reducation of ocean resources. Owing to the over-exploitation of marine resources, the numner of fish has declined at an accelerating rate. If we let this situation continue as it is, we do not know where the fish will be in the future. By that time, our environment will suffer a great destruction. Hence, it is imperative for us to take drastic measures to reverse this disturbing trend illustrated in the above pictures. For one thing, we should appeal to the authorities to make strict laws to control commercial fishing. For another, we should cultivate the awareness of people that ocean resources are of great significance to us. Only in this way can we protect our natural environment. I believe that we humans can surmount this difficulty and we will have a brilliant future.


如图所示，随着商业捕鱼的泛滥，鱼的数量已经显著下降。在第一幅图中，我们可以看到在1900年，世界捕鱼业是鼓舞人心的，画面上有很多鱼，但只有一艘渔船。而在第二幅图中，在1995年，只有一条鱼在游动，但有许多渔船在海上航行。显而易见，灾难性的变化已经发生。 这组图的目的是告诉我们应该对海洋资源的减少给予充分重视。由于海洋资源的过度开发，鱼的数量已经明显下降。如果听任这种情况发展，我们不知道鱼的未来在哪儿。到那时，我们的环境将会遭受巨大的破坏。 因此，我们急需采取严厉措施扭转图画中所示的令人困扰的趋势。一方面，我们应该呼吁各级政府制定严格的法律来控制商业捕鱼。另一方面，我们应该增强人们的意识：海洋资源对我们非常重要。只有这样才能保护我们的海洋资源。同时，我相信人类能够克服这个困难，并将拥有美好的未来。
The symbolic implication conveyed in the cartoon is that love is most desired where one is in difficulty. Among all the notable emotions of human race, the most sublime is love. As the picture depicts, love is just like a smiling lamp whose rays become brighter where it is darker. A case in point is the Project Hope. In many poverty-stricken areas in China, few children can afford to go to school owing to lack of financial support. Therefore, the Project Hope is initiated to help them get out of difficulty and continue their schooling. Let's take another example. The year 1998 witnessed a disastrous flood in China. At that time, people all over the country were united as one and donate whatever they could. Be it money or goods. A large number of donations were raised and sent to the severely affected areas, which helped the victims to relieve their difficult situation. Whenever one gets in trouble, it is our duty to lend a helping hand to him or her. As John F. Kennedy put it," Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Only in this way can each corner of our society be lit up by love.


漫画中所显示的象征意义是：人在陷入困境时，最需要爱。在所有有价值的人类感情中，爱是最崇高的。如图所示，爱心像一盏灯，在越黑暗的地方越明亮。 一个明显的例子就是希望工程。在中国的很多贫困地区，由于缺乏经济支持，很少有孩子能去上学。因此，人们发起希望工程来帮助他们走出困境继续学业。让我们再看一个例子。1998年中国发生了一场特大洪水。那时，全国人民团结一致，慷慨解囊，募集了大笔资金和物资并送往重灾区，减轻了灾民的困难。 无论何时有人陷入困境，我们都有义务伸出援助之手。正如约翰.肯尼迪所说：“不要问你的国家能为你做什么，要问你能为你的国家做什么。”只有这样，我们社会的每个角落才能充满爱。
The picture vividly depicts an American girl, wearing a traditional Chinese costume of a certain minority group, is smiling heartedly. She is wearing a long pair of ear rings and a necklace with a pearl tassel. Her hat is cute and trimmed with lace. The clothes add oriental charm to her beautiful appearance. In my opinion, what the picture conveys is far beyond a new fashion trend and carries cultural implications as well. It is clear that a unique culture can be accepted by the international society when its distinctive features are fully expressed. In fact, national cultures have no boundary and may be appreciated and shared by people from other cultral backgrounds. Admittedly, as the reflection of the outlook of the people, national cultural as priceless spiritual treasure ought to be preserved and cherished. At the same time, there are positive reasons to advocate international culture. While global economic integration has fostered thorough cultural interchanges, it is multiculturalism that essentially makes the society and its people diverse, colorful, vigorous and open-minded. Generally speaking, to be international is undisputedly the best choice if a nation wishes to adopt an open-minded way of progressing.


这幅图画生动地描述了一位美国姑娘穿着中国某个少数民族的传统服装，正在开心地微笑。她戴着一副长耳环和一条带着珍珠流苏的项链。她的帽子很可爱，还有花边修饰。这套衣服为她美丽的外表增添了东方魅力。 在我看来，这幅图画所显示的远不只是一种时尚潮流，还具有文化内涵。显而易见，当一种独特文化的特征被充分表现时，它就能被国际社会所接受。实际上，民族文化没有界限，可以被来自不同文化背景的人们所欣赏和分享。毫无疑问，作为对人们世界观的反映，作为物价的精神财富，民族文化应该被保存和珍惜。同时，我们有充分的理由发展世界文化。在全球经济一体化促进彻底的文化交流的同时，正是多元文化使社会与人民丰富多元、五彩缤纷、充满活力并思想开放。总而言之，如果一个国家想采取一种开放的进步方式，毋庸置疑，国际化是最佳选择。
As is vividly depicted in the first cartoon, the tender flower blossoms inside the greenhouse in spite of the gusty wind, driving rain and terrifying lightning. Unfortunately, as soon as it is exposed to the thunderstorm, it soon fades and withers, with its delicate petals washed away. The fact that flowers growing in the greenhouse cannot withstand the test of the storm indicates that too much comfort spoils the child. As the only child excessively cared by the parents, young people are often associated with the flowers. The greenhouse epitomizes parents' doting care which shelter the children from the thunderstorm, in other words, the competitive world. The greenhouse flower is too weak to survive in the wild, where weeds always flourish. In the same way, once young people met with some setbacks, they will feel frustrated and thus lose heart inevitably, which may well lead to tragedy of some kind. Only when a person experiences all sorts of trials and sufferings can he or she survive the blows of storms or misfortunes, and eventually establish himself firmly in the society. As the old saying goes, "Adversity leads to prosperity." Let's get out of the "greenhouse" to see the fascinating world, to mix up with people and get prepared for the fierce competition ahead.


如第一幅图所示，尽管狂风大作、暴雨倾盆、雷电交加，温室中娇弱的花朵仍然在绽放。不幸的是，当暴雨在雷雨之下后，它迅速凋零，花瓣散落一地。 温室里的花朵经不起风雨这一事实说明过于舒适的环境会宠坏孩子。由于父母过度关怀独生子女，人们经常把年轻人和花朵联系起来。温室是保护孩子免收诶与侵害的父母溺爱的缩影。雷雨换句话说就是充满竞争的世界。温室里的花朵太柔弱，无法在杂草丛生的野外生存下去。同样，一旦年轻人面临挫折，他们将感到沮丧，并不可避免的失去信心，这将导致某种悲剧。 只有当一个人经历了各种磨练和痛苦，才能经受风雨或不幸的打击，并最终在社会上文件立足。如谚语所说：“逆境迎向昌盛。”让我们走出温室去经历迷人的世界，与人们融洽相处，并为未来的激烈竞争做好准备。
The drawing vividly shows a runner who is making a spurt at the finishing line which is also a new point he will start from. In the drawing, the runner is running with painstaking effort around the track of a playground, sweat pouring down his face. On both sides of the runner, there are two poles and a line between them. On the ground there are two signs that say "ENDING" and "STARTING". The painter wants to tell us that, just like running, whatever we are doing, we should never stop making progress. First and formost, it applies to individuals as in such a competitive world everybody is trying to get ahead. Furthermore, the country on the world should move forward in terms of politics, economy, and culture so that we Chinese as a nation can gain sustained repect from other peoples. Examples to prove the view are abundant. The most persuasive are the cases of famous athletes like Fu Mingxia and Deng Yaping, whose success is gained through non-stop efforts. By contrast, a lot of people choose to take a rest to enjoy their small success and thus lose the motivation for further achievement. In sum, keeping making progress should be the right attitude towards life and work for everybody and even for a country.


这幅画生动地描绘了一个跑步者正在冲向终点，这个终点同时也是一个新的起点。在图画中，他正付出艰苦的努力，绕着操场的跑道奔跑，汗水淌下脸庞。在他的两边，有两个标杆，标杆间有一条线。地面上有两个标记，写着“终点”和“起点”。 画家想传达给我们的是，正如跑步一样，无论我们做什么，都不应停止前进。首先，它适用于个人。因为在这样一个充满竞争的世界里，每个人都在努力向前。其次，整个国家在政治、经济和文化方面也应该不断前进，这样中国菜能赢得各国人民的长久尊敬。 能证明这个观点的例子不胜枚举。最有说服力的就是诸如伏明霞和邓亚萍等著名运动员的例子。她们的成功正是通过永不停息的努力获得的。总之，不断取得进步应是每个人甚至国家对于生活和工作的正确态度。
As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, four children are playing a "football match" of taking care of their aged father. Each of them stands in a different corner of a football field. The eldest son kicked out the father with the other three children guarding their goals. The purpose of the drawing is to show us that due attention has be paid to the mistreatment of senior citizens. First and foremost, some people shirk their duty of financially supporting their old and helpless parents due to their own interests. Furthermore, some elderly peolple are often ill-treated by their own children and cannot lead a normal life. Last but not least, while some young people enjoy a comfortable life, their parents are neglected and reduced to utter poverty. It is imperative for us to take drastic measures. To begin with, relevant laws and regulations should be made to severely punish those who shun the responsibilties of caring for their parents. In addition, we should cultivate the awareness of the young that respecting the old has always been the traditional virtue of Chinese cultral. Only in this way can we curb the current evil phenomenon revealed in the picture.


图片生动地展示了四个子女正在进行一场养老“足球赛”。他们每个人站在足球场的一角。大儿子将父亲踢出，而其他三个子女则守住自己的球门。 这副图画的目的是告诉我们应该对老年人受虐待的问题给予高度重视。首先，有些人出于个人利益，逃避赡养年迈无助的双亲的责任。其次，有些老年人受尽子女的虐待，无法过上正常的生活。最后，在年轻人享受安逸生活的同时，他们的父母受尽冷落，一贫如洗。 我们迫切需要采取严厉的措施。一方面，我们应该制定相关的法规严惩那些逃避养老责任的子女。另一方面，我们应当培养年轻人的意识：尊敬老人是中国文化的传统美德。只有这样我们才能遏制图片中所揭露的当前存在的丑恶现象。
The two photos show that people are enthusiastic about football stars such as the English football player Beckham. Some like the young man in the photo express their enthusiasm by writing his name on their faces, while others, like the one in the hair studio, spend as much as 300 yuan for a hairstyle modeling on that of Beckham. In fact, that kind of star-worshipping is not uncommon nowadays among the Chinese people. For example, the so-called "Super Girls" became fashionable almost overnight, with fans chasing after them in a kind of blind worship. It seems as is people are badly in need of someone to whom to pay their respect and to realize their own aspirations of an immediate success or stardom. Famous football players won our favor and earned our respect by their hardwork and excellent performance on the football field. What, then, deserves to be worshipped, their diligence and perseverance, or their hairstyle and ways of living? The answer seems self-evident: what we should learn is their spirit, not the superficial styles of living. Fashion is often short-lived, but the ever-lasting memory of a courageous, undaunted and skillful football player is what inspires us in our pursuit for better life and brighter future.


这两张照片反映了人们对于像英国足球明星贝克汉姆这样的足星非常狂热。有些人像图片中的年轻人一样，通过在脸上写贝克汉姆的名字来表达他们的狂热；而另一些人则像理发店中的年轻人一样，花300元做个“小贝头”。 事实上，在当今中国人中，这种明星崇拜并不少见。例如，所谓的“超级女生”大赛几乎一夜成名，而粉丝们则以一种盲目的崇拜来追逐他们。似乎人们迫切需要向某些人表达自己的敬意，同时满足自己马上成功或成为明星的渴望。 著名的足球明星们通过自己在足球场上的艰苦努力和卓越表现，赢得了我们的喜爱和尊敬。那么，究竟是什么值得我们崇拜呢？是他们的勤奋与坚定，还是他们的发型和生活方式？答案似乎不言自明：我们应该学习的是他们的精神，而不是表面的生活方式。时尚总是昙花一现，而对于一个勇敢无畏、技艺精湛的足球明星的永恒记忆，才能激励我们追求更好的生活和光辉的未来。
It is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon that a striker is preparing to shoot at the goal defended by a goalkeeper on a football field. In the goalkeeper's mind, he is so much smaller than he actually is that guarding the goal becomes a mission impossible. On the contrary, the giant guard seems to fail up the whole goal in the attacking players mind. The purpose of the drawing is to show us that in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges or predicament, possessing self-confidence is of utmost significance. Regardless of how much success one has had in school or at work, there are bound to be times when he or she wiil encounter problems. It is at these critical times that his self-confidence, toward difficulty and life in general, eventually plays a crucial role in determining whether he can turn failure into victory. I can think of no better illustration than the following one. Helen Keller was deaf, dumb and blind, certainly, nothing to give her self-confidence. Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecturer, to become an inspiration to all. This case effectively clarifies that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities.


这幅漫画生动地描述了足球场上的一名前锋正准备将球射入守门员把守的球门。在守门员看来，比起实际的身材自己渺小很多，以至于守门变成一件不可能完成的任务。相反，在再那名前锋眼里，这位巨人守门员几乎占据了整个球门。 这幅漫画的目的是要告诉我们在看似不可克服的挑战与困境面前，最重要的是拥有自信。无论一个人在学校或工作上曾经如何成功，总有一天他会遭到难题。关键时刻，正是他对困境和人生的自信最终决定他能否反败为胜。 没有什么比下面这个例子更有说服力。海伦.凯勒聋哑失明，没有什么可以让她自信。但她不断克服多种障碍，最终成为了作家和教师，成为世人的楷模。这个例子清楚证明了无论面临何种任务，我们绝不能高估困难或低估自己的能力。
As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, supporting each other with their firm hands, two handicapped adolescents are continuing their new journey on the ground. Crutches left behind, they have successfully cracked the hard nut of lameness which might have confused the majority of the disabled. The caption indicates, "You have merely one leg and so do I. Helping each other, we can travel all around." Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist is trying to attract our attention to the issue of cooperation. According to a survey conducted among a group of people who were in the same college class ten years ago, those who are ready to give their cooperation to others all became rich or managers of all fields, while not a single young man having difficulty in getting along with their classmates becomes an executive or a boss. Why those who are excellent in team work tend to be managers or run their own enterprise in their later life? The answer seems self-evident. On the one hand, if you are competent in profession but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even your boss, you can hardly survive the corporation. On the other hand, your chances of success are much higher with wide circle of friends who are willing to corporate with you to provide information and resources. It is my view that, first and foremost, we can frequently use the drawing to enlighten the juvenile to learn to cooperate successfully with each other. Furthermore, whatever difficulty or situation we are confronted with, those who have the spirit of cooperation and team work are nearer to success. Just as John Adams, the second U.S. president quoted from the ancient Greek Aesop's Fables, "United we stand, divided we fall."


如漫画中象征性所示，两个残疾的年轻人用有力的双手互相搀扶，正在打的上开始新的旅程。他们将拐杖抛在身后，成功的解决了可能困扰大多数残疾人的难题。文字说明显示：“你一条腿，我一条腿。你我一起，走南闯北。” 毫无疑问，我们能从这幅漫画中看出，作者正在吸引我们重视合作的问题。根据针对十年前曾在同一大学班级中的一群人进行的调查，那些乐于和他人合作的人都富裕起来或成为各行各业的经理，而没有一个难以与同班同学相处的人成为管理人员或老板。为什么那些擅长团队合作的人后来能成为经理或经营自己的企业呢？答案似乎不言自明。一方面，如果你只是胜任工作，但和你的同事甚至老板相处困难，你公司中就很难生存。另一方面，如果大批朋友愿意与你合作并愿意为你提供信息和资源，你成功的几率就会大很多。 首先，我认为我们可以经常利用这幅漫画来启发青少年们学会成功地相互合作。其次，无论我们面临何种困难或境地，那些具有合作与团队精神的人更容易成功。正如美国第二任总统约翰.亚当斯所引用的古希腊《伊索寓言》中的名言：“合则存，分则败。”
As is subtly reviewed in the portrayal, a great many people are surfing online. Separated by the stretching spider web, these cyber citizens attempt to communicate with each other. Undoubtedly, the Internet exerts such a profound effect on our life, that it revolutionizes the way of poeple's living and thinking. The exaggerative and impressive drawing has symbolically reflected the duality of the relationship between man and the Internet. The spider web epitomizes the Internet which is the most efficient contemporary media of interpersonnal communication. People isolated from each other represent those net citizens who have lost the skill of face-to-face contact and get alienated from each other. The fact that peopel feel reluctant to contact others directly indicates that to some extent some people are too much addicted to the Internet to maintain a regular and wholesome lifestyle. Hence, it is necessary for us to use the Internet in a reasonable way and restrain from overindulgence. For one thing, in addition to providing us many of the facilities and services we now must travle to obtain, with the Internet, the computer will even let us communicated directly with people all over the world and with information sources worldwide. For another, as nearly all activities could be conducted in the comfort of our own homes or offices, we could all become hermit-like, never feeling any need to leave the computer. Accordingly, the challenge of the Internet means we should consider how we can use it, so that it won't control us.


如漫画中所细致揭示的，很多人正在网上冲浪。这些网民被拉伸的蜘蛛网隔开来，试图互相交流。毫无疑问，互联网对我们的生活产生了如此深远的影响，以至于它彻底改变了人们的生活和思考的方式。 这幅夸张且令人印象深刻的漫画象征性地揭示了人与互联网之间的双重关系。这张蜘蛛网是网络这一最搞笑的当代人际交流媒介的缩影。被隔开的人们象征着那些已经丧失面对面交流能力并彼此疏远的网民。人们不愿直接交流的这一事实证明，在某种程度上，有些人太沉迷于网络而无法保持一种正常和健康的生活方式。 因此，我们很有必要以一种合理的方式使用网络，避免过度沉迷。一方面，除了为我们提供很多现在必须远途获取的设施和服务外，通过网络，电脑甚至可以使我们直接与全世界的人们进行交流，并获得全球的信息资源。另一方面，由于几乎所有活动都可以在我们舒适的家庭或办公室中进行，我们可能全都变得像隐士一样，无需离开电脑。总之，互联网的挑战在于我们应该考虑如何使用网络，以免身受其控。
As is symbolically illustrated in the portrayal, there is a boiling hot pot containing various and ingredients of multi-cultures. These pluralistic cultures can be categorized as cultural celebrities home and abroad as Bi Sheng, Lao She, Shakespeare and Einstein, philosophical concepts as Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, benevolence, ritual, humanism, enlightenment, post-modernism and deconstruction, as well as performing arts as Peking Opera, Kung-fu and Swan Lake. We are informed that the cultural "hot pot" is both delicious and nutritious. The purpose of the cartoonist is to show us that instead of being outdated and of little value in rapidly modernizing world, cultural blending should be encouraged and maintained.


如图象征性所示，一直沸腾的火锅中拥有诸多多元文化元素。这些多元文化可分为毕昇、老舍、莎士比亚、爱因斯坦等国内外名人，佛、道、儒、仁、礼、人本、启蒙、后现代、结构等哲学概念，以及京剧、功夫、《天鹅湖》等表演艺术。文字说明显示：“文化‘火锅’，既美味又营养。” 画家的目的是告诉我们，在迅速现代化的世界里，文化融合并未过时或失去价值，相反，还应受到鼓励和保护。
On the one hand, mosaic cultures are part of the universal heritage of humanity and they are powerful means of bringing together diverse peoples and social groups. Consequently, cultural integration has become indispensable as a means of promoting further culture development and maintenance. On the other hand, for China and many other rapidly developing countries, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadows of modernization. If kung-fu, Peking opera or The Swan Lake Ballet ever perished from the earth, it would be a tragedy of immeasurable proportions. In my view, multi-cultures can be kept alive by the people with the time to do so, and is extremely vital in ensuring a community's future development and prosperity. As a consequence of successful commercialization efforts, unwavering government support and growing interest overseas, the future of cultural blending looks brighter and more secure than ever before.


一方面，多元文化作为全体人类遗产的一部分，是将不同人群和社会群体融合的有力方式。因此，文化融合作为促进文化发展和保护的一种方式，已经不可或缺。另一方面，对于中国和其他快速发展的国家来说，古老的习俗和传统面临着在现代化阴影里消失的危险。如果京剧、功夫或《天鹅湖》从地球上消失，那将是不可估量的损失。 在我看来，如果人们能为多元文化花费时间的话，那么他就能够长存。这对确保将来社会的繁荣和发展至关重要。由于成功的商业化努力、政府坚定不移的支持和不断增长的海外兴趣，多元文化的将来会比过去任何时候都明朗、安全。
From in information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between mobile-phone subscriptions between developing and developed countries from 2000 to 2008. During this period, there has been a dramatic increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile-phone subscriptions in developing countries, while that of developed countries remained steady under 1 billion. At least two fundamental factors could contributed to this phenomenon. On the one hand, with the rapid increase in economy happening in the developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries got a great bound to meet the demand of globalization. As a result, the user of mobile phone which can narrow the distance between people and link the whole world together rose at an incredible speed.


根据以上柱状图提供的信息，我们可以看出，从2000年到2008年，发展中国家和发达国家在手机入网方面灿在着惊人的对比。在此期间，发展中国家手机入网数从4亿急速增长到40亿，而发达国家的相关数据在10亿之下保持平稳。 至少有两点主要原因造成了这种现象。一方面，随着在大战中国家大声的快速经济增长，这些国家的电信产业必然会适应全球化的需求。因此，使用手机缩短人们之间的距离并与全世界联系的人数以惊人的速度增长。
On the other hand, the extremely advanced civilization of developed countries means less potential in many aspects including in the area of private telecommunication tools and their demand for further enlargement of such tools tends to saturation. In conclusion, while mobile-phone subscriptions, if used carelessly or without restraint, could prove to be a double-edged sword, the fact remains that it is already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed countries and even today, continues to rise in popularity. If people could imbue themseves with intelligence, prudence and discretion, I am sure that most of them wil be able to sidestep the potential drawbacks of mobile-phones as well as take advantage of all the merits.


另一方面，发达国家极端先进的文明在私人电信工具等诸多领域意味着更少的发展潜力，他们对进一步开发此类工具的需求趋于饱和。 因此，如果不小心或没有节制，手机入网就是一把双刃剑。但事实上，手机入网在发展中国家和发达国家中均十分流行，这种趋势甚至今天还在继续扩大。加入人们多动脑、谨慎些、具有判断力，我确信大多数人都能够克服手机的弊端，利用其优势。
The picture is the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics logo. The emblem has a single Chinese character on a traditional red Chinese seal. The English words "Beijing 2008" are written with a Chinese brush below it. At the bottom of the picture, there are the five rings of Olympic Games. The figure in the logo resembles a runner or dancer and the Chinese character "jing" which means "capital". The image carries the message that today's China is not only a nation with a long and glorious city, but also one full of modern in dynamics. First and foremost, this logo is a journey to the future. The emblem for China moving towards the 2008 Olympic Games. What is more, it is a symbol of the city's promise to makes the Game a success. Accordingly, this emblem represents the heart of an ancient culture embracing the modern world. The spirit of a people moving towards a new destiny. In my view, first of all, the Olympic Game represent the spirit of sports. Arms flung wide, it invites all people and the world to share the city's history, beauty, energy and it's future. In addition, it is a gesture of frienship and hope that the community of nations will unite in peace through sports.


图片上是北京2008夏季奥运会的会徽。这一标志在传统的中国红色的印章上刻着一个汉字。下方是用中国毛笔书写的“北京2008”的英文字样。在图片底部则是奥运五环。会徽中的人物象征着一位跑步者或舞者，而汉字“京”的意思则是“首都”。 这 一会徽表达了中国不仅是一个拥有灿烂悠久历史的国家，同时也充满着现代活力。首先，这个会徽是一次奔向未来的旅程，是中国迈向2008奥运会的标志。其次，它象征着我们国家成功举办奥运会的承诺。因此，这个标志代表了一种悠久文化拥抱现代世界的信心，以及中国人民迈向新征程的精神。 在我看来，奥林匹克运动会首先代表了运动精神。它伸展了双臂，邀请全世界及其人民来分享一个城市的历史，魅力，能量和它的未来。此外，它以友谊的姿态，希望国际社会能通过运动进而和平共处。
It is vividly depicted in the pictures that the Shenzhou-VII, or "Divine Ship", has carried three Chinese astronauts into orbit and the country into the prestigious space club pioneered four decades ago by the Soviet Union and the United States. As the inventor of the ancient rocket, the Chinese nation had cherished a space dream for centuries. The launch of its first satellite, the Dongfanghong, in 1970 ushered in China's space age. At present, the Shenzhou-VII marks another giant stride in China's space trek. The blast-off of China's manned spacecraft will definitely breathe new energy into the country's pursuit of space technologies for the overall welfare of its people.


图片形象地描绘了神舟七号宇宙飞船搭载着三名中国宇航员进入轨道，并且使中国进入由苏联和美国在40年前发起的享有盛誉的太空俱乐部。中国作为古代火箭的发明者，数百年来一直都怀有着太空梦想。1970年我国第一个人造卫星东方红的发射使得中国进入太空时代。如今，“神舟七号”标志着中国在太空征程中的又有一个大跨步的飞跃。 为了全国人民的利益，中国载人宇宙飞船的发射将为中国太所空间科技注入新的活力。
Just imagine what new seed varieties with higher yields and better qualities, which are developed in space, would mean to a country, with 1.3 billion people. It is hoped that wider applications of space technology will turn out to be an important driving force in the country's economic and social deveopment. It is my view that expensive as they are, manned missions are worth it. In addition to offering a tremendous boost to a country's technological capbilities and creating a plenitude of other possibilities, they are a huge morale booster. The succesful launch of Shenzhou-VII has clearly showcased the value of devotion, co-operation and pursuit of the unknown. And the upbeat spirit the three Chinese astronauts demonstrated in the face of the unknown will inspire the nation to take on challenges as it continues to evolve.


设想一下：在太空中培育更高产量和质量的新种子将对一个有着13亿人口的国家意味着什么。对空间技术的更广泛的运用将成为城市经济和社会发展的巨大推动力。 在我看来，尽管载人飞船耗资巨大，但是物有所值。除了对我国技术力量产生巨大的推动以外，它也将极大的鼓舞全国人民的精神。“神舟七号”的成功发射已经清楚的证明了奉献，合作以及探索未知的价值所在。而三位宇航员在面对未知事物时的乐观精神将激励中国在未来的发展中应对将会面临的种种挑战。
As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a smart boy and a pretty girl are staring at a huge constrution entitled "harmonious society". The construction is based on harmonious cities, countries, communities, families, campuses, enterprises and medical treatment, to name only a few. Although a lot of efforts have been put into bridging the widening gap between rich and poor in our nation, the situation is far from optimistic. A case in point is the uneven development of our nation. On the one hand, some people in the developed areas of country are enjoying almost everything that modern civilization can offer - luxury cars, expensive houses and other devices for comfortable living.


这幅漫画象征性地描绘了一个伶俐的小男孩和一个漂亮的小女孩正在仰望一个名为“和谐社会”的巨大建筑。这个建筑建立在和谐城市、和谐乡镇、和谐家庭、和谐校园、和谐企业、和和谐医疗等基础上。 尽管我们已经付出巨大努力来弥补我国贫富之间日益加剧的差距，但是情况远远不能令人乐观。我国的不平衡发展就是一个很好的例子。一方面，有些发达地区的人们正在享受现代文明几乎能够提供的一切——豪华轿车、豪华住宅以及提供舒适生活的其他设施。
On the other hand, in some underdeveloped areas, a great many people are still living in sheer poverty. They do not have the minimal means of living, even no money for the education of the young. Looking at all these, how can we stay aloof and easy? Our nation is building up a harmonious society. If we do not do something to harmonize the situation by achieving common welfare for al the people, how can we accomplish that noble goal? To begin with, we each individual should start from right here and now to attach great value and importance to the urgency of the issue. Furthermore, in a bid to working towards a harmonious nation where the rich is just and the poor secure, it is high time that we took drastic actions to build up a harmonious society.


另一方面，在一些欠发达的地区，很多人仍然生活在极端的贫困中。他们缺乏最基本的生活手段，甚至没有钱供年轻人上学。鉴于此，我们怎能无动于衷？ 我们的国家正在建设和谐社会。如果我们不为全体人民谋求共同福利来平衡这种状况，又怎能达到这一崇高目标？首先，我们每个人都应马上重视这个问题的紧迫性。其次，为了创建公平致富、保障贫困地区权益的和谐国家，我们应该采取严厉措施来建设和谐社会。
It is symbolically revealed in the cartoon that sand storm in a city is so heavy that taxis cannot move any more. A passenger with a mask on his mouth, is riding on the back of a camel, which is the new "taxi". The purpose of the cartoon is to show us that utmost importance should be attached to environmental protection. On the one hand, it so happens that we cut trees to clear land for farming and level up a lake to build houses. The result of so doing and other destructive developements is deforestation and uncontrollable desertification, thus driving us homeless like the scene we see above. On the other hand, scientists have warned that unless drastic steps are taken, the problem of sand storm will eventually get out of hand. As a matter of fact, people from all walks of life are showing a real concern over this issue. From my point of view, we should work out concrete solutions to the problem. For one thing, the best way to fight back against the greedy desert is to vigorously set about the task of planting trees and grasses for the reforestation to reclaim the land. For another, since trees play a vital role in water and soil conservation, we must waste no natural resources and possibly develop alternative forms of energy to replace the decreasing resources. Accordingly, the earth is our home and we have the duty to take care of it for ourselves and our descendants.


这幅漫画象征性地描述了一个城市中的沙尘暴非常严重，以至于出租车无法开动。一位行人面带口罩，骑在新的“出租车”——一只骆驼的背上。 这幅漫画的目的是告诉我们应该充分重视环境保护。一方面，我们砍伐树木以便获得耕地，填平湖泊以便修建房屋。这些行为以及其他破坏性发展的结果就是乱砍滥伐和无节制的土地沙化。最终如我们看到的景象一样，使得我们无家可归。另一方面，科学家已经警告我们，除非采取严厉措施，否则沙尘暴问题将最终失控。事实上，各行各业的人们正在对这个问题予以充分关注。 在我看来，我们对这个问题应该制定具体的措施。首先，由于树木在水土保持中发挥重要作用，抵制贪婪的沙漠的最好方法就是积极地开展植树种草、收回土地的工作。其次，我们必须停止浪费自然资源，并且发展替代正在减少的资源的可行性能源形式。地球是我们的家园，我们有责任为了我们自己和子孙后代照顾好她。
The pictures symbolically illustrate pollution is becoming increasingly serious around the globe. In the first cartoon, a man is scorching the earth on a chimney. In the second one, Wong Bo, the famous ancient Chinese poet, is astonished by the heavy smoke poured by chimneys and the dirty river polluted by a factory. We are informed that "the autumn river shares a scenic hue with the vast sky". The drawer is sending a message about the significance of the need of everyone to fight against the danger of the environmental pollution. There is no dying that a developed industry is indications of civilization, progress and development. Unfortunately, as industry develops, a number of factories spring up and so will the pollutants. We are so development-oriented that we almost sacrifice our blue sky and pure water in purpose of obtaining a little material gain. As a consequence, it is imperative for us to take drastic actions. On the one hand, factories should be equipped with devices which can dispose of waste gas and water in a bid to prevent them from polluting our planet. On the other hand, there should be an increasingly loud voice from the public for firm measures against poisonous gas and unhealthy water sent off by factories.


这些图片象征性地描述了全球污染问题正在日益严重。在第一幅图片中，一个人正在烟囱上烘烤地球。在第二幅图中，中国古代著名诗人王勃，被从烟囱中排放出来的浓烟和被工厂排放的废水污染的河流震惊了。文字说明显示：“秋水共长天一色”。 画家传递了如下重要的信息：每个人都必须抵制环境污染的危害。毫无疑问，发达的工业是文明、进步与发展的标志。然而，随着工业的发展，大量的工厂涌现出来，工业污染物的数量也会迅速增加。我们如此以发展为导向，以至于为了获取一点物质利益，几乎牺牲了蓝天净水。 因此，我们急需采取严厉措施。一方面，工厂应该配备能够处理废气和废水的设施，以阻止它们污染我们的星球。另一方面，公众应该加大呼吁采取强有力的措施，控制工厂排放的毒气和废水。
The pictures vividly reveal that heavy traffic is becoming increasingly serious all over the world. In the first photo, there is traffic congestion on the road with numerous cars, trucks and buses. In the second picture, hundreds of people are waiting for a train. We can deduce from the pictures that the photographer is tring to attract our attention to the issue of heavy traffic. First of all, every year men and women crowd into cities in search of employment, a decent living, and the excitement and stimulation of urban life. As people in mounting numbers flood into cities, city services and facilities have been strained to a breaking point. In addition, in a city with booming industry, land is precious and cannot be extravagantly used by traffic. Traffic flows constantly rise to fill whatever scale of roads and highways provided for them. It is imperative for us to improve this situation. For one thing, the number of private cars should be limited while more bus routes should be opened up because buses can accommodate more passengers. For another, more streets and roads should be constructed. Since neither of the suggestions can effectively solve the problem, there is an increasing awareness that the two solutions may be combined with other possible solutions to produce the best effect.


这些照片生动地揭示了交通拥挤正在全世界变得日益严重。图一中，道路上交通堵塞，有无数轿车、卡车和公交车。图二中，成百上千的人正在等地铁。 我们可以从这些图片中看出，摄影师正在努力吸引我们关注交通拥挤的问题。首先，每年人们涌进城市里寻求就业机会、体面的生活以及都市生活的激动与刺激。由于越来越多的人涌进城市，城市服务与设施的承受能力已经达到临界点。此外，在工业迅速发展的城市中，土地非常珍贵，不能被交通过度挤占。无论公路和高速路修建到何种规模，车流总是不断地增加，直至挤满道路。 我们迫切需要改善这种状况。首先，由于公交可以运载更多乘客，我们应该限制私家车的数量，开辟更多公交线路。其次，我们应该建设更多道路。由于这两个措施都不能单独有效地解决这个问题，人们越来越意识到为了达到最佳效果，我们可以把这两个措施和其他可能的措施结合起来。

,It starts with one thing

,It doesn't even matter
,How hard you try
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme

,Time is a valuable thing
,Watch it fly by
,As the pendulum swings
,Watch it count down
,To the end of the day
,The clock ticks life away
,It's so unreal
,Didn't look out below
,Watch the time go
,Right out the window
,Trying to hold on,
,But didn't even know
,Wasted it all just
,To watch you go
,I kept everything inside and
,Even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a

,In spite of the way
,You were mocking me
,Acting like I was
,Part of your property
,Remembering all the
,Times you fought with me
,I'm surprised it got so (far)
,Things aren't the way
,They were before
,You wouldn't even
,Recognise me anymore
,Not that you
,Knew me back then
,But it all comes
,Back to me (in the end)

,I remembered black skies
,the lightning all around me
,I remembered each flash
,as time began to blur
,Like a startling sign
,that fate had finally found me
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
,Give me reason
,to fill this hole
,connect the space between
,Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
,Across this new divide
,There was nothing in sight
,but memories left abandoned
,There was nowhere to hide
,the ashes fell like snow
,And the ground caved in between where we were standing
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
,Across this new divide
,In every loss
,in every lie
,In every truth that you'd deny
,And each regret
,and each goodbye
,was a mistake to great to hide
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
,Give me reason
,to fill this hole
,connect the space between
,Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
,Across this new divide
,Across this new divide
,Across this new divide

,I was doubling over the load on my shoulders
,Was a weight I carried with me everyday
,Crossing miles of frustrations and rivers a raging
,Picking up stones I found along the way
,I staggered and I stumbled down
,Pathways of trouble
,I was hauling those souvenirs of misery
,And with each step taken my back was breaking
,'Til I found the One who took it all from me
,Down by the riverside
,（Down by the riverside）
,I laid my burdens down
,Now I'm traveling light
,My spirit lifted high
,（I found my freedom now）
,I found my freedom now
,And I'm traveling light
,Through the darkest alleys and loneliest valleys
,I was dragging those heavy chains of doubt and fear
,Then with the one word spoken the locks were broken
,Now He's leading me to places
,Where there are no tears
,Down by the riverside

Evolution is a mystery
A small change that no one sees.
Clock makes a fool of history .
Yesterday's so long ago, don't agree with what I know .
Tomorrow becomes a place to be.
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOLUTION
See my reflection change.
Nothing ever stays the same
But you know the name's the game.
We all know what it means
Nothings ever what it seems
Unforgiven
Unforseen
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOULTION
Take that hope

And its so burning hot to make me

I just dont care anymore
I dont care anymore

The rich takes this new kid getting richer
And the poor they got none left
But you one more got from that stall man
because he screams whats wrong with this.

I just dont care anymore
I dont care anymore
I just dont care anymore
I just dont care!

I dont care what you think of me
I dont care what you think you are
Dont care if you think youre right and wrong
I wont be what youve always been
And your life belongs to me!

Belongs to me!
Creed is nobodies cancer
And you took whats more than you should
Then you thought we always would follow
You were wrong and we know no one cared.

I just dont care anymore
I dont care anymore
I just dont care anymore
I just dont care!
I dont care what you think of me
I dont care what you think you are
Dont care if you think youre right and wrong
I wont be what youve always been
And your life belongs to me!
Belongs to me!
Belongs to me!
Belongs to me!
Me!
To me!

,Ooo, in your wild eyes
,In your wild eyes
,Ooo, in your wild eyes
,In your wild eyes
,It's the way you love
,And the rules you make
,You amplify my desire to escape
,I need the highs you think you know
,Places where I'd never dare to go
,In the dark they go like stars,

,In the night I see them glow

,You don't even know how very special you are

,You're everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can't believe that you're mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you're leaving me
,Breathless
,And if our love was a story book
,We would meet on the very first page
,The last chapter would be about
,How I'm thankful for the life we've made
,And if we had babies they would have your eyes
,I would fall deeper watching you give life
,You don't even know how very special you are
,You leave me breathless
,You're everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can't believe that you're mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you're leaving me
,You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
,You're like an angel
,The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
,You're something special
,I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me

,It's a fairytale
,oh~
,Once upon a time
,Our ancestors discovered a precarious flow of water
,By following these magical streams they found a mysterious structure
,Writing on the wall read, those who drink from the holy waters
,Will obtain the power of eternal youth
,Let them guide you to the sacred grounds
,And taste the holy waters of the fountain of youth, youth, youth…
,It's a fairytale

,When it went down
,It was so hard to breathe
,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine~~~
,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace

,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along

,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much

,I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
,I'm ready to forgive but forgetting is a harder fight

,Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
,Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
,Darlin' I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
,Baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty three

,People fall in love in mysterious ways
,Maybe just a touch of a hand
,Me I fall in love with you every single day
,I just wanna tell you I am
,So honey now
,When my hairs all've gone and my memory fades
,And the crowds dont remember my name
,When my hands don't play the strings the same way
,I know you will still love me the same
,'Cause honey your soul can never grow old it's evergreen

,Overseas ya we tryin' to stop terrorism
,But we still got terrorists here livin'
,In the U.S.A, the big C.I.A
,The bloods and the crips, and the KKK
,But if you only got love for your own ways
,Then you only leave space to discriminate
,To discriminate only generates hate
,And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
,Madness is what you demonstrate
,And that's exactly how anger works and operates
,Man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight
,Take control of your mind and meditate
,Let your soul gravitate
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)

,
,Time feels like it's slipping away from me
,Rewind to the days where we ran free
,Locked in where these colors fade back to gray
,But hold on 'cause Im going to break away
,I hear you calling for
,me to lead my lights out and see through
,a sky that's bright now to meet you
,and make the stars come out
,Could I fix these
,Lost and fragmented pieces
,of forgotten hope that I needed
,and pretend they're not all gone?
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, Ill make an escape
,Float back to these oceans where I fall asleep
,I swim up even though I drown into the deep
,Lights flick as the pendelum ceases swings
,It's only seconds 'til these walls cave in
,I'm asking you to help wake me
,from these nightmares and save me
,let my thoughts fade away to memories
,that all made perfect sense
,Hyponotize me,
,This twilight where I can think clear
,and make this wish that you'll be here
,to stop these falling tears
,Now I'm caught up in daydreams
,I'm falling down into this starlight stream
,I didn't think that I would rather be high,
,in skies that feel so far away from me
,Yeah, Ill make an escape
,
,
,
,
,
,You showed me you weren't
,Just another open door
,You showed me I could
,Give back but you took it all
,You spent too long
,Hiding frozen always afraid
,I'd rather be alone,alone
,No more crying from the bedroom
,No more empty bottles sippin' down with booze
,'Cause nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,You are a tree falling down in the woods
,But there ain't a sound 'cause no one's around
,Nobody can hear you
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you
,Smokin' your cigarette
,Burnin' out till there's nothing left
,I bared you my wounds
,Yet you cut me deep I can't forget
,So I gave you up
,Like a drug so high then I came down
,That's why I couldn't stay around,around
,No more crying from the bedroom
,No more empty bottles sippin' down with booze
,'Cause nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,You are a tree falling down in the woods
,But there ain't a sound 'cause no one's around
,Nobody can hear you
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you
,Nobody can,no
,Nobody can,no
,Nobody can,no
,I can still hear you
,Nobody can,no
,Nobody can,no
,Nobody can,no
,I can still hear you
,No more crying from the bedroom
,No more empty bottles sippin' down with booze
,'Cause nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,You are a tree falling down in the woods
,But there ain't a sound 'cause no one's around
,Nobody can hear you
,Nobody can hear you,oh
,Nobody can hear you

,This time it don't feel like you want it all
,Did I do something wrong to make you go?
,Said I would know when it's all good to fall
,Now I just need you here to hold me close
,Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
,That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
,I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
,But the city feels so lonely when you leave
,My room, where I want you
,Tangled ease in my sheets
,In your shirt that I got you
,Half asleep, holding onto me
,My bed where you left me
,Tangled up, now it's noon
,In your shirt that you gave me
,Half asleep, wishing I still had you
,Half asleep, wishing I still had you
,This time you said you're playing games again
,What are we becoming of it now?
,It's fine, I said, if you're the one in my head
,Cause I just don't know how to put you out

,请你打开电视看看
,多少人为生命在努力勇敢的走下去
,我们是不是该知足
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡
,随着稻香河流继续奔跑
,微微笑 小时候的梦我知道
,不要哭让萤火虫带着你逃跑
,乡间的歌谣永远的依靠
,回家吧 回到最初的美好
,不要这麽容易就想放弃 就像我说的
,追不到的梦想 换个梦不就得了
,为自己的人生鲜艳上色 先把爱涂上喜欢的颜色
,笑一个吧 功成名就不是目的
,让自己快乐快乐这才叫做意义
,童年的纸飞机 现在终於飞回我手里
,所谓的那快乐 赤脚在田里追蜻蜓追到累了
,偷摘水果被蜜蜂给叮到怕了 谁在偷笑呢
,我靠着稻草人吹着风唱着歌睡着了
,哦 哦 午后吉它在虫鸣中更清脆
,哦 哦 阳光洒在路上就不怕心碎
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡

,看过最壮丽的日出
,在午夜公路旁
,对着夜空说我不服输
,押上了性命做赌注
,也曾和魔鬼跳过舞
,早已看透那些套路

,随性得像个浪子
,也认真得像个傻子
,我走过的黑暗与孤独
,受过的背叛和无助
,却依然参不透这心魔
,只学会了率性而活
,你我都是这茫茫人海中
,渺小不起眼的那一棵草
,但谁说小人物不可以做英雄

,人家都说 帅 酷 美
,唉～真的是

,看似慌得一批 其实我稳如老狗
,一脚油门踩上马蹄山 尽管山路本不好走
,蹲在反斜坡卡视野 跟你玩手恐怖游戏
,抽空打波绷带止血 然后让你痛哭流涕
,连架枪都不会 还敢收我过桥费
,在机场见过我的人 早已回到盒中睡
,活着不好吗 为什么要捡98k
,除了神仙那一挂没人能抢我的首杀位
,最讨厌那些伏地魔 出门必备平底锅
,不仅打法猥琐 而且还tm的行李多
,全程缩圈摸毒边 厕所是他的根据地
,从没胆子亭亭玉立 凉的时候万念俱寂
,在尖刀队眼里吃鸡就像联手驭蝗虫
,想给某类人体描边大师点首夕阳红
,别再发微信 给我八倍镜 化身钓鱼执法官
,那些愣头青 还敢瞪流星 看我把他屎打穿

,NE方向有人 这波别去敌后绕
,赶紧舔完这波包 兄弟你真不奏效
,杀完才报点 无可救药的马后炮
,这游戏神仙当道 太多人走上了不归
,路飞橡胶火箭炮 遇到它只能变墓碑
,别跟安全区的幻影坦克攀比 随时能干翻你
,They call me 混世拳王 我目标是重在参与

,This could be good for me
,Lately I was feeling like I need a purpose
,But when you talk to me
,Give me the impression that I won't scratch your surface
,And I could walk for days
,Searching for your praise
,But is it even there to find?
,Is there a chance for me to lend your memories?
,Will I slowly lose my mind?
,Lost in your maze
,Stuck in your gaze
,How can I get out?
,I'm out of time to make you mine
,Baby, show me how
,This could be good for me

,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin

,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,Now this is dedicated to the ones
,That lost their lives a little too early
,To the families out there still in pain
,I know that y'all are still hurtin'
,Losing loved ones, and ridas
,And sons no longer with us
,To the soldiers overseas
,Never coming home to they families
,We breathe but it really don't get no better
,They kinda went out too soon
,So much too live for still
,Just built a baby's room
,Last year he was the groom
,And now his soul is set free
,But still alive in your mind
,When you lay down to sleep
,They never really gone, take time like Cash said
,They livin' in our hearts
,I know it, I can feel him there
,They lookin' down upon us
,Guiding us through all the struggles
,Helping us to find all the pieces of the puzzle, yeah
,The pains double when it's someone so young
,But they gonna live through us
,So they can see how it's done, yeah
,All the tears, and the fun
,And everything in between
,We raise the glass in the air
,For the ones no longer seen
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,Life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
,Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
,The sharp knife of a short life, well
,Yeah, now I can't understand
,Why the Lord is taking these kids
,So many kidnappings and murders
,Right here right around where I live
,Let alone the rest of the world
,My heart goes out to that girl
,So R.I.P. little Caylee
,How could this happen to a baby?
,I get so sick of this place
,But I try to focus on the good
,But it's hard when you lose someone
,Way sooner than you probably should
,If I could, I'd take all the pain away
,No more funerals
,Or visting cemeteries on holidays
,I just wanna drift away
,From all the pain that we feelin'
,Man, it's been ten years
,Since Chris died, I'm still healin'
,One of the first dudes
,To push me in this rappin'
,I'll never forget, we shed so many tears
,So tragic, you and your brother passin'
,How could this happen?
,You still here though
,Everytime I'm layin' down a track
,Man, I gotta keep it crackin'
,I know this was your dream
,I do it for the ones that are no longer seen
,The sharp knife of a short life, well
,I've had, just enough time
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song

,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change

,留下的只有带着你味道的一封信
,就在昨天还一起看我们的照片
,可现在让我感觉像烂剧里的主演
,为什么这种事情会发生在我身边
,是不是老天没能看到对你的疯癫
,还想着创造你的宇宙
,但现在已经被我清空
,你让我整个人都冰冻
,还怎么再次为你心动
,Wake me 不是你的意愿
,离开我开始新的起点
,可能我还会对你贪恋
,谁让你曾经让我疯癫
,疯癫那也是过去的画面
,看往后的几天

,就像是要命的病变
,你可能听不见

,可能有点累觉得对不对
,这是第几次在为你宿醉
,没了我肩膀你在谁身旁
,买的礼物变成了灰
,曾经我多想把你变漂亮
,看着别人羡慕你的模样
,没关系有小熊陪Cubi看月亮
,我已经看到跟你断电的过程
,但我假装看不见
,是不是要我变得像个厉鬼

,这些年我对你的疯癫
,戴上那条围巾吗
,在每个寒风刺骨的冬天
,每次送你回家你抱着我
,不经意间又触碰到你的手
,你穿裙子眨眼睛望着我
,让我每次心动的瞬间
,那条十字路口
,始终有你身上的气味
,车水马龙过后的
,路灯下的身影又会是谁
,他想说我真的喜欢你
,但是每次欲言又闭嘴
,那时荒唐的男孩又浑浊了几岁

,
,You see-Zero didn＇t satisfy me
,A million didn＇t make me happy
,That＇s when I learned a lesson
,That it＇s all about your perception
,
,Hey-are you a papa or a superstar
,So you act, so you feel, so you are
,It ain＇t about the size of your car
,It＇s about the size of the faith in your heart
,There＇s hope
,It doesn＇t cost a thing to smile
,You don＇t have to pay to laugh
,You better thank God for that
,There＇s hope
,It doesn＇t cost a thing to smile
,You don＇t have to pay to laugh

,
,There＇s hope
,Off in the back country of Brazil
,A met a young brotha that made me feel
,That I could accomplish anything.
,You see just like me he wanted to sing
,He had no windows and no doors
,He lived a simple life and was extremely poor
,On top of all of that he had no eye sight,
,but that didn＇t keep him from seein＇ the light
,He said, what＇s it like in the USA,
,and all I did was complain
,He said-livin＇ here is paridise
,He taught me paridise is in your mind
,You know that
,There＇s hope
,It doesn＇t cost a thing to smile
,You don＇t have to pay to laugh
,You better thank God thatfor
,Every time I turn on the T.V. （There＇s Hope）
,Somebody＇s acting crazy （There＇s Hope）

,The government they keep on lying
,but we gotta keep on surviving
,Keep living our truth and do the best we can do

,I know I'm not the only one
,Who regrets the things they've done
,Sometimes I just feel it's only me
,Who can't stand the reflection that they see
,I wish I could live a little more
,Look up to the sky, not just the floor
,I feel like my life is flashing by
,And all I can do is watch and cry
,I miss the air, I miss my friends
,I miss my mother; I miss it when
,Life was a party to be thrown
,But that was a million years ago
,
,When I walk around all of the streets
,Where I grew up and found my feed.
,They can't look me in the eye
,It's like they're scared of me
,I try to think of things to say
,Like a joke or a memory
,But they don't recognize me now
,In the light of day
,
,I know I'm not the only one
,Who regrets the things they've done
,Sometimes I just feel it's only me
,Never became who they thought they'd be
,I wish I could live a little more
,Look up to the sky, not just the floor
,I feel like my life is flashing by
,And all I can do is watch and cry
,I miss the air, I miss my friends
,I miss my mother, I miss it when
,Life was a party to be thrown
,But that was a million years ago
,A million years ago

,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time
,The Void had been pushed back before by the power of mortals.
,The gods couldn’t do it,but maybe we can.
,What can yet be blessed can yet be restored.
,One way or another, divinity will survive.
,Divinity will survive...
,The gods are dead,long live the Godwoken.
,You have already unleashed some powers left within you, but there is the great well of possibility still untapped.
,You cannot stop until you ascend to the highest heights of your power.
,You cannot stop until you become divine.
,It is not the work effete,It is the work of devoid
,I am bound, but not defeated.
,Not yet...
,Until become divine
,Divine～
,Until become divine
,Divinity will survive
,Divinity will survive
,The Godwoken were alive, but what of the gods?

,Money is not evil by itself

作词 : Freese, Muggerud, Reyes
chorus：
(b real)
So you wanna be a rap/rock superstar, and live large
A big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world, don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
B real:
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
Looking in the mirror, dreamin about blowin up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honeys
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
It's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin with it
Nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you dont know
About the blood, sweat and tears
And losing some of your fears
And losing some of yourself to the years past,
Gone by
Hopefully it dont manifest
For the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Dont know how to act
48 tracks
Studio gangster, mack,
Sign the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap/rock superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who dont know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some cant pay the way
Still trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost
The route you took started collapsing
No fans no fame no respect no change no women
And everybody shittin on your name
Chrous x2
Sen: (only in rock version)
You ever have big dreams of making real cream
Big shot, heavy hitter on the main
And you wanna look trendy
In the bentley, be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be ok
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my lex with chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far
And live large
It aint all that goes with bein a rock star
Chorus x2
B real:
My own son dont know me
I'm chillin in the hotel room lonely
But i thank god i'm with my homies
But sometimes i wish i was back home
But only no radio or video didnt show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
I'm in the middle like mony
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight, never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the paladium (a venu in la)
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the ho's roll on
Til the next rap/rock superstar
With no shame
Give em a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin ignored, i warned him
Assured him, this aint easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin people (gun cock noise)
Whispered: assassins, assassins
Chorus x2
,Now excuse if I sound rude
,But I love the way that you move
,And I see me all over you now

,Yeah, but here's the only issue since we met
,You kinda turned my world upside down
,And I don't really mind spiderman kissing you
,As long as you're plagnning on sticking around
,The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
,Not a chance nobody came close to 'em
,I kinda knew you was troublesome

,Do you close the book and never read it again?
,Where do you go when your story's done?
,You can be who you were or who you'll become
,Oooh
,If it all goes wrong
,Oooh
,Darling just hold on

,
  Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
 Launch your assault now, take it easy
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
 One word and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart
 Rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
 Always number one
 The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
 Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
 Dropping your bombs now
 On all we've built
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart, rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
 Launch your assault now, take it easy
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
 One word and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart
 Rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
 Always number one
 The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
 Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
 Dropping your bombs now
 On all we've built
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over

,Like a spotlight the water hits me
,Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
,Though I know that no one's listening
,I nervously rehearse for when you're around
,And I keep waiting like you might change my mind
,Who wrote the book on goodbye?
,There's never been a way to make this easy
,When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
,Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
,Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
,Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
,Though I know that our time is ending
,I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
,And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
,Give me one more night
,Who wrote the book on goodbye?
,There's never been a way to make this easy
,When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
,Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
,No one knows（know）
,No one knows（know）
,We fell from the peak
,And the stars, they broke their code
,I'm trying to forget
,How I landed on this road
,I'm caught in between
,What I wish and what I know
,When they say that you just know
,Who wrote the book on goodbye?
,There's never been a way to make this easy
,When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
,Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
,No one knows（know）
,No one knows（know）
,No one knows（know）
,You set the other on fire
,You set the other on fire
,You set the other on fire
,You set the other on fire
,You set the other on fire
,
,Shotgun seat down an unknown road
,Wherever you go, boy I'm gonna go
,Favourite jam on the radio
,You're bobbing your head on cruise control
,We'll never be this young again
,The world is at our fingertips
,Don't know where we're going
,But my heart is open
,City lights arose the time with you I'll be just fine
,Nothing but the moment
,Boy you've got me floating up on cloud 9
,Yea so I don't really know when to call it falling, falling
,Cause I'm feeling, feeling so high
,The sun and you are just kissing my skin
,White tank top and a honey white grin
,One hand in yours one hand in the wind
,And if you wanna park, I'm cool with it
,Oh kiss me cross the console quick
,I'm loving this
,Don't know where we're going
,But my heart is open
,City lights arose the time with you I'll be just fine
,Nothing but the moment
,Boy you've got me floating up on cloud 9
,Yea so I don't really know when to call it falling, falling
,Cause I'm feeling, feeling so high, so high
,You open my door we run to the sand
,First one to get to the water wins
,It's kinda cold but we're jumping in
,Don't know where we're going
,But my heart is open
,City lights arose the time with you I'll be just fine
,Nothing but the moment
,Boy you've got me floating up on cloud 9
,Don't know where we're going
,But my heart is open
,City lights arose the time with you I'll be just fine

,Yea so I don't really know when to call it falling, falling
,Cause I'm feeling, feeling so
,Yea so I don't really know when to call it falling, falling
,Cause I'm feeling, feeling so high

,When it went down
,It was so hard to breathe
,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine~~~
,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine ~~~
