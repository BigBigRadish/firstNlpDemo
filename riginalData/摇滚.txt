,你在我脑海挥之不去babe
,那种迷恋无需猜测
,我说我应该学会换气babe
,因为我已经坠入爱河
,I fall in love

,因为你我变成了行走的情书
,听这些被荷尔蒙调戏的音符
,只要你一个眼神都值得庆祝
,和你一起的画面都像在银幕
,We r like a movie
,Like a movie
,你就是女主角
,我靠近你就只想把你的美看清楚点
,现实梦境难分辨
,有种特别的感觉
,来
,想和你谈个恋爱
,在这混乱的年代
,我们就突围突围
,穿过人群去宿醉
,吃定你没有除非
,让不开心全都枯萎
,他们都羡慕忌妒恨
,让这些刁民记住朕
,我们之间的默契就别过问
,我们的天造地设早被默认
,We do for love
,享受今天
,每一天都保持新鲜
,当我从你身后拥抱你就像是怀旧经典画面
,我心永恒没有别人

,当我爱你爱你胜过了爱我自己
,当我失忆失忆脑袋里面只剩你
,当我愿意愿意就算拥有不了你
,只希望哪怕某个时刻能够属于你
,你的美貌让我窒息
,情绪没法自理
,占据我的世界我的未来我的行动言语
,因为你我相信爱的神奇
,让我可以无所畏惧
,尽管让他们talking about me
,真的情话不是造句
,它点缀了真爱的行动派
,没爱的心胸窄
,如果没你我心中空白
,带你回梦中来
,你在我脑海挥之不去babe
,那种迷恋无需猜测
,我说我应该学会换气babe
,因为我已经坠入爱河

,已经熟悉那里的味道 弥漫青春的芬芳
,很多人在那里受过的伤 熬着自己的心灵鸡汤
,哭着在路边吐过 睡过也不觉得脏
,那时候的人们口中都没有谈论着爱情
,好像每一天阳光升起生活一切都可以归零
,街上的男孩眼神中没有一点的和平
,坐在可可清吧吃着旺角清粥的糯米鸡
,在浮游排队
,在苏荷策妹
,在城市英雄赛车队
,口里又说着谁谁谁玩消费联系哪个妹

,YOUNGJACK（满舒克）:
,Back2my城寨我依旧拉低裤裆刷街
,披金戴银的痞子人生当然充满花边
,老子从不屑谁的暗算我只喜欢花钱
,睁大你狗眼看清楚我们之间的差别
,我比你帅的不止一点
,比你帅的不止细节帅的不分季节
,帅的不分时间地点
,哥们的快乐源自历练
,兄弟都在这每天都纪念
,胳膊肘向外侧你还不要你碧莲
,都不配给老子提鞋
,我的生日在年底但我每天都在庆祝
,我的专辑卖的快因为我每天在进步
,我的团队rich and young天南海北的去派对
,我们马上做地主又有废柴要嫉妒
,没事我也没把你放我眼里
,不屑参加颁奖典礼
,买台跑车奖励自己
,我的格局不屑跟任何人比
,我的计划周密你也偷不走
,和我的SQUAD只会更富有
,一路风尘但我只懂得享受
,Hold up
,What a nice view
,What a nice view
,K9999（弹壳）:
,我们不在街上放逐
,但却同样讨厌叛徒
,所有跑江湖的招数早已练的滚瓜烂熟
,先让我的音乐能在每条街道播放
,然后告诉你我们曾在地下干的勾当
,年少多金但我从来不怕财富散尽
,兄弟交心让狐朋狗友也全都散去
,弱肉强食的世界如果只剩虚伪交际
,那红花会是你够信仰的唯一真谛
,被名利牢牢困住
,他们都乐此不疲的
,心中满是嫉妒愤怒却说自己被逼的
,看哥们风光度日
,兄弟们招摇过市
,别忘了我们从哪来的不怕孤注一掷

,那天晚上满天星星
,平行时空下的约定
,再一次相遇我会紧紧抱着你
,我只想现在告诉你
,我还在为你努力
,我为你写下每一首歌不管你在哪里
,重新在说声sorry
,对你也对我自己
,如果能再来一次
,我会说I love you baby

,但是在时光面前只有这样才算见证
,就算有那么一天你不再会为我微笑
,就算有那么一天你不再会为我流泪
,就算有那么一天我们变的陌生
,请你记住你的青春
,那样的爱才是天生
,当时我们还不知道什么是爱
,我喜欢上你可能就是觉得你可爱
,他们欺负你我就上前去帮他们欺负你
,第一次心疼你但第一次离你那么近
,我怕你恨我却又单独找你麻烦
,他们猜我喜欢你我说你们少来
,但我靠欺负你接近你毕竟不是办法
,小道消息说你喜欢学习好的那就这么办吧
,我开始熬夜看书然后五点起
,我开始问老师问题也许能碰到你
,考试及格变成我唯一接近你的捷径
,我做的这一切就是为了让你瞧得起
,我们开始聊天 我们开始传纸条
,我们开始一起放学 开始变得有话聊
,我越来越相信我们可以永远在一起
,我和自己说我一定要追到你
,或许我们之间会有不开心的争吵
,或许我们的生活没有梦中那么美好
,但是只有你在我身边这才最重要
,不管遇到什么风雨我们都不会跌倒
,不管再多挫折坎坷也能保持微笑
,我相信 我会成为让你安心的依靠
,我知道我们之间还有那么多的困扰
,但那真的无所谓只要有你在就好
,不想去想的太多思绪依旧那么潦草
,我答应给你一颗真心它纯度那么高
,我答应这辈子一定会陪你到老

,性に合わないみたいで
,洒落た言葉は一つも言えないけれど
,君を呼び出して空に叫んだあの日を思い出すよ
,はにかむ笑顔で恥ずかしそうに頷いていたっけな
,震える手をぎゅっと握り締めてもう一度伝えよう
,今でも変わらない僕の想いを同じ台詞で
,ついにその瞬間が
,近づいてきたようです
,此処まで来れたのはそう、君のお陰だ

,
,And to think that you would not be scared or surprised
,If I had severed all these ties
,This is the end
,
,I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight

,Prepare for the struggle, prepare to engage
,Our armor tight to the skin, this shield it bears his name
,We are strapped to the teeth
,But our swords are lodged tightly in our throats
,We are going under
,We cannot swim under these conditions
,We're drowning quicker and quicker
,We cannot swim, we cannot swim
,We can't swim under these conditions
,We are drowning quicker and quicker
,We cannot swim, we cannot swim under these conditions

,What if I wanted to break
,Laugh it all off in your face
,What would you do
,What if I fell to the floor
,Couldn't take all this anymore
,What would you do do do
,Come break me down
,Bury me , bury me
,I am finished with you
,What if I wanted to fight
,Beg for the rest of my life
,What would you do
,You say you wanted more
,What are you waiting for
,I'm not running from you
,Come break me down
,Bury me , bury me
,I am finished with you
,Look in my eyes
,You're killing me killing me
,All I wanted was you
,I tried to be someone else
,But nothing seemed to change
,I know now this is who I really am inside
,Finally found myself
,Fighting for a chance
,I know now this is who I really am
,Come break me down
,Bury me , bury me

,You took me home, I drank too much
,'Cause of you my liver turned to dust
,Cold rust takes, cold creeping cold pain
,Do you understand what I mean
,When you feel your soul drop to the floor
,Like a hole, like an open bleeding sore
,Then you'll have bled like I bled
,Then you'll have wept as I've wept
,Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
,Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
,One false move, you took me home
,One false move, you're all alone
,But it looks so good and it feels so nice
,I paid the price,
,I'll cut you out just to hear you scream
,Get away from, get away from me
,And I can feel my heartbeat racing
,as I realize what I must do
,But get away from, get away from,
,get away from you
,I should have turned and ran like hell
,Last time I got the taste of you
,I should have turned and ran like hell
,And I say we're through
,
,I should have turned and ran like hell
,Last time I got the taste of you
,I should have turned and ran like hell
,And I say we're through
,
,and I say we're through
,
,You fell upon me like a plague
,Weakness weak, weakness
,
,But I digress after all this
,
,You're just like all the rest
,Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
,Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
,One false move, you took me home
,One false move, you're all alone
,
,Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge?
,I bet you never had a Friday night like this
,Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
,I take a look up at the sky and I see red
,Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
,Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
,Everything red
,Please, won't you push me for the last time
,Let's scream until there's nothing left
,So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
,The thought of you's no fucking fun
,You want a martyr, I'll be one
,Because enough's enough, we're done
,You told me think about it, well I did
,Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
,I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
,I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
,Ahhh...
,The thing I think I love
,Will surely bring me pain
,Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
,Three cheers for throwing up
,Pubescent drama queen
,You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late
,Scream until there's nothing left
,So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
,The thought of you's no fucking fun
,You want a martyr I'll be one

,Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
,I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
,I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
,Imagine living like a king someday
,A single night without a ghost in the walls
,And if the bass shakes the earth underground
,We'll start a new revolution now
,(Now! Alright here we go)
,Hail Mary, forgive me
,Blood for blood, hearts beating
,Come at me, now this is war!
,Fuck with this new beat
,Oh!
,Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
,I was just a product of the street youth rage
,Born in this world without a voice or say
,Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
,I know you well but this ain't a game
,Blow the smoke in diamond shape
,Dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace
,You told me think about it, well I did
,Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
,I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
,I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
,Imagine living like a king someday
,A single night without a ghost in the walls
,We are the shadows screaming take us now
,We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground

i hope he takes your filthy heart in 
and he throws you away someday 
before you go, 
there's something you oughta know 
if you cant hang then 
theres the door baby (x3)

i met a girl stuck in her ways 
she found a boy shed knew she'd change 
i changed my clothes, my hair, my face, 
to watch us go our separate ways 
she said we'd grown apart for sometime 
but then she found somebody new 
i hope Mr. Right puts up with all the 
bullshit that you do

while i sit here by myself 
to figure out how i got this way 
before you go 
there's one thing you oughta know, 
if you can't hang then theres the door baby (x3)

i don't wanna get this confused 
she said she'd never 
settle for someone she couldn't use 
so now i gotta call the doctor 
so we can prescribe me medication 
so i can deal with all the memories 
of me and you this way
i met a girl at twenty three
she knew she meant the world to me, 
so i gave her everything 
and she did the same for me

, Doch geschaft hab' ich es nicht
, Ich wollte in Gedanken so oft flüchten
, Doch vor der Warheit kann kann niemand flieh'n

, Und es fühlt sich an wie ein Heimweh
, Denn ohne dich find' ich nicht mein'n Heimweg
, Ich hab' kein'n Kompass mehr
, Zurückzufinden fehlt mir so schwer

,That the ether I had tapped into could be reality
,It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
,Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind
,I don't need no sympathy. I won't cry and whine.

,And I'll shine when I wanna shine.
,Make their faces crack
,There's no turnin back.

,He's so mad' but he won't give up that
,Is he? No
,He won't have it ' he knows his whole back city's ropes
,It don't matter' he's dope
,He knows that' but he's broke

,When he goes back to his mobile home' that's when it's
,Back to the lab again yo

,Coast to coast shows' he's know as the globetrotter
,Lonely roads' God only knows
,He's grown farther from home' he's no father

,All the pain inside amplified by the fact
,That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
,And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
,Cuz man' these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
,And it's no movie' there's no Mekhi Phifer' this is my life
,And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder

,Too much for me to wanna
,Stay in one spot' another jam or not

Blink 182 times when you the Twista with Travis, madness
Kinda like a savage, ravage a murderer with the art like blood on the canvas

Diabolical, a lyrical flow that'll swallow you theoretical thinkin that you could get some.
Imma hit'em with the Lamborghini flow with the speed of a Bugatti

I'm from another planet when I spit a verse with the weed in my body. And Imma..
Hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth, sippin on the liquor 182 proof

Put an end to the image and i'll send it to 'em via independent fuckin with the mic grill
I might slip and pull the trigger back in a submarine with a sub-machine loaded,
in an ocean, hot deep, deep enough to leave submarine imploded
Promenade mothafucker vamanosis, its me and I'm sick in the prog(a)nosis,
got more bars than Barney Fife and I'll put you behind them like howdy opie
I can make your mamma really proud to know me, and your broke daddy is down to loan me.

Evolution is a mystery
A small change that no one sees.
Clock makes a fool of history .
Yesterday's so long ago, don't agree with what I know .
Tomorrow becomes a place to be.
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOLUTION
See my reflection change.
Nothing ever stays the same
But you know the name's the game.
We all know what it means
Nothings ever what it seems
Unforgiven
Unforseen
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOULTION
Take that hope

,Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
,I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m okay

,Moved to the city in a broke down car
,And four years, no calls

,And I can't stop, no, I can’t stop

,
, Legends never die when the world is callin' you
, Can you hear them screaming out your name?
, Legends never die
, They never lose hope when everything's cold
, And the fighting's near
, It's deep in their bones
, They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, They're written down in eternity
, But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives

,你爱过一个人吗
,你知道爱一个人什么滋味吗
,我今天就告诉你
,爱一个人很累很累
,你做的每件事都想讨他的欢心
,但是他根本不领情
,你会被他的若即若离而受折磨
,你会因为他跟别人的亲密而吃醋
,晚上你会因为思念和心痛睡不着觉
,一想到他眼泪就止不住的流下来
,就是因为这么一个人
,你突然发现
,你把身体里的自己已经掏空了
,那个时候你才明白
,你付出的所有感情在他看来根本就一文不值

,最后爱情是怎么一回事
,两个爱过的人变得
,不认识
,谁来急救
,没有感觉的彼此
,我在你的心中
,没有了位子
,到底爱情是怎么一回事
,太多的故事
,结局都是如此
,在每一个
,没有星星的日子
,往哪里指
,都是你影子
,窗外的麻雀在电线杆上多嘴
,你说这一句很有夏天的感觉
,手中的铅笔在纸上来来回回
,我用几行字形容你是我的谁
,秋刀鱼的滋味猫跟你都想了解
,初恋的香味就这样被我们寻回
,那温暖的阳光像刚摘的新鲜草莓
,你说你舍不得吃掉这一种感觉
,雨下整夜我的爱溢出就像雨水
,院子落叶跟我的思念厚厚一叠
,几句是非也无法将我的热情冷却
,你出现在我诗的每一页
,雨下整夜我的爱溢出就像雨水
,窗台蝴蝶像诗里纷飞的美丽章节
,我接着写把永远爱你写进诗的结尾
,你是我唯一想要的了解
,那饱满的稻穗幸福了这个季节
,而你的脸颊像田里熟透的蕃茄
,你突然对我说七里香的名字很美
,我此刻却只想亲吻你倔强的嘴
,整夜我的爱溢出就像雨水
,这夜里 路上行人好拥挤
,停在原地 不知如何走下去
,紧紧拥抱的你 深深爱的言语
,像电影散场 一幕幕分离
,陷落在最心底 沸腾不已
,夜夜 惊醒在空荡的梦里
,失去你失去勇气 失去意义
,谁记得分手那天 还下着雨
,曾经 做了约定说不放弃
,傻得可以 不留余地
,寂寞只剩自己 身不由己
,夜夜 惊醒在空荡的梦里
,失去你失去勇气 失去意义
,谁记得分手那天 还下着雨
,曾经 做了约定 说不放弃
,傻得可以 不留余地
,寂寞只剩自己 身不由己
,就算早知道结局 也许我仍会选择和你的命中注定
,明明 爱情本来就不公平
,只见新人笑的那些熟悉场景
,独留我伤情伤心 伤到最彻底
,一生也许再也没有也许
,何时纠结 会过去
,我丢了我自己 身不由己
,下雨天了怎么办 我好想你
,不敢打给你 我找不到原因
,什么失眠的声音
,变得好熟悉
,沉默的场景 做你的代替
,陪我听雨滴
,期待让人越来越沉溺
,谁和我一样
,等不到他的谁
,爱上你我总在学会
,寂寞的滋味
,一个人撑伞 一个人擦泪
,一个人好累
,怎样的雨 怎样的夜
,怎样的我能让你更想念
,雨要多大
,天要多黑 才能够有你的体贴
,其实 没有我你分不清那些
,差别 接近还能多一些
,别说你会难过
,别说你想改变
,被爱的人不用道歉

,她的微笑她的味道，从身体里发出暗淡的光

,它华丽地在我眼前飘过
,比想象中纯洁的爱情
,在清晨的**里奔跑
,胖子死在了回来的路上
,诶……什么是爱，诶……什么是爱
,诶……什么是爱，诶……什么是爱
,
,它在雾里面迷失了快感
,疯子似的以为自己还年轻
,胖子没有停止他的飞行
,因为落下的时候会发出巨大的声音
,诶……什么是爱，诶……什么是爱

,就让她随意寂寞吧
,就像我无所谓爱情
,一个人，一夜也开心

,别让她为你担心呀
,别像我错失了爱情
,一个人一夜夜伤心

,Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
,Engines pumping and thumping in time
,The green light flashes, the flags go up
,Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
,They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
,Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
,Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
,Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
,As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
,The fans get up and they get out of town
,The arena is empty except for one man
,Still driving and striving as fast as he can
,The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
,And long ago somebody left with the cup
,But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
,And thinking of someone for whom he still burns
,He's going the distance, he's going for speed
,She's all alone, all alone in her time of need
,Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
,He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
,He's going the distance
,No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
,He's haunted by something he cannot define
,Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
,Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
,In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
,She's hoping in time that her memories will fade

Hello there, my old friend
Not so long ago it was 'til the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
On our way up the road, we started over again
You're living a dream as though you're on top
My mind is aching, Lord, it won't stop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
Talking 'bout good thangs and signing the blues
You went your way and I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time
Living a dream as though you're on top
My mind is aching, Lord, it won't stop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
No waste of time, we're alive today
Turning up the past, there's no easier way
Time's been between us, a means to an end
God, it's good to be here walking together, my friend
Living a dream, my mind starts thinking
That's how it happens living life by the drop
That's how it happens living life by the drop
That's how it happens living life by the drop

,I've got an angel

,She wears a heart that could melt my own
,She wears a smile that could make me want to sing
,She gives me presents
,With her presence alone
,She gives me everything I could wish for
,She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
,She can make angels
,I've seen it with my own eyes
,You got to be careful when you you've got good love
,Cause them angels will just keep on multiplying
,You're so busy changing the world
,Just one smile can change all of mine

,For a lead role in a cage?

Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars
You're right about the moon
But you're wrong about the stars
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the way

This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the restaurant.
But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant, that's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the song, Alice's Restaurant.
You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
An' you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on Thanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and Fasha the dog. And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be. An' havin' all that room, seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.
We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red 
VW
microbus
, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.
Well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, "Closed on Thanksgiving." And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.
We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down.
That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie. He said, "Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of ab' a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it." And I said, "Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage."
After speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said, that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station. So we got in the red VW microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station.
Now friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at the police station, and the first was he coulda given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he coulda bawled us out and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said "Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on." He said, "Shut up, kid. Get in the back of the patrol car."
And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the quote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this happened here, they got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars, being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of
cop equipment that they had hangin' around the police officer's station. They was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and they took twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to mention the aerial photography.
After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put us in the cell. Said, "Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your wallet and your belt." And I said, "Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?" And he said, "Kid, we don't want any hangings." I said, "Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for litterin'?" Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice... Remember Alice? It's a song about Alice... Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back to the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.
We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down. Man came in said, "All rise." We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he sat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog. And then at twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry, 'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American blind justice, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that's not what I came to tell you about.
Came to talk about the draft.
They got a building down in New York City, it's called 
Whitehall Street
, where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. 'Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, "Kid, see the psychiatrist, room 604."
And I went up there, I said, "Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I wanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, Kill, KILL, KILL." And I started jumpin' up and down yelling, "KILL, KILL," and he started jumpin' up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down yelling, "KILL, KILL." And the Sargent came over, pinned a medal on me, sent me down the hall, said, "You're our boy."
Didn't feel too good about it.
An' I proceeded on down the hall gettin' more injections, inspections, detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they as doin' to me at the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no part untouched. Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and said, "What do you want?" He said, "Kid, we only got one question. Have you ever been arrested?"
And I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice's Restaurant Massacre, with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all the phenome... - and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, did you ever go to court?"
And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, I want you to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W .... NOW kid!!"
And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W's where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committin' your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly looking people on the bench there. Mother rapers. Father stabbers. Father rapers! Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me! And they was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly 'n' nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me and said, "Kid, whad'ya get?" I said, "I didn't get nothing, I had to pay $50 and pick up the garbage." He said, "What were you arrested for, kid?" And I said, "Litterin'." And they all moved away from me on the bench there, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I said, "And creating a nuisance." And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench, talkin' about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sargent came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said.
"Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say", and talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there, and I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the following words:
("KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?")
I went over to the Sargent, said, "Sargent, you got a lot a damn gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug." He looked at me and said, "Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints off to Washington."
And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a study in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I'm singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into the shrink wherever you are ,just walk in say "Shrink, You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant.". And walk out. You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and they won't take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them. And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an organization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day,I said fifty people a day walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. And friends they may thinks it's a movement.
And that's what it is , the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacree Movement, and all you got to do to join is sing it the next time it come's around on the guitar.
With feeling. So we'll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and sing it when it does. Here it comes.
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
That was horrible. If you want to end war and stuff you got to sing loud. I've been singing this song now for twenty five minutes. I could sing it for another twenty five minutes. I'm not proud... or tired.
So we'll wait till it comes around again, and this time with four part harmony and feeling.
We're just waitin' for it to come around is what we're doing.
All right now.
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant (Excepting Alice)
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
(I said) Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
Da-da da-da da-da da-dum
At Alice's Restaurant
,
,When I'm with you,
,It doesn't matter where we are,
,Or what we're doing.
,I'm with you, that's all that matters.
,Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing.
,I wish I could sing it to you, oh no.
,I wish I could sing it to you.
,Oh~~~~
,Mostly I'm silent.
,Never think about words to say.
,When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings.
,The color of chills all over my body.
,And when I feel them，
,I quickly try to decide which one.
,I should try to put into words, oh no.
,Try to put into words.
,Oh~~~~
,Mostly I'm silent.
,Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever.
,
,Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever.
,
,Only the beginning.
,Only just the start.
,I've got to get you into my life.
,Got to get you next to me.

,Then, as it was, then again it will be
,Though the course may change sometimes
,Rivers always reach the sea
,Flyin' skies of fortune, each have separate ways
,On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
,Kinda makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to go
,But as the eagle leaves the nest, he's got so far to go
,Changes fill my time
,Baby, that's alright with me
,In the midst, I think of you and how it used to be
,Did you ever really need somebody and really need 'em bad?
,Did you ever really want somebody, the best love you ever had?
,Do you ever remember me, baby? Did it feel so good?
,'Cause it was just the first time, and you knew you would
,Dewy eyes now sparkle, senses growing keen
,Tasted loves along the way, see your feathers preen
,Kinda makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to go
,We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul
,Vixen in my dreams, was a great surprise to me
,Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
,Oh, darlin', oh, darlin'
,Oh
,Oh, darlin', hey-yeah, oh, darlin'
,I'm never gonna leave ya
,I'm never gonna leave ya
,Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone

,I met her in a club down in old soho
,Where you drink champagne and it tastes like coca-cola
,C-O-L-A cola
,She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
,I asked her name and in a dark brown voice
,She said Lola
,L-O-L-A Lola
,la-la-la-la Lola
,Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
,But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
,Oh my Lola

,Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
,Why she looked like a woman and talked like a man
,Oh my Lola
,la-la-la-la Lola

,Well we drank champagne and danced all night
,Under electric candle-night
,She picked me up and sat me on her knee
,And said dear boy won't you come home with me
,Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
,But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell
,For my Lola

,Lola la-la-la-la Lola
,la-la-la-la Lola
,I pushed her away

,Then I looked at her and she at me
,Well that's the way that I want it to stay
,And I always want it to be that way
,For my Lola
,la-la-la-la Lola
,Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
,It's a mixed-up muddles-up shook-up world except for Lola
,la-la-la-la Lola
,Well I left home just a week before
,And I' d never ever kissed a woman before
,But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
,And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man
,Well I'm not the world's most masculine man

,We got in summertime
,Seemed like a breath of fresh air,
,Back in the summertime.
,When we were more like brothers,
,but that was years ago.
,So if it doesn t sing like a broken chord
,L
,I'm running out of heart today.
,I'm running out of open roads to you and
,I know, you are emoting and your days.
,Is something broke inside you, cause at the moment
,I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
,If I'm losing you again.
,Oh when we fly tomorrow,
,over the Java sea,

,'Cause they remind me of swimming
,out too far one day.
,Then, the cold was gone.
,But I didn't care anyways.
,I was running out of heart that day,
,I was running out of open roads to you and
,I know, I was emoting I was dazed.
,Is something broke inside me, cause at the moment
,I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
,If I'm losing you again.
,I'm running out of heart dear, you're just
,sitting out in the corn still doubting my day
,but I don't know what it is..
,I'll sweat it out the toxins. Is my
,Terracotta heart breaking? I don't know
,If I'm losing you,
,If I'm losing you again.

Just walking the street and what do 
I findPeople walking in the wrong way
Grab something to eat, praying to her
Baby, someday, somewhere
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling down again
She brings me the music
And my feet won't touch the ground, oh, again
Ah, logic can't prove it
And I don't know where 
I am bound
She brings me the music
And now I'm floating in her sound
And now I'm floating in her sound
I love this town but 
I'm flying home
You know I take a little on my way
Well, boys, it's been sweet, love and death
We deal with our shit in our own ways
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling in her grace
Man, she don't prove it
She just walks in a room, you just see her face
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling down again
She don't have to prove it'
Cause I'm falling in her sound
And I am a-falling in her sound
And I'm a-falling, falling, oh, baby
For you, falling, falling, oh, baby
Just a-calling you, calling you, oh, my baby
I'm a-calling, calling you, oh, yeah
Oh, I'm a-calling you, calling you, oh, baby

I'm just calling you, calling you all night
I'm just a-calling, calling, through the darkness
I'm a-calling you, calling you, oh, bring me home
I'm a-calling you, calling you, bring me home(I know I'm calling for you, now bring me home)
Take me home

,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on

,What will we do when we get old?
,Will we walk down the same road?
,Will you be there by my side?
,Standing strong as the waves roll over
,When the nights are long
,Longing for you to come home
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go

,Smoking cigarettes on balconies

,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,Need you on the other side
,
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,

Bernadette people are searchin' for
the kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
and never find the love I've found in you.
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
and I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend when all the time
they long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own
for just one moment we have known.
Bernadette they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette
when they can not control themselves Bernadette
from needing you wanting you
But darling you belong to me.
I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world you're the soul of me
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
the world is searching for
But you you give me the joy this heart of mine
has always been longing for.
In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore
that's why I treasure you and place you high above
for the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do Bernadette keep on loving me
Bernadette keep on needing me
Bernadette.
Bernadette.
Your the soul of me
more than a dream your a plan to me.
you mean more to me
than a woman was ever meant to be.

,Llega el fantasma de tu voz
,Diciéndome, no llores amor
,Soy un eslabón
,Que se ha perdido entre tú y yo
,
,Por favor solo llévate el silencio que quedó
,Fui fuego por ti
,Hoy solo quedan las cenizas
,Los restos de mí
,Fui todo y sin ti
,Desaparezco poco a poco
,Y me pierdo dentro de mí
,Fue frio el adiós
,La despedida de los dos
,Por favor solo llévate el silencio que quedó
,Fui fuego por ti
,Hoy solo quedan las cenizas
,Los restos de mi
,Fui todo y sin ti
,
,Desaparezco poco a poco
,Y me perdí
,A tu lado fui tan fuerte
,Nunca imaginé perderte
,No no nooo
,
,Fui fuego por ti
,Hoy solo quedan las cenizas
,Los restos de mi
,Fui todo y sin ti
,Desaparezco poco a poco
,Y me perdi dentro de mi
,
,No basta, traerlos al mundo porque es obligatorio
,Porque son la base del matrimonio
,O porque te equivocaste en la cuenta
,No basta, con llevarlos a la escuela a que aprendan
,Porque la vida cada vez es más dura
,Ser lo que tu padre no pudo ser
,No basta, que de afecto tu le has dado bien poco
,Todo por culpa del maldito trabajo y del tiempo
,No basta, porque cuando quiso hablar de un problema
,Tu le dijistes niño será mañana, es muy tarde
,Estoy cansado
,No basta, comprarle todo lo que quiso comprarse
,El auto nuevo antes de graduarse
,Que viviera lo que tu no has vivido
,No basta, con creer ser un padre excelente
,Porque eso te dice la gente
,A tus hijos nunca les falta nada
,No basta, porque cuando quiso hablarte de sexo
,Se te subieron los colores al rostro y te fuiste
,No basta, porque de haber tenido un problema
,Lo había resuelto comprando en la esquina
,Lo que había, lo que había
,No basta, con comprarle curiosos objetos
,No basta, cuando lo que necesites es afecto
,Aprender darle valor a las cosas
,Porque tú, no le seráis eterno
,No basta, castigarlo por haber llegado tarde
,Si no has caido ya tu chico es un hombre
,Ahora más alto y más fuerte
,Que tú, que tú
,No basta, no basta
,No basta, no basta
,No basta, no basta

,
,Me preguntaba
,Cómo sería besarte,
,Cómo sería llamarte,
,como seria llevarte de la mano a nuestro parque.
,Y me preguntaba,
,Si jugarías al fútbol como él,
,Si te parecerías a mí,
,Y si ella te cedería su dulzura también.
,Ahora lo sé,
,Sólo pregunto el por qué,
,Cómo en apenas segundos,
,Cuando te vi la cara,
,Te comencé a querer.
,Y sólo tú
,Haces que llore riendo,
,Haces que ría llorando,
,Y me pregunto cómo algo
,Tan peque?o puede invadir
,La caja de mis recuerdos,
,Los que ya apenas recuerdo
,Si tú no estás en ellos...
,Sólo tú.
,Y después de un tiempo,
,Ya pronunciabas mi nombre,
,Yo a todos se lo contaba,
,Para mí era importante.
,Y también, me encanta dormir contigo
,Y que a mitad de la noche,
,Sean las 3 o las 5,
,Busques siempre en mí cobijo.
,Porque sólo tú...
,Haces que llore riendo,
,Haces que ría llorando,
,Y me pregunto cómo algo
,Tan peque?o puede invadir
,Lo caja de mis recuerdo
,los que ya apenas recuerdo
,Si tú no estás en ellos...
,Sólo tú...
,Y como ya sabes,
,ABBA te escribió una canción,
,Pero ninguno de ellos,
,Te quería como yo.
,Porque sólo tú...
,Haces que llore riendo,
,Haces que ría llorando
,Y me pregunto cómo algo
,Tan peque?o puede invadir
,La caja de mis recuerdos,
,Los que ya apenas recuerdo
,Si tú no estás en ellos.
,Sólo tú, le das sentido a mis sue?os
,Y haces que ría llorando,
,Y me pregunto cómo algo
,Tan peque?o puede invadir,
,la caja de mis recuerdo
,los que ya apenas requerdo
,Si tú no estás en ellos.
,solo tu
,
,Me miras diferente
,Me abrazas y no siento tu calor
,Te digo lo que siento
,Me interrumpes y terminas la oracíon
,Siempre tienes la razón
,Tu libreto de siempre tan predecible
,Ya ya me lo sé
,Así que corre corre corre corazón
,De los dos tu siempre fuiste el más veloz
,Tóma todo lo que quieras pero véte ya
,que mis lágrimas jamás te voy a dar
,Así que corre como siempre no mires atrás
,lo has hecho ya y la verdad me da igual
,Ya viví esta escena
,Y con mucha pena te digo no,conmigo no
,Dí lo que podía,pero a media puerta se quedó,
,mi corazon
,Tu libreto de siempre tan repetido
,Ya no no te queda bién
,Así que corre corre corre corazón
,De los dos tu siempre fuiste el más veloz
,Tóma todo lo que quieras pero véte ya
,que mis lágrimas jamás te voy a dar
,Así que corre como siempre no mires atrás
,lo has hecho ya y la verdad me da igual
,Tu el perro de siempre los mismos trucos
,Ya ya me lo sé
,Así que corre corre corre corazón
,De los dos tu siempre fuiste el más veloz
,Tóma todo lo que quieras pero véte ya
,que mis lágrimas jamás te voy a dar
,Han sido tantas despedidas que en verdad
,Dedicarte un verso más esta de más
,Así que corre como siempre que no iré detrás
,Lo has hecho ya y la verdad me da igual
,Lo has hecho ya y la verdad me da igual
,Lo has hecho ya pero al final me da igual
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Siento que me desconoces
,Siento que tocarme ahora
,Te da igual, Te da igual
,
,Cada vez hay mas temores
,Crece como hiedra al aire
,Seguridad
,Y me lastima ver que intentas rescatar
,
,Lo que un dia en el alma nos unía
,Ya no está Aunque estas
,Es momento de afrontar la realidad
,
,Tú me quieres pero yo te amo
,Y esa es la verdad
,Tu presencia aquí me está matando
,De sentirte a la mitad
,Me cansado de intentar y no lograr
,Que te vuelva a enamorar
,Sé que no me quieres lastimar
,Pero tengo que solatarteeeeee
,Hoy te dejo en libertad
,
,No te odio no hay rencores
,Simplemente el corazón ya no esta
,tu corazón ya no esta
,
,Se han perdido los colores
,Ya tus manos no me tratan de buscar
,Y me lastiman ver que intentas rescatar
,
,lo que un dia
,En el alma nos unia
,Ya no estas Aunque estas
,es momento de afrontar la realidad
,
,Tu me quieres pero yo te amo

,
,
,
,
,
, Como es triste la ciudad de madrugada
, Caminando por las calles sin amor
, Oficinas con las luces apagadas
, Y vidrieras reflejando mi dolor
, Tu recuerdo está en el alma y siento frío
, Mi mundo vacío, vacío de amor
, Como es triste la ciudad de madrugada
, Cuando sientes que estás solo sin amor
, Cuando todo te da igual, no tienes ganas
, Cuando ves que todo es nada sin tu amor
, Los lugares si no estás no son lo mismo
, Y yo caigo en un abismo por tu adiós
, Como es triste la ciudad si tu me faltas
, Voy sin rumbo, sin ninguna dirección
, Tu recuerdo está en el alma y siento frío
, Mi mundo vacío, vacío de amor
, Como es triste la ciudad de madrugada
, Cuando sientes que estas solo sin amor
, Cuando todo te da igual, no tienes ganas... oh no
, Cuando ves que todo es nada sin tu amor
,Tu recuerdo está en el alma y siento frío
, Mi mundo vacío, vacío de amor
, Como es triste la ciudad de madrugada
, Cuando sientes que estas solo sin amor
, Cuando todo te da igual, no tienes ganas... oh no
, Cuando ves que todo es nada sin tu amor
, Cuando ves que todo es nada sin tu amor
, Como es triste la ciudad de madrugada, sin tu amor
Que falta poco
para volver a vernos
que no dejas de pensar en mi
que las
horas se te hacen tan eternas

que donde estás
amanece más temprano
pero sin mi nunca sale el sol
que por las noches tu sueñas con hacerme el amor

pero a pesar de lo que digas
y tu promesa de serme fiel
no me es fácil vivir
sintiéndome así

por que muero de celos
que alguien de ti vaya
a enamorarse
y te haga olvidarme
sabiendo que tu amor ya tiene dueño

y hoy muero de celos
que ese alguien llegue a deslumbrarte
y que quieras dejarme
y yo nunca más te vea regresar

que no has llamado
por que no tienes tiempo
que te fascina esa ciudad
y que no te has hecho de nuevas amistades

que ya no siga
controlando tus horarios
que de ti debo desconfiar
por que a mi lado tu has descubierto la felicidad
,
,No nesecito mas de nada
,ahora que
,me ilumino tu amor inmenso
,fuera y dentro
,Creeme esta vez
,Creeme por que
,Creeme y veras, no te aparamas
,Tengo un deseo escrito en alto
,que vuela aya
,mi pensamiento no detende de mi cuerpo
,Creeme esta vez
,Creeme por que
,Me haria daño ahora ya lo se
,Ay, gran espacio entre tu y yo
,Se lo advierto que ella
,no se cierra los dos
,pues saberlo lo que es necesidad
,Viveme sin miedo ahora que sea la vida una hora, no me dejas libre aqui desnudo
,Mi nuevo espacio que ahora es tuyo,
,Yo te ruego
,Viveme sin mas verguenza
,aunque este todo el mundo en contra
,deja la aparienca y toma el sentido
,y siento lo que llevo dentro...
,Y te transformas en un cuadro
,dentro de mi
,que cubre mis paredes blancas,
,sin cansadas
,Creeme esta vez
,Creeme por que
,Me haria daño una y otra vez
,Si, entre mi realidad
,hoy yo tengo algo mas
,que jamas tuve ayer
,necesitas vivirme un poco mas..
,Viveme sin miedo ahora
,que sea la vida sea una hora
,no me dejas libre aqui desnudo

,Si ayer tuviste un día gris tranquila
,yo haré canciones para ver
,si así consigo hacerte sonreir
,
,Si lo que quieres es huir camina
,
,yo haré canciones para ver
,si así consigo fuerzas para vivir
,No tengo más motivos para darte
,que este miedo que me da
,ya no volver a verte nunca más
,Creo ver la lluvia caer
,en mi ventana te veo pero no está lloviendo
,
,no es más que un reflejo de mi pensamiento
,
,hoy te echo de menos
,Yo sólo quiero hacerte saber
,amiga estés donde estés
,que si te falta el aliento yo te lo daré
,si te sientes sola háblame
,que te estaré escuchando
,
,aunque no te pueda ver
,aunque no te pueda ver
,
,De tantas cosas que perdí diría
,que sólo guardo lo que fue
,mágico tiempo que nació un abril
,
,Miradas tristes sobre mi se anidan
,
,se hacen parte de mi piel
,y ahora siempre llueve porque estoy sin ti
,No tengo más motivos para darte
,que esta fría soledad
,que necesito darte tantas cosas más
,Creo ver la lluvia caer
,en mi ventana te veo pero no está lloviendo
,
,no es más que un reflejo de mi pensamiento

,La tarde se aleja,
,el cielo está gris
,la noche aparece sin ti,
,callado en la playa, te lloro en silencio otra vez
,Me ahoga esta pena, no puedo vivir
,las olas no me hablan de ti
,sentado en la arena, escribo tu nombre otra vez
,Por que te extrano
,desde aquel Noviembre
,cuando sonamos juntos a querernos siempre.
,me duele, este frío Noviembre
,cuando las hojas caena morir por siempre..
,Noviembre sin ti ves sentir que la lluvia
,me dice llorando que todo acabó
,Noviembre sin ti
,es pedirle a la luna
,que brille en la noche de mi corazón,otra vez.. otra vez...

Llévame contigo al lugar
Donde no nos puedan ver
Ese día tiene que ser perfecto
Perfecto para comerte
Ahora ven hacia mí
Vamos a empezar a volar
Esta noche es solo tuya y mía
En tus brazos solo quiero estar
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que sueño con poder volar
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que duelo al miedo sin luchar
Voy a dejarme llevar
Solamente por ti
Voy a hacer que el cielo sea tu cama para dormir
Vamos corre sígueme vamos a empezar a volar
Las estrellas te saludan dejamos las nubes atrás
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que sueño con poder volar
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que duelo al miedo sin luchar
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que sueño con poder volar
Es por ti que cambio el mundo en un instante
Es por ti que duelo al miedo sin luchar

Ese hombre que te trae bien embrujada
Ese hombre gandalla deudor
Donde estas? vuelve mi amor
Que somos mar y arena
Ese hombre que se cree dueno del mundo
Te controla con dinero y sin amor
Donde estas? vuelve mi amor
Que somos mar y arena
Somos como mar y como arena
Tu eres vida que me oxigena
Te llevo hasta la venas por favor vuelve
Que me muero de la pena
Es que somos el mar y arena
Que te llevo en las venas
Por favor ya vuelve a mi
Embrujada enajenada
Hay quien vive en un error
Enganada atorada hay quien vive sin amor
Donde estas? 
Vuelve amor
Que somos mar y arena
El amor que nos unio es mucho mas grande
Mas de lo que nos quiere separar
Donde estas? 
Vuelve amor
Que si no vuelves, me voy, me voy a morir
Somos como mar y como arena
Tu eres vida que me oxigena
Te llevo hasta la venas
Por favor ya vuelve
Que me muero de la pena
Es que somos el mar y arena
Que te llevo en las venas
Por favor ya vuelve a mi
Voy a salir a la calle
Y gritar con fuerte voz
Y quitarme esa espina
Y pedirte mi perdon
Pedirte mi perdon
Dejemos el rencor
Somos como mar y como arena
Tu eres vida que me oxigena
Te llevo hasta la venas
Por favor ya vuelve
Que me muero de la pena
Es que somos el mar y arena
Que te llevo en las venas
Por favor ya vuelve a mi
Que me muero de la pena
Es que somos el mar y arena
Me rio, te lloro, te imploro
Tu dices que es lo que hago pa volver
Que te voy a ser sincero
Que sin ti, corazón, me muero
Que te llevo en las vena
Por favor ya vuelve a mi
Vete a un lado, quita el miedo
Quita todos, todos los rencores
Quita todos los rencores
Quita todos los temores
Quita todo, todo, amor, amor
Somos como mar y arena
Una pena, tus temores
Quita todos, todos los rencores

,Volver A Amar
,Tras el umbral de mis temores
,De mis errores, de mis fracasos
,Tras las heridas del pasado
,Y los amores ya olvidados
,Tras la inocencia que algun día
,Tras la ironía de aquellos a?os
,Sólo ha quedado un frío inmenso
,Y la espina cruel del desenga?o
,Llegas a mi vida como un sol
,Como la suave transparencia del amor
,Como el aroma de la brisa en la ma?ana
,Borrando para siempre mi dolor
,Volver a amar una vez más
,Nacer de nuevo en ti
,En tu mirar
,Llenando con tu luz
,Las sombras de mi soledad

El mira hacia el cielo, llorando bajito,
Le cuenta a una estrella, creyendo que es ella
Le tira besos, desde su ventana, y le pide a la luna...
Que cuando la vea, le diga al oído, que quiere tenerla durmiendo a su vera, con él en la cama tan fría y vacía... y llora de pena, que pena.
Y desde el día en que Dios, se la llevo, una lagrima espita en su corazón a el se le clavo.
Recuerda su voz, y tiembla al pensar cuando sueña de noche con ella, y se echa a llorar.
Abuelo, no llores que pronto vendrá la luna, y bajara del cielo una estrella, alumbrando el camino y allí estará contigo la abuela
Te esperara allí arriba en el cielo, y te dirá bajito te quiero, no quiero que me llores abuelo.
Solo, le queda el recuerdo como una condena, que lleva por dentro, y corre sus venas mirando una estrella que en cuatro paredes, se come sus penas
Solo tú siempre estas solo, digan lo que digan, te han dejado solo, como dice el dicho, tú cría cuervos y te sacarán los ojos, los ojos
Y desde el día en que Dios, se la llevo, una lagrima espita en su corazón a el se le clavo.
Recuerda su voz, y tiembla al pensar cuando sueña de noche con ella, y se echa a llorar.
Abuelo, no llores que pronto vendrá la luna, y bajara del cielo una estrella, alumbrando el camino y allí estará contigo la abuela
Te esperara allí arriba en el cielo, y te dirá bajito te quiero, no quiero que me llores abuelo(bis)

,
,
,A pesar de que la luna no brille mañana
,me dará igual sólo verte reír
,es lo que me hace feliz.
,mi alma...
,
,Y es verdad que una mirada distinta
,o algún gesto más frío se clava
,en mi pecho,
,daga del desconcierto
,pero amor ahí está la magia.
,
,Ahora que te veo niña
,ya te hecho de menos,
,no imagino mis heridas
,si algún día te vas lejos.
,
,Querría por esto...
,Que si preguntan por mi,
,no les digas donde fuí,
,que tu alma sea fuerte
,y cuando mires hacia el frente,
,no recuerdes todo lo que no te dí.
,
,Y es que quedan tantas cosas
,por contarte y que me cuentes
,tantos ratos y pasiones por vivir,
,a tu lado, oh mi vida...
,a tu lado...
,
,Y ojalá que nuestros ojos si brillen mañana,
,y que tu voz siga pidiéndome a gritos amor,
,a gritos de esperanza.
,
,Ahora que te tengo
,no pienso perder el tiempo,
,ni perderme por mi absurdo ego
,ni un solo momento,
,se esfuma, el miedo.
,
,Si preguntan por mi,
,no les digas donde fuí,
,que tu alma sea fuerte
,y cuando mires hacia el frente
,no recuerdes todo lo que no te dí.
,
,Que tu luz brille por siempre
,por que tu te lo mereces
,y perdona si algun día pretendí,
,que no fueras tu misma.
,
,Y si preguntan por ti
,sólo diré que te vi
,en mis sueños una noche
,y sólo sueños desde entonces
,para verme cada día junto a ti.
,
,Y es que quedan tantas cosas
,por contarte y que me cuentes,
,tantos ratos y pasiones por vivir,
,a tu lado, oh mi vida...
,a tu lado.
,
\"Donde quieras yo iré\"
Donde quieras yo iré
Al fin del mundo llegaré
Lo que quieras yo haré
Sin preguntas sin por qués.
El mundo entero he de caminar
Por sentir tus besos
Más alldel ancho mar
Que el sol, la luna, el cielo
Siempre que tu amor me lleve
No perderla fe que eleve
Mi espíritu en busca de tu amor
Donde quieras yo iré
Al fin del mundo llegar
Lo que quieras yo haré
Sin preguntas sin por qu
Tu amor por lo que puedo ver
Es lo que necesitare
Y algo que absolutamente sé
Que nena donde quieras yo iré
Solía pensar que el soñar
Es perder mi tiempo
Que nunca habría de encontrar
Cariño tan completo
Y en cuanto yo te conocí
Supe que eras para mí
Que sin tu amor no puedo ser feliz
- repeat
Eh! nena, mi cielo, mi vida... na oooh
Eh! nena, mi cielo
- repeat

,Perdona si hago de cuenta
,que no te he perdido
,Me duele aceptar que ya
,no estas conmigo
,Y no puedo dejar de pensar
,solo en ti...
,No se si algun dia
,sabras que te llevo conmigo,
,la vida no tiene
,razon ni sentido
,y no puedo morir
,si no estas junto a mi.
,Tengo tanta sed de ti
,que me cuesta respirar,
,o sera que en mi delirio
,te amo ms y ms....
,*Estn lloviendo estrellas
,en nuestra habitacin
,mojan de llanto mi corazn...
,Estn lloviendo estrellas
,a rededor de mi, y me preguntan
,que fu de ti...
,Quisiera llevarte muy dentro
,y llegado el momento
,entrar en el fondo
,de tus sentimientos
,y ver si te pasa
,lo mismo que a mi...
,Si acaso al estar junto a l
,le dijeras mi nombre,
,y estando en sus brazos
,mis besos se esconden,
,recuerdas las noches
,de amor que te d....

,
,Me muero por suplicarte que no te vayas, mi vida,
,me muero por escucharte decir las cosas que nunca diras,
,más me callo y te marchas,
,mantego la esperanza de ser capaz algún día
,de no esconder las heridas que me duelen al pensar
,que te voy queriendo cada día un poco más.
,?cuanto tiempo vamos a esperar?
,Me muero por abrazarte y que me abraces tan fuerte,
,me muero por divertirte
,y que me beses cuando despierte acomodado en tu pecho,
,hasta que el sol aparezca.
,Me voy perdiendo en tu aroma,
,me voy perdiendo en tus labios
,que se acercan susurrando palabras
,que llegan a este pobre corazón,
,voy sintiendo el fuego en mi interior.
,Me muero por conocerte, saber qué es lo que piensas,
,abrir todas tus puertas
,y vencer esas tormentas que nos quieran abatir,
,centrar en tus ojos mi mirada,
,cantar contigo al alba,
,besarnos hasta desgastarnos nuestros labios
,y ver en tu rostro cada día crecer esa semilla,
,crear, so?ar, dejar todo surgir,
,aparcando el miedo a sufrir
,Me muero por explicarte lo que pasa por mi mente,
,me muero por intrigarte y seguir siendo capaz de sorprenderte,
,sentir cada día ese flechazo al verte,
,?qué más dará lo que digan? ? qué más dará lo que piensen?
,Si estoy loco es cosa mía
,y ahora vuelvo a mirar el mundo a mi favor,
,vuelvo a ver brillar la luz del sol.
,Me muero por conocerte, saber qué es lo que piensas,
,abrir todas tus puertas
,y vencer esas tormentas que nos quieran abatir,
,centrar en tus ojos mi mirada,
,cantar contigo al alba,

, I wanna be the one you always can rely on
, Be the one to hold you through the night storm
, Be the gentleman that you need no matter how long
, I'm a fight until free
, find our freedom from defeat
, I wanna honor who you are, not try'na play on
, See the other guys you relied on
, They broke your heart but it grew strong
, We can be the perfect love song
, and watch the skies fall
, Wake up in the morning from the nights calm
, And see the sunrise while we stay tall
, Perfect intuition, you're my angel one I visioned
, that I always could envision
, To be wifey for my children cuz together we can fly
, Forever you and I on this mission
, That we call love that define all the wishes
, Yea I'm a gentleman for life
, Always need for a wife
, In this cold world, in this cold world
, I'll be the one to catch you
, when youre falling from the sky
, I'll be the one to hold you baby
, together we can fly
, Baby let's fly, baby you and I
, Baby hold on we can make it in time
, Baby let's fly, baby you and I
, Baby hold on we can make it in time
, I never told you how I love you
, kept my heart on the other side
, Looking for a safer ride, easier to say goodbye
, So bad when I want it but front when I lose it
, So I turn to the music
, And you turn to your phone
, and you wish what we had
, will remain in our home
, from the names we were call
, Never was a gentleman
, making scenes at the mall
, Yea just for the little things
, always was so ignorant
, Never thought the love
, that you bring was the best for me
, And you the smarter me
, I'm the loser in this tragedy
, In the ugly side, gently blinded me
, No romeo inside of me, to begin with be proud
, In my head would be time patient through the fights
, On this stage we call life, we can glide you and I
, Complicated from the start, so we aiming for the stars
, Start with the sentiment, I'm a gentleman
, I'll be the one to catch you
, when you're falling from the sky
, I'll be the one to hold you baby
, together we can fly
, Baby let's fly, baby you and I
, Baby hold on we can make it in time
, Baby let's fly, baby you and I
, Baby hold on we can make it in time

,总觉得外面世界有多美好
,用几滴眼泪才换来骄傲
,我要的光荣哪怕只有一秒
,角落太寂静城市太喧闹
,这世界很忙其实我都知道
,离开了地面就随风飘摇
,决定要走遍天涯心比天高
,我就像那一只林中的小鸟

,勇敢的张开双臂闭上了双眼
,远方离我只有一步之遥

,那带血的羽毛不向命运乞讨
,跌倒只能让我越飞越高

,And im addicted to your punishment
,And you're the master and I am waiting for disaster
,I feel irrational so confrontational
,To tell the truth again im getting away with murder
,It isn't possible to never tell the truth
,But the reality is im getting away with murder
,I take my drink and I don't even want to
,I think my thoughts when I don't even need to
,I never look back cos I don't even want to
,And I don't need to because im getting away with murder

,Getting Away - MURDER

,With eyes closed tightly,
,I march so blindly.
,Pretending everything's fine,
,'Cause you're there to keep me in line.

,I don't want your guidance,
,I'll break my silence.
,So sick of asking and being denied and now I realise.

,We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
,We were Born To Lead.
,We're finally free, no longer following,
,We were Born To Lead... we were Born To Lead.

,You can't ignore me （you can't ingnore me）
,You can't think for me （you can't think for me）
,Your world will come crashing down to the ground,
,'Cause I figured you out.

,We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
,We were Born To Lead.
,We're finally free, no longer following,
,We were Born To Lead... we were Born To Lead.
,
,I use to think I'm ALL alone,
,But now I see our numbers grow.
,I'm not afraid to break away,
,Think on my own
,
,With eyes wide open,
,My new life begins.
,Without you there to tell me, when, where and how,
,And you can't stop me now!

,We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
,We were Born To Lead.
,We're finally free, no longer following,

春节回家看爸妈

秋去冬来曾多少个轮回
独自一人漂泊在外却是如此狼狈
片片落叶它扶起了我的思念
传统的佳节就要到来

年迈的爸爸妈妈你们可好啊
天气凉了注意添些衣裳啊
问候少了你们请原谅吧
保重身体是孩儿的牵挂

无论我在海角天涯
带着我的希望一起回家
回到那个温暖的家
看看思念已久的爸和妈

今年春节回家看爸妈
多年没和你们唠唠家常话
多想吃你亲手包的那馅饺子
是多么的温暖和幸福

今年春节回家看爸妈
一家团团圆圆过大年
还有什么比这更留恋
外面生活何以再难言

,And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
,To tape off the scene of the slaughter
,Still can't swallow bread and water
,I don't know if they fags or what
,Search a nigga down and grabbin his nuts
,And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
,But don't let it be a black and a white one
,Cuz they slam ya down to the street top
,Black police showin out for the white cop
,Ice Cube will swarm
,On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
,Just cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
,A young nigga on a warpath
,And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
,Of cops, dyin in LA
,Yo Dre, I got somethin to say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident.>
,Fuck tha police and Ren said it with authority
,because the niggaz on the street is a majority.
,A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
,and the motherfuckin' weapon
,is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
,wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
,Lights start flashin behind me
,But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
,But that shit don't work, I just laugh
,Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
,To the police I'm sayin fuck you punk
,Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk
,Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
,With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
,But take off the gun so you can see what's up
,And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up
,Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
,But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
,I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
,But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
,Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
,Or any assho that threatens me
,I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
,Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
,The muthafuckin villian that's mad
,With potential to get bad as fuck
,So I'm a turn it around
,Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
,Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
,Takin out a police would make my day
,But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
,Fuck the police (4X)~~~~
,
,Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest.
,Get down and put your hands up where I can see em.
,Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor.
,and tell the jury how you feel abou this bullshit.>
,I'm tired of the muthafuckin jackin
,Sweatin my gang while I'm chillin in the shackin
,Shining tha light in my face, and for what
,Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
,I kick ass, or maybe cuz I blast
,On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigga
,Of any Uzi or an AK
,Cuz the police always got somethin stupid to say
,They put up my picture with silence
,Cuz my identity by itself causes violence
,The E with the criminal behavior
,Yeah, I'm a gansta, but still I got flavor
,Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
,A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot,
,By me, or another nigga.
,and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
,MC Ren: Sidle him, kid, he's from the old school, foo
,And as you all know, E's here to rule
,Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
,And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
,Dumb muthafucka with a gun
,And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be tha one
,That I take out, and then get away
,And while I'm drivin off laughin
,This is what I'll say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,
,whitebread, chickenshit muthafucka.
,Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie.

The only one I know
Has come to take me away
The only one I know
Is mine when she stitches me
The only one I see
Has found an aching in me
The only one I see
Has turned her tongue into me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

The only one I know
Never cries, never open her eyes
The only one I know
Wide awake and then she's away
The only one I see
Is mine when she walks down our street
The only one I see
Has carved her way in to me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before

,But I know just what it feels like
,To have a voice in the back of my head
,It's like a face that I hold inside
,A face that awakes when I close my eyes
,A face watches every time I lie
,A face that laughs every time I fall
,(And watches everything)
,So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
,That the face inside is hearing me
,right beneath my skin
,It's like I'm, paranoid lookin' over my back
,It's like a, whirlwind inside of my head
,It's like I, can't stop what I'm hearing within
,It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
,I know I've got a face in me

,In this farewell'
,there's no blood'
,there's no alibi.
,Cause I've drawn regret'
,from the truth'
,of a thousand lies.
,So let mercy come'
,and wash away...
,What I've done'
,I'll face myself'
,To cross out
,What I've become'
,Erase myself'
,And let go of
,What I've done.
,Put to rest'
,what you thought of me.
,While I clean this slate'
,with the hands of uncertainty
,So let mercy come'
,and wash away...
,What I've done'
,I'll face myself'
,To cross out
,What I've become'
,Erase myself'
,And let go of
,What I've done.
,For what I've done'
,I start again.
,And whatever pain may come'
,Today this ends'
,I'm forgiving...

,Today, we stood on the wall
,We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
,We laughed at it all
,
,And when they, they told us to go
,We paid them no mind, like every other time
,But little did we know
,Today, I look for a sign
,With flames in my hands
,A line in the sand
,Between yours and mine
,And it came, like fire from below
,Your greed led the call
,My flag had to fall
,But little did you know
,Another day, your truth will come
,You're gonna pay for what you
,Pay for what you've done
,You'll get what's yours
,And face your fraud
,You're gonna give me back what's mine
,Give me back what's mine!
,I ain't never been a coward
,I aint never seen blood
,You had sold me an ocean
,And I was lost in the flood
,We were counting on a leader
,We were driven by need
,Couldn't take temptation
,And we were blinded by greed
,You were steady as a sniper
,We were waiting on a wire
,So we never saw it coming
,When you ran from the fire
,You can try intimidation
,Or you can try to roar
,But when the time comes calling
,Yeah! You are gonna get yours!
,Another day, your truth will come
,You're gonna pay for what you
,Pay for what you've done
,And face your fraud
,Give me back what's mine!
,And so today, your truth has come
,You're gonna pay for what you
,Pay for what you've done
,You're out of time
,And you will give me back what's mine
,give me back what's mine!
,give me  give me back what's mine!

,What's mine!
,What's mine!

,Forcefully, the power of suggestion

,Until the sun rises up

,Moving all around screaming of the ups and downs
,Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
,The wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the
,Street lamps, chain-link and concrete
,A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats
,On down the street till the wind is gone

,When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

,Won't  forget  how  I  got  this  far
,and  every  time  saying:
,In  these  promises  broken/deep  below.
,Each  word  gets  lost  in  the  echo.
,So  one  last  lie  I  can  see  through
,This  time  I  finally  let  you  go.
,
,I’m feelin’ trapped inside this house,
,The words I want, they won’t come out,
,Feel like a ghost inside these walls,
,It’s like no one sees me at all
,I want to say, what I want to say,
,And hope no fear gets in the way,
,But whether I succeed or not,
,Help me heal this broken heart
,When everything seems crazy,
,And I don’t know If I can take it,
,I know, I need a little more help
,Than I’ve ever had,
,And a little more love than I’ve had yet
,When everything feels shaken,
,And I don’t know if I can make it,
,I know, I need a little more faith,
,Than if I believe,
,‘Cause every step I take,
,You’re breaking me again
,I get so lost inside my head,
,I’m saying things I’ve never said,
,The prayers I want,
,They won’t come out,
,A war between confidence,
,And doubt
,I want to say, what I want to say,
,And hope no fear gets in the way,
,But whether I succeed or not,
,Help me heal this broken heart
,When everything seems crazy,
,And I don’t know If I can take it,
,I know, I need a little more help
,Than I’ve ever had,
,And a little more love than I’ve had yet
,When everything feels shaken,
,And I don’t know if I can make it,
,I know, I need a little more faith,
,Than if I believe,
,‘Cause every step I take,
,You’re breaking me again
,Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh,
,Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh,
,When everything seems crazy,
,And I don’t know If I can take it,

,Saying I love you
,Is not the words I want to hear from you
,It's not that I want you
,Not to say, but if you only knew
,How easy it would be to show me how you feel
,More than words is all you have to do to make it real
,Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
,Cos I'd already know
,What would you do if my heart was torn in two
,More than words to show you feel
,That your love for me is real
,What would you say if I took those words away
,Then you couldn't make things new
,Just by saying I love you
,More than words
,Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
,All you have to do is close your eyes
,And just reach out your hands and touch me
,Hold me close don't ever let me go
,More than words is all I ever needed you to show
,Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
,Cos I'd already know

,Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
,The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
,And all the tears you cried, that called my name
,And when you needed me I came through
,I paint a picture of the days gone by
,When love went blind and you would make me see
,I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
,So that I knew you were there for me
,Time after time you were there for me
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,We spend the summer with the top rolled down
,Wished ever after would be like this
,You said I love you babe, without a sound
,I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
,I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,We've had our share of hard times
,But that's the price we paid
,And through it all we kept the promise that we made
,I swear you'll never be lonely
,Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
,Washed away a dream of you
,But nothing else could ever take you away
,'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
,Oh my darling, I love you
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day

,She's got a smile that it seems to me
,Reminds me of childhood memories
,Where everything
,Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
,Now and then when I see her face
,She takes me away to that special place
,And if I stared too long
,I'd probably break down and cry
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,She's got eyes of the bluest skies
,As if they thought of rain
,I hate to look into those eyes
,And see an ounce of pain
,Her hair reminds me
,Of a warm safe place
,Where as a child I'd hide
,And pray for the thunder
,And the rain
,To quietly pass me by
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now

,Through this world without having you
,I just wouldn't have a clue
,'Cause sometimes it seems
,Like this world's closing in on me'
,And there's no way of breaking free
,And then I see you reach for me
,Sometimes I wanna give up
,I wanna give in' I wanna quit the fight
,And then I see you' baby

,What a touch of your hand can do
,It's like nothing that I ever knew
,And when the rain is falling
,I don't feel it' 'cause you're here with me now
,And one look at you baby

, When you make love,
, do you look in the mirror?
, Who do you think of?
, Does he look like me?
, Do you tell lies?
, And say that it's forever?
, Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?
, Ooh babe
, When you're alone, do you let go?
, Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show?
, Ooh c'mon
, I don't wanna touch you too much baby

,When I look into your eyes
,I can see a love restrained
,But darlin' when I hold you
,Don't you know I feel the same
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever
,And we both know hearts can change
,And it's hard to hold a candle
,In the cold November rain
,We've been through this such a long long time
,Just tryin' to kill the pain
,But lovers always come and lovers always go
,An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
,Walking away
,If we could take the time to lay it on the line
,I could rest my head
,Just knowin' that you were mine
,All mine
,So if you want to love me
,then darlin' don't refrain
,Or I'll just end up walkin'
,In the cold November rain
,Do you need some time...on your own
,Do you need some time...all alone
,Everybody needs some time...on their own
,Don't you know you need some time...all alone
,I know it's hard to keep an open heart
,When even friends seem out to harm you
,But if you could heal a broken heart
,Wouldn't time be out to charm you
,Sometimes I need some time...on my own
,Sometimes I need some time...all alone
,Everybody needs some time...on their own
,Don't you know you need some time...all alone
,And when your fears subside
,And shadows still remain
,I know that you can love me
,When there's no one left to blame
,So never mind the darkness
,We still can find a way
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever
,Even cold November rain
,Don't ya think that you need somebody
,Don't ya think that you need someone
,Everybody needs somebody
,You're not the only one
,You're not the only one

,I guess the time was right for us to say
,We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day
,We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
,We know our dreams can all come true
,With love that we can share
,With you I never wonder
,Will you be there for me
,With you I never wonder
,You're the right one for me
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,A love to last my whole life through
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,Forever in my heart
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,With every kiss our love is like brand-new
,And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
,Still we both know that the road is long
,(But) we know that we will be together
,Because our love is strong
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,A love to last my whole life through
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,Forever in my heart
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,A love to last my whole life through
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,Forever in my heart

Blow a kiss from your hand,

Cry a little for our fears Baby Baby,

Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming...Oh...
I know I caused you so much pain,
I promise that I'll never hurt you again.
Even though the scars remain,
With a little time I know, We can win,
can't stop this ride,
Lost control of my desire,
Still it burns for you,
Like it always used to do.
Anytime Anytime you want me,
Anytime Anytime you're lonely,
You just have to call,
'Cause you know I'll be there.

Anytime Anytime, you need me,

Anytime Anytime you're lonely,
You just have to call,

Verse 1 Time seemed to pass me by 
I found myself alone, wondering why 
Then you came into my life 
And gave your love to me 
You are the one 
That showed me the way 
In my heart you'll stay 
Chorus And 
I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever it will be 
You and me together 
Bridge I want your love forever 
I need your love 
You're the only one 
That fills my heart 
And I love you 
More and more everyday 
Chorus 2 And 
I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever it will be you and me 
I will sing to you and all you do 
Always and forever it will be you and me together
,You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
,There was something missing
,You should've known by the tone a' my voice, maybe
,But you didn't listen
,You played dead, but you never bled,
,Instead you lay still in the grass, all coiled up and hissing
,And though I know all about those men
,Still I don't remember
,Cause it was us, baby, ready for them
,And we're still together
,And I meant, every word I said
,When I said that I love you, I meant that I'd love you forever
,And I'm gonna keep on loving you
,Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep
,I just wanna keep on loving you
,And I meant, every word I said
,When I said that I love you, I meant that I'd love you forever
,And I'm gonna keep on loving you
,Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep
,I just wanna keep on loving you
,Baby I'm gonna keep on loving you
,'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you

,You can see the world you brought to life
,To life
,So love me like you do
,Love me like you do
,Love me like you do
,Touch me like you do
,Touch me like you do
,what are you waiting for?
,Fading in, fading out
,On the edge of paradise
,Every inch of your skin is a holy gray I've got to find
,I've got to find
,Only you can set my heart on fire
,On fire
,I'll let you set the pace
,Cause I'm not thinking straight
,My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
,what are you waiting for?
,On a dark desert highway
,Cool wind in my hair
,Warm smell of colitas
,Rising up through the air
,Up ahead in the distance
,I saw a shimmering light
,My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
,I had to stop for the night
,There she stood in the doorway
,I heard the mission bell
,And I was thinking to myself
,This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
,Then she lit up a candle
,And she showed me the way
,There were voices down the corridor
,I thought I heard them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Plenty of room at the Hotel California
,Any time of year
,Any time of year (background)
,You can find it here
,Her mind is Tiffany twisted
,Shes got the Mercedes bends
,Shes got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
,That she calls friends
,How they dance in the courtyard
,Sweet summer sweat
,Some dance to remember
,Some dance to forget
,So I called up the Captain
,Please bring me my wine
,He said
,We havent had that spirit here since 1969
,And still those voices are calling from far away
,Wake you up in the middle of the night
,Just to hear them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely Place
,Such a lovely Place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Theyre livin it up at the Hotel California
,What a nice surprise
,What a nice surprise (background)
,Bring your alibies
,Mirrors on the ceiling
,Pink champagne on ice
,And she said
,We are all just prisoners here
,Of our own device
,And in the masters chambers
,They gathered for the feast
,They stab it with their steely knives
,But they just cant kill the beast
,Last thing I remember
,I was running for the door
,I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
,Relax said the nightman
,We are programed to receive
,You can check out any time you like
,But you can never leave

,that grow so incredibly high.
,Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
,waiting to take you away.
,Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
,and you're gone.

,I saw the photograph.
,He blew his mind out in a car,
,He didn't notice that the lights have changed,
,A crowd of people stood and stared,
,They've seen his face before,
,Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.

,The English army had just won the war,
,A crowd of people turned away,
,But I just had a look,
,Having read a book, I'd like to turn you on...
,Woke up, fell out of bed,
,dragged a comb across my head,
,found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
,and looking up I noticed I was late.
,Found my coat and grabbed my head,
,made the bus in second flat,
,found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
,and somebody spoke and I went into a dream
,I read a news today, oh boy,
,four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire,

,Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

,And I noticed there wasn't a chair
,I sat on a rug biding my time
,drinking her wine
,We talked until two and then she said

,She told me she worked
,in the morning and started to laugh
,I told her I didn't

,There are places I'll remember
,All my life though some have changed
,Some forever not for better
,Some have gone and some remain
,All these places have their moments
,With lovers and friends I still can recall
,Some are dead and some are living
,In my life I've loved them all
,But of all these friends and lovers
,There is no one compares with you
,And these memories lose their meaning
,When I think of love as something new
,Though I know I'll never lose affection
,For people and things that went before
,I know I'll often stop and think about them
,In my life I love you more

,7년을 만났죠 아무도 우리가
,이렇게 쉽게 이별할 줄은 몰랐죠
,그래도 우리는 헤어져 버렸죠 긴 시간 쌓아왔던 기억을 남긴 채
,우린 어쩜 너무 어린 나이에 서로를 만나 기댔는지 몰라
,변해가는 우리 모습들을 감당하기 어려웠는지도
,이별하면 아프다고 하던데 그런 것도 느낄 수가 없었죠
,그저 그냥 그런가 봐 하며 담담했는데
,울었죠 우우우 시간이 가면서 내게 준
,아쉬움에 그리움에 내 뜻과는 다른 나의 맘을 보면서
,처음엔 친구로 다음에는 연인 사이로
,헤어지면 가까스로 친구 사이라는 그 말 정말 맞는데
,그 후로 3년을 보내는 동안에도
,가끔씩 서로에게 연락을 했었죠
,
,다른 한 사람을 만나 또 다시 사랑하게 되었으면서도
,난 슬플 때면 항상 전활 걸어 소리 없이 눈물만 흘리고
,너도 좋은 사람 만나야 된다 마음에도 없는 말을 하면서
,아직 나를 좋아하나 괜히 돌려 말했죠
,알아요 우우우 서로 가장 순수했었던
,그 때 그런 사랑 다시 할 수 없다는 걸 추억으로 남을 뿐
,가끔씩 차가운 그 앨 느낄 때도 있어요
,하지만 이제는 아무 것도 요구할 수 없다는 걸 잘 알죠
,나 이제 결혼해 그 애의 말 듣고
,한참을 아무 말도 할 수가 없었죠
,그리곤 울었죠 그 애 마지막 말
,사랑해 듣고 싶던 그 한마디 때문에

,I let it fall, my heart
,And as it fell, you rose to claim it
,It was dark and I was over
,Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
,My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak
,To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
,But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
,All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
,And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
,But I set fire to the rain
,Watched it pour as I touched your face
,Well, it burned while I cried
,'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
,I set fire to the rain
,And I threw us into the flames
,When we fell, something died
,'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
,Cursing me boy you played through my mind like a symphony
,There's no way to describe what you do to me
,You just do to me what you do
,And it feels like I've been rescued
,I've been set free
,I am hyptonized by your destiny
,You are magical,lyrical,beautiful
,You are and I want you to know baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,I I love you like a love song baby
,And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat
,I set fire to the rain
,And I threw us into the flames
,When we fell, something died
,'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
,Sometimes I wake up (No one can pause)by the door
,(You stand alone to every record I own)
,That heart you caught must be waiting for you
,Even now when we're already over(Music to my hear )
,I can't help myself from looking for you(that's what you are ,a song that goes on and on)
,I set fire to the rain(I I love you like a love song baby)
,Watched it pour as I touch your face(I I love you like a love song baby)
,Well, it burned while I cried(I I love you like a love song baby)
,'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name(And I keep it in re-pe-pe-peat)

,I thought I found a love but she was just a fling.
,And then I'm a girl,
,and felt a different thing.
,It's like your hit in the ring like you're pulled by a string.
,Can't breathe like you're choking on a chicken wing.
,It was a thing called a zing.
,And I wanted to sing,
,and listen to the ballads of a man named Sting.
,Baby, looks in your eye.
,And it's suddenly spring like when Nala kissed Simba in the lion king.
,Zinging in the air and I don't have a care.
,I'm winging from the zing that we share.
,Zinging in the rain.
,Now I'm feeling no pain.
,It's real, time for celebrating cause you're my zing.
,（Drag, ready to throw down?
,No,
,no I just came closer to hear you better.
,Oh, come on!
,Just give it a try.
,Alright.
,Maybe just a little bit）.
, So listen all you zingers from here on
,cause if love was money,
,You better grab a box of strings and get ready to cling
,you'd better be yelling "cha - ching",
,cause next to zing,
,cupid's arrow's a little bee sting,
,it was a zing and a zang and a ziygididy and there was one only one
,lady in the zing for me cause when you zing （when you zing）!
,You better know one little thing: the only thing you're gonnna sling is a wedding ring!
,Zinging in the air.
,Now I don't have a care.
,I'm winging from the zing that we share.
,Zinging in the rain.
,Now I'm feeling no pain.
,It's a real time for celebrating cause you're my zing.
,To the zing y'all, ba-da-bing y'all.
,Gonnna knock you out right outta that ring y'all.
,Better ring y'all, happening y'all.
,Pay attention to the undead king, y'all!
,Oh!

,With your funny voice and that small koala nose of yours
,I guess good things werent meant to last
,Because you were by my side
,But now its just all in the past
,Was more than just love and trust
,All the things that stood between us
,I guess youd agree were better off how we are now
,But when you tell me all the terrible things
,That are happening in your life
,Something feels weird and its hurting me deep inside
,And it cuts me like a knife
,
,You dont deserve all the things youre going through
,And the more you cry, the more Im dying deep down inside
,Its killing my heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat, heartbeat

,Did we build all those bridges
,To watch them thin down to dust
,
,Or blow them voluntarily
,
,Out of constant trust
,
,The clock is ticking it's last couple of tocks
,
,And there won't be a party

,The shadow grows
,
,Without ever slowing down
,
,We are heading straight
,
,Into the fade out line
,
,
,And I'd give up forever to touch you,
,Cause I know that you feel me somehow.
,You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be,
,And I don't want to go home right now.
,And all I can taste is this moment,
,And all I can breathe is your life,
,And sooner or later it's over,
,I just don't want to miss you tonight.
,And I don't want the world to see me,
,Cause I don't think that they'd understand.
,When everything's made to be broken,
,I just want you to know who I am.
,And you cant fight the tears that ain't coming,

,Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive.

,Paint yourself a picture
,Of what you wish you looked like
,Maybe then they just might
,Feel an ounce of your pain
,Come into focus
,Step out of the shadows
,It's a losing battle
,There's no need to be ashamed
,Cause they don't even know you
,All they see is scars
,They don't see the angel
,Living in your heart
,Let them find the real you
,Buried deep within
,Let them know with all you've got
,That you are not your skin
,When they start to judge you
,Show them your true colors
,And do one to others
,As you'd have done to you
,Just rise above this
,Kill them with your kindness
,Ignorance is blindness
,They're the ones that stand to lose
,Cause they don't even know you
,All they see is scars
,They don't see the angel
,Living in your heart
,Let them find the real you
,Buried deep within
,Let them know with all you've got
,That you are not your skin
,Well they don't even know you
,All they see is scars
,And they don't see the angel
,Living in your heart
,So let them find the real you
,Buried deep within
,Let them know with all you've got
,That you are not
,You are not your skin

,When I was younger, so much younger than today
,I never needed anybody's help in any way
,But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
,Now I find I've changed my mind
,I've opened up the doors
,Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
,And I do appreciate you being 'round
,Help me get my feet back on the ground
,Won't you please, please help me
,
,And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
,My independence seems to vanish in the haze
,But every now and then I feel so insecure
,I know that I just need you like
,I've never done before
,Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
,And I do appreciate you being 'round
,Help me get my feet back on the ground
,Won't you please, please, you got to help me now

,
,I've been here before, now here I am again
,Standing at the door, praying You'll let me back in
,To label me a prodigal would be
,Only scratching the surface of who I've been known to be
,
,Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
,Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
,I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
,You're the only one who can undo what I've become
,
,I focused on the score but I can never win
,Trying to ignore a life of hiding my sin
,To label me a hypocrite would be
,Only scratching the surface of who I've been known to be, yeah
,Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
,Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
,I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
,You're the only one who can undo what I've become
,Make every step lead me back to the sovereign way that You
,Turn me around, pick me up, undo what I've become
,Bring me back to the place of forgiveness and grace
,I need You, I need Your help, I can't do this myself
,Jesus, You're the only one who can undo
,You are the only one who can undo

,Listen, birds don't sing anymore
,Waves don't crash on the shore
,'Cause You don't love me anymore
,See, the morning sun doesn't shine
,And the moon's nowhere to find
,'Cause You don't love me anymore
,Then I realize I'm Alive, I'll survive
,I was only dreaming that our love died

,Angel'put sad wings around me now
,Protect me from this world of sin
,So that we can rise again
,Oh angel - we can find our way somehow
,Escaping from the world we're in
,To a place where we began
,And I know we'll find
,A better place and peace of mind
,Just tell me that it's all you want
,for you and me
,Angel won't you set me free
,Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
,Then reaching for the stars at night
,As our lives had just begun
,When I close my eyes
,I hear your velvet wings and cry
,I'm waiting here with open arms
,oh can't you see
,Angel shine your light on me
,Oh angel will we meet once more - I'll pay
,When all my sins are washed away
,Hold me inside your wings and stay
,Oh! Angel take me away
,Put sad wings around me now
,Angel take me far away
,Put sad wings around me now
,So that we can rise again
,Put sad wings around me now
,Angel take me far away
,Put sad wings around me now
,So that we can rise again
,
, You, you and I
, In the spell of the night
, The butterflies they dream
, Just to feel what we've seen
, To be lost in the beauty of love
, And you say that you'll
, Never forget of its flame
, And you'll hold to its warmth, all our days
, Days turn to years and the cobwebs appears.
, The memories they fade
, All the moments we made
, And we feel only ashes remain
, And we fought through the tears
, Hoping light may appear
, So my dear
, Will you keep me tonight?
, So lover
, Will you carry my heart?
, Will you carry my scars?
, Will you carry my soul?
, So lover
, Will you carry my heart?
, Will you carry my scars?
, Will you carry my soul?
, So for me, will you stay?
, And remember this flame
, As it burns to the end of our days
, So lover
, Will you carry my heart?
, Will you carry my scars?
, Will you carry my soul?
, So lover
, Will you carry my heart?
, Will you carry my scars?
, Will you carry my soul?
,It's not the world that's out of order
,It's me, it's me
,Guess I ran along my borders
,Just to see, just to see
,
,If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me
,But I lost my faith as I lost my way
,
,It's not the street that's made of concrete
,It's you, it's you
,Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view
,I had never taken more than I give to you
,I was led astray and I lost my way
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,It's not the light that casts the shadow
,It's doubt, it's doubt
,As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about
,
,I had never fought as hard though as I do for you
,I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,And god sent an angel
,An angel
,She's an angel
,An angel...
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,God sent an angel
,Sent an angel
,She's an angel
,An angel
,She's an aaaa... an angel
,
,It's not my life that's obsolete
,It's youth, my youth
,Guess it took a while for me to see the truth, see the truth
,I got stuck in minor details so I missed the point
,I got so much more than I bargained for...
,
,
,I think you could help me
,get back to the world
,I'm spinning out of control
,Help me, I'm drifting alone
,I'm sinking , I need you to hold
,
,I'd do anything to hear you say
,That you're gonna take the pain away
,I just need you back in my arms
,
,'Cause I , I tried
,I do my best to reach you
,'Cause I'm drowning in this flood
,Tonight, I cry
,'Cause my world is gone to pieces
,And I can't get close enough
,To touch
,
,Save me, I'm losing myself
,I'm falling I need nobody else

,
,Another day, I lose direction
,Memories of yesterday, their call
,Keeps me feeling small
,
,I used to feel the sweet conviction
,Now I walk to crucifiction
,Please wont you catch me when I fall
,
,But I can't take this screaming anymore
,Still there's nothing like your kisess
,I recall
,
,You know I'm trying, denying
,That you don't love me anymore
,You've closen all your doors
,Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
,To find a way back to your heart
,But I break before I start
,
,I can't live up, to expectations
,Now you leave your resignation
,I, will miss you when you're gone
,
,I guess, you can't take
,This screaming anymore
,Remember all my kisses like before
,
,You know I'm trying, denying
,That you don't love me anymore
,You've closen all your doors
,Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
,To find a way back to your heart
,But I break before I start
,
,I know I can't refuse the call
,And your silence says it all
,It's over, don't leave me standing here
,Ooohhhh
,You know I'm trying, denying
,That you don't love me anymore
,You've closen all your doors
,Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
,To find a way back to your heart
,But I break before I start
,
,You know I'm trying, denying (I can feel your sweet conviction,now I walk to crucifiction)
,Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
,To find a way back to your heart
,But I break before I start
,
,Another day, I lose direction
,Memories of yesterday
,Their call, keeps me feeling small
,
,Sitting by the window
,Staring out into the night
,Waiting up for the light of day
,And the sound of silence
,The faintly flaring candle light
,Parting has got me  around to go insane
,Alone I try to while away my time
,Seconds turn to ages as I close my eyes and wait
,Sometimes I wonder
,What's the reason why
,We long for someone to embrace  and say hello to say goodbye
,Carry on - and I will forever
,Longing drives bad memories away
,And still I carry on and I will forever
,Cause when I see you smile I dare to believe again
,
,Is there anybody out there
,To keep on looking for
,If you don't know then lie to me
,Blue eyed for a letdown
,If this is what it takes
,To maybe see the light
,I'll dare to shed another tear
,Oh I Know
,The wind blows cold tonight
,But anyhow I gotta go
,Tell me girl where are you now
,
,Carry on - and I will forever
,Longing drives bad memories away
,And still I carry on and I will forever
,Cause when I see you smile  I dare to believe again
,(ah)
,I tried to build a wall
,And let nobody in
,(To be on my own)
,Without love and without pain
,(Without pain )
,I don't know why
,But every time
,I look into your face
,(Into your face)
,I am caught and I relapse again
,~music~
,Carry on, it's forever
,Longing drives and memories away
,Carry on - and I will forever
,Longing drives bad memories away
,And still I carry on and I will forever
,Cause when I see you smile  I dare to believe again
,Carry on - and I will forever
,Longing drives bad memories away
,And still I carry on and I will forever
,Cause when I see you smile  I dare to believe again
,oh~
,
,Got a picture of your house
,And you're standing by the door
,It's black and white and faded
,And it's looking pretty worn
,See the factory that I worked
,Silhouetted in the back
,The memories are grey
,but man they're really coming back
,I don't need to be the king of the world
,As long as I'm the hero of this little girl
,
,Heaven isn't too far away
,Closer to it every day
,No matter what your friends might say
,
,How I love the way you move
,And the sparkle in your eyes
,There's a color deep inside them
,Like a blue suburban sky
,
,When I come home late at night
,And you're in bed asleep
,I wrap my arms around you
,So I can feel you breathe
,
,I don't need to be a superman
,As long as you will always be my biggest fan
,
,Heaven isn't too far away
,Closer to it every day
,No matter what your friends might say
,We'll find a way (Yeah!)
,
,Now the lights are going out
,Along the boulevard
,The memories come rushing back
,And it makes it pretty hard
,
,I've got nowhere left to go
,And no one really cares
,I don't know what to do
,But I'm never giving up on you
,
,(Heaven isn't too far away)
,Closer to it every day
,No matter what your friends say
,I know we gotta find a way
,
,It's not too far away.
,It's not too far away.
,
,Yeah!
,Some want to think hope is lost
,see me stand alone
,I can't do what others may want
,then I'll have no home
,So for now wave good-bye
,and leave your hands held high
,Hear this song of courage
,long into the night
,So for now wave good-bye
,leave your hands held high
,Hear this song of courage
,long into the night
,
,And the wind will bear my cry
,to all who hope to fly
,Hear this song of courage
,ride into the night
,
,Battles are fought by those
,with the courage to believe
,They are won by those
,who find the heart
,Find a heart to share

, 作曲 : Jon Bon Jovi
,They say that no man is an island
,And good things come to those who wait
,But the things I hear are there
,Just to remind me
,Every dog will have his day
,The spirits they intoxicate me
,I watched them infiltrate my soul
,They try to say it's too late for me
,Tell my guns I'm coming home
,I swear I'm gonna live forever
,Tell my maker he can wait
,I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
,Heading back to Santa Fe��
,It's judgement day in Santa Fe
,Once I was promised absolution
,There's only one solution for my sins
,You gotta face your ghosts and know
,With no illusions
,That only one of you is going home again
,And I blame this world for making
,A good man evil
,It's this world that can drive a
,Good man mad
,And it's this world that turns a killer
,Into a hero
,Well I blame this world for making
,A good man bad
,Now I ain't getting into heaven
,If the devil has his way
,I swear I'm gonna live forever
,Heading back to Santa Fe
,Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
,It's judgement day in Santa Fe
,So I save a prayer
,For when I need it most
,To the Father, Son
,And the Holy Ghost
,And sign it from a sinner
,With no name
,When I meet my maker
,When I close the book
,On the hearts I broke
,And the lives I took
,Will he walk away
,'Cause my soul's
,Too late to save
,Now I ain't getting into heaven
,If the devil has his way
,I swear I'm gonna live forever
,Heading back to Santa Fe
,Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
,It's judgement day in Santa Fe
,I can hear the silence calling
,Curtains of darkness fallen
,Together we will stand, side by side
,
,
,I can hear how the wind blows
,And see how the sun glows
,It's safe to walk to home, once again
,
,Everything is so calm
,And you presence is so warm
,I feel safe when I'm held in your arms
,
,As the moon enters the skies
,I look into your eyes
,There's one question without and answer
,
,If I were you king would you be my queen
,Together we could stand, united, hand in hand
,Like the stars in the sky just like them you and I
,We can stay forever, together
,
,
,I believe those words you say
,I know that we could find the way
,Together we have to make it true
,
,
,Now remember these words of mine
,I'll always stand by your side

,
,Curled around you babe,
,You're lost in your head,
,I get lost in your word.
,You feel far too deep,
,It keeps you from sleep,
,And I know that it hurts.
,Tell me everything that you lost,
,Show me every home you left behind,
,Point out all the ones that you loved,
,I've got time.
,Please don't be sad,
,You don't have to smile to make it by.
,It's a new midnight, a new sunrise,
,And that can't be bad.
,Breaking through your walls gets hard when it falls,
,But I think you should know,
,When you hide away from the light, and shiver at night,
,I've been there before.
,I'll tell you everything that I lost,
,Show you every home I've left behind,
,Point out all the ones I loved,
,We got time.
,Please don't be sad,
,You don't have to smile to make it by.
,It's a new midnight, a new sunrise,
,And that can't be bad.
,And I'll stay and help you find a way,
,In the new midnight, the new sunrise,
,Everyday.
,And I'll wake up and say everything will be just fine.
,Lie to yourself, it leaves everyone high and dry
,Tell me,show me
,Please don't be sad,
,You don't have to smile to make it by.
,It's a new midnight, a new sunrise,
,And that can't be bad.
,And I'll stay and help you find a way,
,In the new midnight, the new sunrise,
,Everyday.
,I woke up before the sun
,
,Chased your ghost across the yard
,
,Through the fog and tumbling dark 'til you were gone
,
,Virginia I can hardly breathe
,I've forgotten how to sleep
,
,And your face still haunts my dreams when I'm alone
,
,So now I'm walking on a tightrope wire
,Too far off the ground
,I'm imagining the words you said when last I saw your mouth
,Yes I'm walking on a tightrope wire
,So afraid to fall
,
,And I'd tell you that I miss you
,but I'm sure it doesn't matter at all
,
,The things I gave away
,
,They're not coming back for me
,
,Should've learned from my mistakes but I never do
,
,As I lay here all alone I hang up before I call
,
,And admit to all my faults to pass the time
,
,So now I'm walking on a tightrope wire

,After all still loving you
,can't stop feeling this way

,after you anymore
,See you standing with another man
,I feel like never before
,I don't believe in fairytales
,try to stop the dark fall
,Fade away with an empty soul

,I write the lines you want me to
,with the words.
,I dare to use of all the ones
,that you have taught me
,along the years.
,You cast a perfect shadow on the paper
,Fade away with sunlight
,I fear the way you know me
,love can leave a stain
,You steal my only hope
,and make me stay awake another night.
,I wish you bear with me, stay near me.
,When the autumn leaves have fallen.
,Solitude, my pain, the last thing left me...
,If you fall I'll catch
,if you love I'll love
,and so we goes, my dear, don't be scared,
,you'll be safe, this I swear.
,If you only love me back.
,Seven lonely lies written on Deadwinter's night,
,open the only book with the only poem I can read...
,In blood I sign my name
,and seal the midnight with a tear.
,Burn the paper, every line for them I cried...
,If you fall I'll catch, if you love I'll love
,and so we goes, my dear, don't be scared,
,you'll be safe, this I swear.
,If you only love me back.
,I am the Playwrite and you are my Crown
,make me cry for your love,
,like you've done many times,so I know.
,I can't write these storylines without you
,lady pain, make me strong,
,can't we be together without them forever...
,The words I write can only hurt you
,sorry for the rain.
,Thank you, my only one
,you gave me this pain...
,I leave you gently on the floor,
,take one step towards the door.
,Where's the letter never written
,good night now...
,If you fall I'll catch
,if you love I'll love
,and so we goes, my dear
,don't be scared,
,you'll be safe, this I swear.
,If you only love me back.
,If you fall I'll catch

,If you only love me back.
,The End
,I'm learning to stand the more that I fall down,
,It's the law of inversion, and it's all turned around,
,And I'm staggered by the clash inside my soul,
,So purposed for good but inclined for evil
,
,It's justice and mercy the old dichotomies,
,All along the frontlines of my heart in both doubt and belief
,The sinner and saint, the old arch enemies,
,All at war, in me
,
,I was born depraved, but created for the divine,
,With death in my bones, in my heart eternal life,
,I'd love for Eden, but I'd kill for Rome,
,I'm native in a land that is not my home
,
,You are the beginning, and you are the end,
,Into your great reversal, I am born again,
,A beautiful redemption, you leverage even sin
,In me your final victory, I know you'll win
,
,Into light, from the shadows,
,Into life, from the grave,
,Into love, Into love

,
,新的一天已开始
,让我们快乐一点好吗
,不要总愁眉苦脸的思考你的明天
,尽管这是个悲伤而又美好的世界
,快乐的奔跑的小马
,它闪烁着出现
,　　
,来 靠近我一些
,
,说 甜蜜的语言
,
,快 再靠近我一些
,
,说 我们的明天
,
,全部的爱都已回来
,全部的恨都已离开
,我站在朦胧的站台
,等待最后一班车到来
,晚风吹拂
,生命的全部
,在穿梭的梦里面
,拼命的追逐
,故事开始没有画面
,伙伴们紧闭双眼
,醒来时却发现朋友早已不见
,留下陌生的世界待我们去冒险
,
,身后的灯火熄灭
,前方已漆黑一片
,纵然不顾一切也还需要时间
,还有更多的秘密待我们去挖掘
,
,故事最后留下悬念
,青年们睁大双眼
,耳畔响起音乐留下沸腾画卷
,这里并不只有音乐
,这里有梦也有鲜血

,春天里没有秘密
,一切都还很安静
,阳光折射入玻璃
,微风浮响风铃
,轻轻的把门打开
,你已悄然到来
,生活纵然悲哀
,我已不愿再更改

,好吧不用再说了
,这是属于我的轨迹
,只有这样我才能开心
,纵然没什么道理
,游戏已到了关底
,空虚是最后结局
,生活已然很精彩
,我已不愿再更改

,People here are real and honest

,青春是青涩的年代
,我明白 明天不会有色彩
,社会是伤害的比赛
,当我醒来时才明白
,请你不要离开
,这里胜似花开
,没有人能够掩盖
,梦境中的色彩
,请你不要离开
,这里胜似花开
,没有人会去涂改
,梦境中的色彩

,山中之城，杂乱的街
,疯狂的司机与陌生的脸
,空虚引诱脚步不停向前
,寻找江水与生命的终点
,路边小憩，抬头望天
,冥冥之中安排好的一切
,雨水嘲弄梦境被扑灭
,周围的空气都像是幻觉
,这时你就是整个世界
,当我闭上双眼时看见
,记忆中的爱与斑驳的时间
,那一天仿佛也并不遥远
,不必担心一切都会改变
,不必彷徨总有那么一天
,青年的呐喊声震彻漫山遍野
,唤醒了此刻直到永远
,停下来吧，安静一下
,让我们的心再靠近一些吧
,无尽的猜疑我已厌倦了
,请相信我从未有过任何改变

,最寂寞的一天
,我只盼望你出现
,盼望生活就此改变
,最寂寞的一天
,我蒙住双眼
,逃避现实体验幻觉
,最寂寞的一天
,独自站在街边
,在无数自我否定后点燃香烟
,最寂寞的一天
,看窗外的世界
,德外的汽笛声湮灭在六铺的街边
,最寂寞的一天
,我准备去冬眠
,那些低调背后的手段已被称作阴险
,最寂寞的一天
,我回想昨天
,在等待的时间里后知后觉
,最寂寞的一天
,你始终没有出现
,又将是魂不守舍的冰冷黑夜
,最寂寞的一天
,听快乐分裂
,也许那时间与爱已真的将我们撕裂
,音乐晃
,一切随风飘荡
,忆昔往
,当爱已成迷墙
,心雨浪
,热情漫溢盼望
,明日漾
,愿景如梦幻想
,岁月淌
,白日梦散夕阳
,风铃响
,暖风拂滤心房
,抬头望
,星夜月已树上
,明日狂
,逆子日上戎装
,
,停止吧不安的一切
,在金色世界褪色之前
,召唤我
,呼啸而过的时间
,蓝色少年也消失不见
,为什么
,未知如枯黄飘落叶
,理想躲藏在现实的后面
,颤抖着
,被噪音渲染的浮华世界
,和所有关于明日的请愿
,已过时了
,武器是时间与音乐
,敌人是自己与世界
,啊...
,身体包裹着爱与夙愿
,上升着燃于天际之间
,炫目着
,灿烂的一切源于毁灭
,已不在乎是非的界限
,结束了
,啊...
,啊...
,
,
,拨开意识的另一级
,寂寞在体内旅行
,破碎的心随血浮循
,流入记忆流出眼睛
,过去的事总要过去
,但时间亦慢如我心
,当一天我们离开这里
,那答案已写入曾经
,Aspirin.....
,深夜空荡的心灵
,垂死挣扎的爱情
,载着我们缓慢前行
,烧掉对未来的憧憬
,她倾听飘渺的声音
,心亦如远星般红移
,当未来已然灯火通明
,她卑鄙愚蠢的父亲
,Aspirin....
,满天飞舞着鳞片与彩色的斑点
,我们在巨龙的腹腺中升起炊烟
,肓龙摇摆着尾燕盘旋直入蓝天
,俯瞰广袤的原野卷曲歌声四溅
,车轮滚动着向前去另一个世界
,浴血燃烧的后面是孤独与拒绝
,后浪卷袭着青年步入红色原野
,当人们歌颂的世界已不可理解
,嘿嘿嘿...
,吹吹吹...
,Let it break...
,听吧 夜已融化
,四方神灵 缓慢兵临城下

,裙丝忆无瑕
,世情似零花
,萧风随雨刮
,她在月光下
,而年俱无怕
,吾父鬓白发
,泣斥逆子呐
,朝日见虎牙
,她在月光下

,
,渐渐茫然的人们  已经忽略了悲喜 他们在河的两岸  目睹流失
,在微凉的黄昏里  有人开始跳起舞 舞步划出的弧线  那么单纯
,他们是如此得宁静 如此得骄傲 来不及去选择 就已惊慌
,在时代华美的盛宴上 人群凌乱如草
,不懂向内生长 看起来却那么美好
,
,厌倦是欢乐背后唯一真实的伤口  最先倒下的少年还面带微笑
,没有人得到爱情没有人选择离开  被惊扰的天空啊一贫如洗
,在时代华美的盛宴上 烟花迷乱如星 短暂的灿烂让人群晕眩
,在时光无尽的辽阔里  生命轻如尘埃
,春天远去的消息 就让我们泪如雨下
,泪如雨下 泪如雨下 泪如雨 泪如雨下

  If I had time to kill the world I'd try
 Oh no, but I'm busy, killing me
 
 I don't have time to build a suicide
 Because the snowman melts in spring
 The striped girls will not be coming back
 In the summer
 They run from me
 May!
 
 I don't have time to even say good-bye
 We are dying, as winter leaves
 Spring!
 
 Snow melts in my lawn and I am free, yeah
 Corn cob pipe and a button, nose, yeah
 
 Puddled in the grass two lumps of coal
 Snow melts in my lawn and I am...
 If I had time to kill the world I'd try
 But I'm busy killing what's in me
 I don't have time to even say good-bye
 We are dying as winter leaves

Revelation #9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interview with pogo in Gaston Gazette Dec. 4, '95
D.S.: How much stuff on Revelation #9 is backwards?
Pogo: Well, there are 13 exact tracks on Revelation #9, it consists of 13 
tracks in which at least 6 are reversed.
D.S.: When we played it backwards, we heard things like \"Welcome to the other 
side\"
Pogo: Oh yeah, there is all kinds of fan stuff on there, it's playable in any 
direction. It is equally playable in any direction. It has an equal number of 
tracks in each direction.

There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're going or which way the wind is blowing
Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing?
Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing
Hey Jew, let me thank you for wasting our time! Fuck your time! Asshole!
Fuck your shit, you fucking... Shit! Fucking ho! Fucking ho! Come on, rape her! 
Get her!
Manson has probably killed the pigs without the gang!
Where the fuck's the sausage?

,Is it my imagination
,Or have I finally found
,something worth living for?
,I was looking for some action
,But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol
,You could wait for a lifetime
,To spend your days in the sunshine
,You might as well do the white line
,Cos when it comes on top . . .
,You gotta make it happen
,You gotta make it happen
,You gotta make it happen
,You gotta make it happen
,Is it worth the aggravation
,To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
,It's a crazy situation
,But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol!

,Memories
,Forever set in stone
,When all is said and done
,They’re just like the fallen leaves
,That you gather in your head
,When the sun’s about to set
,I sail out on stormy seas
,But I cannot find the shore
,Can’t hear you anymore
,And there’s nothing left for me
,I'm lying broken on the glass
,And the ship’s about to crash
,And I must say...
,I didn’t come here to make up your mind
,I do believe that you were wasting my time
,There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
,If love is the law
,Then this is a crime
,I didn’t come here to make up your mind
,I do believe that you were wasting my time
,There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
,If love is the law
,Then this is a crime
,I didn’t come here to make up your mind
,I do believe that you were wasting my time
,There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
,If love is the law
,Then this is a crime

,She was there
,Diamonds in her hair
,Singing out a dead man's song
,Here am I
,With the mighty and the high
,Feeling like I don't belong
,Yeah it's you and your book of Who's Who
,Acting like you just don't care
,We would lie low
,Got nowhere to go
,Well any road will get us there
,We never should have left town in the first place
,Now we gotta walk like they talk in the rat race
,You keep your eyes on the prize if you want it all
,You and I
,Spider and a fly
,Eating where the shadows fall
,Make room for the man who built the moon
,He arrived on a maggot horse
,Made no sound from the day you left town
,No one said a word of course
,I believe he was wearing on his sleeve
,Her heart made of blackened stone
,Said my love
,I think I've had enough
,I'm gonna find my way back home
,We never should have left town in the first place
,Now we gotta walk like they talk in the rat race

,走过全是泥的田
,想要地球绕一圈
,却困在人类动物园
,赚了没必要的脸
,花了没必要的钱

,我像一个游牧民族
,到处种下自由的树
,一路感谢兄弟们的求助
,在姑娘家的留宿
,也留不住我通向自由之路
,于是背上了背包 耳机play loud
,当所有人都睡着
,而我在路上飞高
,三千里路云和月
,音乐让有心的耳朵都听得见 uh uh
,我爱上这个世界的五颜六色
,却痛恨风景依旧却不念旧客
,它告诉我你只将自己灵魂拥有
,其他一切生在自然 死不带走

,才发现我还走在这小山间里

,当我走到沙漠中才发现周围的人大都疯
,拿着剑 互相劈砍 像积攒 了许多年的怨言
,难怪人们渐渐的 变得十分危险
,可怕的嘴脸 对彼此垂涎
,更让我看不明白的是海市蜃楼楼阁亭台
,天边那一片云彩 并不是我要的
,所以往前走
,拆穿地平线的谎言
,我不管地球是方是圆
,我都要一往直前

,他住在65栋1楼左手边的房间
,俩小无猜的故事发生在3年前的夏天
,他不爱传球  也不爱香蕉歌
,爱跟着  窗外她琴声轻轻哼着
,看着窗外  她也还没睡
,他是否觉得无聊  也需要一个人陪
,书本来去的书包不动的只有情书
,和两张过期的电影票一直没被阅读
,他拖到7点40起床  每天都迟到
,还好这时候和她刚好在走廊碰到
,从不做FUCK THAT FUCK THAT课间操
,昨晚捡到的发夹 正好放回她书包
,六月的高考伴随夏天的风
,朦朦胧胧的他她也懵懵懂懂
,收到的成绩单  已经决定了方向
,拥挤的月台手里握着往南的车票
,你知道我在等你吗  (在你家楼下)
,如果你真的在乎我  (如果你在乎的话)
,又怎会让无尽的夜陪我渡过
,(你给我一个拥抱 我丢掉我的车票)
,你知道我在等你吗  (在你家楼下)
,如果你真的在乎我  (如果你在乎的话)
,又怎会让握花的手在风中颤抖
,MY GIRL  我就莫名喜欢你
,MY GIRL  已经深深爱上你
,MY GIRL  知道你也在乎我
,MY GIRL  我会在你家的楼下等你
,有种莫名的感觉我喜欢你
,总是在夜里会突然想到你
,can you be my girl
,YES
,yes you can be my girl

,她柔弱的眼神里装的是什么 是思念的忧伤
,南方的小镇阴雨的冬天没有北方冷

,南方姑娘 你是否喜欢北方人的直爽
,日子过的就像那些不眠的晚上

,南方姑娘 是不是高楼遮住了你的希望
,
,昨日的雨曾淋漓过她瘦弱的肩膀
,夜空的北斗也没有让她找到迷途的方向
,阳光里她在院子中央晾晒着衣裳
,在四季的风中她散着头发安慰着时光

,思念让人心伤 她呼唤着你的泪光

, 移り変わっていく
, 先のことなど
, 知りたくないから
, 全て落としてた過去のことなど
, 乗り越えて取れたの
, 今更僕の初めての物語には
, 関係ない
, 何度夢が敗れたとしても
, 声が枯れたとしても
, 僕らの旅は続くから
, 君と消えなっかた願いを叶えたい
, Ahもう一回でも
, 手を取ってほしいから
, いつも一人ぼっちの時を消せた
, 思い出の場所に
, 大事な物があるから
, 僕らずっとずっと
, 言いたかった言葉は
, 本当にありがとう
, 何千回僕は
, 君のいない夜を迎えて
, 一人の朝迎えて

,君はずっと君と向き合って 行けって囁くんだ
,どんな人でも 心は一つだ こんなにも近くて 見えないね
,
,探してよ 呼び戻してよ その心で 描いてく姿を
,弱さ 強さ 全部本当なら 見たことのない花 咲かせていこう

,他们说年轻人要努力 要多去想点主意
,他们劝你怎么都好就是别去跟钱赌气
,别再呆在家里愁 被压力压扁头
,想混口饭就乖乖跟人屁股后头刮点油
,万能的开门砖 满世界都围着转
,你要把钞票堆成山 至少家里塞一半
,那怎么才叫赚到够 他说要赚够来世用的
,说除了口袋装的其他都是白日梦
,你别不服气 有钱的才有福利
,被牵着鼻子走也心甘情愿当个奴隶
,追名逐利  肝脑涂地 动着脑筋
,要把话说的好听
,还要服从钱的每个指令活着就得小心
,脸色要看得准
,什么事都办的稳
,他问你尊严能值几个钱你干嘛站着等
,还不就是点个头 不就是哈个腰
,不就是拿了钱就跑 顶多在背后插个刀

,有种人喜欢炫耀有种人不甘心
,有种人胡说八道还有种人喜欢听
,有种人为了发财什么脏活都能干
,梦想就是在家数钱最好不用出门赚
,还有种人 不在乎为钱说了多少谎话
,有种人收着黑心钱 有种人脱光躺下
,有种人脸都不要
,为钱跟家里胡闹
,有种人赚着奶粉钱 却卖着毒药
,有种人觉得家里没钱让他特别丢脸
,要面子 要里子 却没办法两者都选
,就只好违背良心
,低声下气只为换取更多黄金
,真心话说给墙听
,像老虎机在连吃必须不间断的投币
,都很傻很天真觉得会赢这场游戏
,最后却像个奴隶 在世俗监狱服役
,拿不起 放不下 有面子却没骨气

酒在我的心里发酵
你可曾感觉我的心跳
我也不知道想要什么
只渴望你的一个拥抱
那烟在我的身边环绕
你可曾感觉我的心跳
我也不知道想要什么
渐渐迷上了你的味道
我是怎么了为何乱了心跳
因为现实爱情它并不可靠
我是怎么了感觉心快死掉
你的眼神尽情燃烧
尽情燃烧
你到底爱爱爱不爱我
你却说爱爱爱是什么
可怜的人儿在惊慌失措
那都是爱爱爱的结果

,知不知这国邦, 接管阴暗陋巷,
,深宵中人们若路过这地方,
,瑟缩中不作声, 决不可以乱望,
,不想捆绑 不想曙光,
,理想夜夜游荡, （晚风伴着流浪）
,不死恶党, 不死眼光
,最厌恶去看 命运处方.（看我吧）
,凶狠对打, 被擒绝未怕（看我吧）

就算祸从口出我也要说
爱上你无法选择再沉默
谁愿意做第三者付出太多
只因身不由己 深深地陷落

就算没有结果也不忍错过
来生只不过凄美的传说
茫茫人海两个人相遇多难得
明知你也爱我 我怎能懦弱。

我爱你爱得迷失了自我
疼你太完美 承受这许多
若你多一些自私 再少几分温柔
或许我不会这样受折磨
我爱你爱得掏空了心窝
怨你太狠心 放任我寂寞
若我多一些清醒 再少几分执着
你会不会反而更好过

高高的雪山上白雪茫茫
 山下开放着暖暖的毡房
 毡房里有位叫雪莲的姑娘
 一边在梳妆一边轻声的歌唱
 蓝蓝的天空下青草荡漾
 红红的太阳映红了脸庞
 转经筒重复着日夜的思念
 一边去牧羊一边向远方眺望
 雪莲姑娘雪莲花儿一样
 她的眼睛有似水的忧伤
 雪莲姑娘雪莲花儿一样
 她身上穿着最美最美的衣裳
 雪莲姑娘雪莲花儿一样
 定情的哥哥去了远方
 雪莲姑娘雪莲花儿一样
 她用祥云编织心中的哈达

从不知担心 彷似天真
分担彼此黑暗 总会靠近
相衬亦亲 痛爱一生
几多风雨都不会分
然而此刻风声 暗示报警
他的鲜花吸引 引你心倾
不懂弥补 破碎泡影
情如心死不想醉醒
这么多的身影簇拥着你
你掌握于手中竟当成储备
当你将爱分割赠多少个知己
而没有交出真心可否算完美
这么多的身影簇拥着你
你掌握于手中竟当成储备
当你跟我相对无言相对演戏
宁愿对你说句不想跟你痛悲

还要多少时间 才能停止想念
在这样的夜晚
你是否和我一样不知道该找谁聊天
女人哭花了双眼 男人湿透了衣衫
两个人相拥却孤单
留下了什么遗憾在身边在昨天
从一开始相互牵绊到争吵
用了多少天
从承诺出发一路提心吊胆
只因为不想走散
如果不爱了就别勉为其难
虽然我也不想说声再见
用手画出的圆缺总不圆满
孤独患者一个人的狂欢
如果留不住就别勉为其难
就算痛也不让自己难堪
总想有人去管别袖手旁观
总会等到对的人说晚安

,醒来不见爹娘面,
,只见窗前明月光.
,冬季到来雪茫茫,
,寒衣做好送情郎.
,血肉筑出长城长,

,Goodbye my love
,I'm goanna miss you
,When I go I promise to forget
,I'd never twist a story sideways
,I was traveled different highways
,And it always leads me back to you again
,We connected through the distance
,With electric hearts somehow
,Still dreaming bout tomorrow-oh oh
,But all we have is now
,Now now
,All we have is now
,The future's on illusion
,Don't fall for empty vows
,All we have is now
,Staons on the paper
,Are tears from yesterday
,When the colors start to fade it's like it rained
,My thoughts could fill an ocean
,I'm drowing in emotion
,And we'll never have this moment back again
,Chain a light through all the bridges
,That somehow kisses the sky
,And the angels tart to cry
,Cause all we have is now
,All we have is now
,The future's on illusion
,Don't fall for empty vows
,All we have is now
,Sounds of silence cross our minds
,It's not the record playing
,We're closer
,All we have is now
,And in this one reality
,Single words come suddenly
,An accident of melody and harmany
,All we have is now
,
,Cause all we have is now
,All we have is now
,The future's on illusion
,Don't fall for empty vows
,All we have is now

,Don't fall for empty vows

,温暖不了某个夜晚
,唯有情歌貌似单纯
,会唱的人却已经沉默
,曾经我们不分白天黑夜
,唱着情歌一路来看你
,你如此回答
,情歌而已
,如果我们不分白天黑夜
,唱着情歌一路来看你
,你一定回答
,情歌而已
,没有方向就去寻找
,别的一切都已不重要
,最好给你一片空旷
,让你失去喧闹的勇气

,你现在在外面了
,
,在士丹利街
,北巷陆羽茶室
,前面是正邦大厦
,
,
,我们往左拐
,上山去
,
,那男孩在我右边
,和我并肩而行
,一股奇特的麝香和芒果香味扑鼻而来
,那是他的香气
,我永远不会忘记
,眼前所见的街道最老的不超过一百六十年
,他跟我说 他的爷爷曾经做过鸦片买卖
,士丹利街大多是鸦片批发商
,他们家的商店
,一楼是办公室 商人住在二楼
,
,香港的经济时跨是在鸦片的浓烟中开始的
,香港 本来就是指焚香的港口
,
,现在停下来
,我们来到砵典乍街
,这是香港最古老的街道
,看到那个在缝衣服的男人吗
,他是我的朋友周先生
,周先生是一九四七年来到香港的难民
,他在砵典乍街当裁缝已经五十年了
,那台裁缝机也陪伴了他三十五年
,现在左转 沿着砵典乍街往上走吧
,小心绊倒
,
,那些圆石头很滑
,慢慢走
,
,在裁缝和卖假发的小贩来到这里以前
,这里经常会听到脚镣的锒铛声
,当时兴建砵典乍街是为了连接警察局和前面的监狱
,看 就在那边 这些建筑现在都荒废了
,政府想拆掉它们 却迎来极大反对的声音
,
,再往上走
,我们来到路口
,眼前的是威灵顿街
,等一下
,看看右边 这里曾经是红灯区
,夜之女都聚集在这
,当时的香港四处都是水手 商人和探险家
,
,
,现在右转
,沿着威灵顿街往下走
,那男孩告诉我 他爷爷的伙伴是个美国商人
,爱上了一个跟他身份不符的二十一岁妓女
,他交了很多罚款
,妓院把他剩下的钱全都拿走了
,他的爱 让他踏上了破产之路
,最后 他在那妓女的床上
,自杀了
,
,我没有作声
,我不喜欢悲惨的故事
,那女孩后来怎么样了
,根本 就没有人关心她的命运
,
,
,现在我们继续沿着威灵顿街往下走
,请注意 左转门牌七十一到七十三号我们要去那里
,往上看 有一个雕花的红木牌
,找到了没
,
,里头是一列铁邮箱
,找到七十一到期十三号了吗
,
,进去了吗
,上楼去
,
,那男孩先走 我跟着他
,他静悄悄的走着 只听见我的脚步声
,突然 我看到他的体温有点心猿意马
,继续上楼去
,现在你面前有两扇桔子色和黑色的门
,进去  欢迎
,现在我们进去了 左转 穿过木拱门
,你走进一个铺满白色瓷砖的大房间
,停下来
,头上的旧式电风扇在慢慢转动
,
,看看前面
,墙壁分为三个部分
,左  中  右
,看看右边的部分
,见到数字吗
,找第八行
,再从下而上的数到第八层
,一 二 三 四 五 六 七 八
,看到他吗
,许多年前 那男孩给我看过这张照片 八层八号的照片
,
,男孩说 我们长的很像对不对
,我答 是啊 你们长的还真像
,男孩说 我看照片的时候 我觉得跟他很亲近 我想他渴望被爱
,我问他为什么
,他说 你仔细看他的眼睛
,我内心泛起一股莫名的哀伤
,我对男孩说 既然 爱会无声无息的逝去 为什么还要被爱
,墙上的每一张照片 都藏着一个失去的爱情故事
,他对我说 难道你不需要被爱吗 我们都会消失的 但对爱的渴望却长存不灭
,身边 都是来参拜和参与宗教仪式的人
,他们为已故的亲人奉上水果还有饭菜
,希望亡魂能够安息
,我们中国人是很重视祖先的
,
,
,现在转身
,走过大厅
,往前走
,走下那金龙下的四级阶梯
,
,右边的是道仙八大家之一的吕洞宾的祭坛
,停在这
,心中焚香祈求吕洞宾庇佑
,抬头看看天花板
,
,好
,走吧
,继续穿过道观
,右边有另外一扇印有yineng图案的玻璃门
,拉开门
,下楼去
,
,
,继续往下走
,
,小心碰头
,
,现在我们又回到威灵顿街
,往右拐
,沿着威灵顿街而下
,右边是七十七号的门牌 是香港最著名的食店之一
,麦奀云吞面世家
,从窗户往右边看 前面的锅里尽是煮开了的面条
,想要面条软硬适中需要有相当的技巧哦
,继续下山
,
,
,现在你在阁麟街和威灵顿街的街角
,往右拐 我们沿着阁麟街而下
,抬头看左边 你会看到一道手扶电梯
,它可是全世界最长的扶手电梯
,从码头带你到半山也能带你到苏豪区
,就在街角前
,你会看到一家古老的中药店在右边
,叫 回春堂药行
,在阁麟街八号
,走进中药店

,或者就这样吧
,不要再去找她
,你经已失去她
,便由她去吧
,就这样算了吧
,或者你不够喜欢她
,如果你够喜欢她
,不会暗地喜欢这牵挂
,.
,是很久没这感觉吧
,似回到中学的暑假
,那年第一次失去她
,还未学会潇洒
,.
,是结束得不够浪漫吧
,你才这么不舍得她
,如果永远也离不开她
,你便会更害怕
,.
,现在不是更好吗
,她永远变了一幅画
,你只需要间中挂起她
,.

,（客）我就这样痛哭一场

,Ainsi qu'une douzaine d'huîtres
,Une bouteille de Pomerol
,Et des profiteroles
,Je jouis, je jouis,
,J'en suis tout ébloui
,Je jouis, je jouis, je jouis
,Je suis centenaire
,Mais je suis encore vert
,J'ai l'âge d'être arrière
,Arrière, arrière, arrière
,Mon fils est un vieux chnoque
,Ma fille est une vieille bique
,Quand je l'embrasse, elle pique
,Y en a marre des vioques
,Je jouis, je jouis
,Quand j'entendrais le glas oui
,Je jouirais encore
,Je veux mourir comme Félix Faure
,Na,na,na,na,na,na...

,Mustang cabriolet
,Les chevaux du moteur
,Au plein coeur d'une averse
,Les excès de l'ivresse
,S'affichaient au compteur
,.
,Un soir que l'on filait
,Mustang cabriolet
,Un amour ordinaire
,Nos meilleurs souvenirs
,S'endormaient sur le cuir
,De la banquette arrière
,.
,Et devant nous l'espace
,Nos reflets dans la crasse
,Dans la course un peu lasse
,Des balais d'essuie-glaces
,Et devant nous l'espace
,Les regrets qui s'effacent
,Au rythme de la valse
,Des balais d'essuie-glaces

,Un soir que l'on faisait
,Mustang cabriolet
,La course des nuages
,En plein coeur de la pluie
,Des torrents de folie torrents de
,Innondaient nos visages

,Un soir qu'on s'évadait
,Mustang cabriolet
,Dans un état d'urgence
,Disparissait la peur
,Dans les parfums d'ailleurs
,Et les vapeurs d'essence

,Les chevaux du V8
,Dans un dernier virage
,On payait au passage
,Nos égards de conduite

,Mustang cabriolet
,Comme à la fin d'un film
,Et notre amour exampte
,Cabriolet Mustang
,S'emmurait dans l'ab?me

,为何还没有吵架便怕要与你开战
,每日面临你考验
,头一次顾虑我没动人条件

,
,我们现在走上德辅道 停在这儿
,左边的红砖建筑物是西港城
,面前就是香港电车站
,我们会坐电车 车费只要几块钱
,要小心右边的车子
,过了两个安全岛
,走上等着的电车
,我们现在走过安全岛了
,一个 两个 上车 但不用付钱
,下车时再付钱
,在电车的门前上车 然后走上右边的楼梯
,找个前排的位子 对 就那个呀 坐下来
,他说 留下来 不要坐这班车
,他的声音带着绝望 我心碎了
,从手袋拿出纸笔 交给他
,他掷了一支 一脸黯然
,然后 叹息一声
,很快的写了个号码
,为什么我会如此依恋一个只认识一个小时的男人
,我对他一无所知 怎么会发生这些事
,我很开心很肯定地说 今天晚上八点半
,我会在陆羽茶室的同一个位子等你
,现在 我得走了 再见
,电车开了 他的声音在我的脑海中萦绕不散
,留下来 跟我来
,我回头去看车站 他不见了
,我在德辅道寻找他的身影
,街上的路人不多 但他却消失了
,我把窗拉下来 微风轻拂我的脸
,他到哪儿去了
,路人 街道 高楼大厦
,在我身边轻轻地流走
,那天晚上我去到茶室
,决定告诉他我的身份 还要问他的名字
,可是他不在
,我从手袋里拿出写着他电话号码的纸条
,很奇怪 颜色已经褪了 看不清楚
,我一直等到茶室关门 他却都不出现
,从此每次我回到香港 如果有时间
,又感到寂寞 我便会沿着他带我走过的路
,再走一遍
,在一间道教堂内
,照片上的男孩对前来拜祭的人凄凉地微笑着
,他和那个男孩长得真像
,他的名字是88
,现在 到你去探索了
,去找你的爱 想乘多久就乘多久
,觉得合适 就下车
,可能我们会再见
,
,假使参拜远方的祭坛
,信我会在圣像的脚下
,假使观看远山的晚霞
,云是我
,数数几个建筑的街吧
,信我会在永恒的街下
,数数几对褪色的波鞋
,泥是我
,我信你爱着我
,天边海角也肯找我吧 找我吧
,我信你碰着我
,就在日和夜之间
,怀疑途上那人是我
,可惜匆匆经已走过
,怀疑途上那儿是我
,可惜通通错过
,或者 我
,在这边
,在那边
,请找 我
,走不完的路 随时身处于现实的残酷
,我们都故作勇敢 谁会真的领悟
,这日出日暮不会根据你的意识颠覆
,随便你 造作不安 然后让你被动退出
,你的倔强都变得麻木
,还有什么可以任你肆意摆布
,结局悲惨 完败落幕
,哪怕你说着要分出胜负
,所有一切都已结束
,除了挣扎不会再有任何变数
,所有纯真 被现实杀戮
,留下那颗倦怠的心 茫然四顾

,To get her to return the feelings that he had
,To show her how he thought they were entwined

,All we want is to forget
,We got lifted on a Monday
,Then we floated away and it was Sunday
,All we want is to forget
,All we want is to forget
,We get high up on the low down
,Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
,All we want is to forget
,All we want is to forget

,Counting down to Christmas
,I can't believe how much I miss this
,Counting down to Christmas
,I'll be coming home to you
,Just one more night
,Of me, myself and the spotlight
,I'm out here on the road
,Driving through the snow
,Driving through the snow
,Counting down to Christmas
,Only one can own my x
,Counting down to Christmas
,Yes, I'm coming home to you
,The sun will rise
,And I'll be looking in your eyes
,Just one more night to go
,Driving through the snow

,Those cocaine kisses make my lips numb
,Murmur the words so we can begin
,Tell me that you want only my love
,We're drowning in your vodka sin
,There's light in your eyes
,But a darkness in your heart
,An angel's gonna die tonight
,And heaven will forget to cry
,In flames our names were sworn
,From flames we both were born
,Collecting my tears in your teacups
,Blink eyelashes made of tin
,Don't wipe her lipstick off your mouth
,Cos I know where you have been
,There's light in your eyes
,But a darkness in your heart
,An angel's gonna die tonight
,And heaven will forget to cry

,Right from start he lured me in

,I think I’m in love
,I think I’m in love
,He might have bent me but I didn’t break
,He rearranged the map I made
,But I think I’m in love

,They say this is America
,Free speech, free will
,But I don’t even care it all
,I can’t seem to fight this
,Needing him every day and night
,Why can I just try to speak my mind to him
,Tell him all the things that he probably thought was coming
,But didn’t want him thinking that I’m trying to rush it
,Please dear God, give me the words
,‘Cause you know my tongue ties as soon as I see him blushing
,I get my thoughts, put it all on a page
,I might get to find a way out of the maze
,That I built for myself for some kind of haze
,Until the right words come to me one by one
,I hope he tells me that he loves me the same
,I hope he don’t laugh or worse walk away

,I just can’t live my life without him

,I’m not one to really talk at all
,Speak up only when the time is right or when it calls
,For the big guns problem is where to speak from
,I hear it is your heart that does all the talking
,Hurry up you got no time to waste
,‘Cause this is the man I’m loving for always
,And the honest to God, truth of the matter
,I just can’t see my life going on without you

,Do you remember the taste of my lips that night
,I stole a bit of my mother's perfume?
,Cause I remember when my father put his fist through the wall that separated the dining room
,And I remember the fear in your eyes
,The very first time we snuck into the city pool
,Late December with my heart in my chest and the clouds of my breath
,Didn't know where we were running to
,Don't look back
,Cause we'll be looking for sunlight
,Or the headlights
,Till our wide eyes burn blind
,We'll be lacing the same shoes
,That we've worn through
,To the bottom of the line
,And we know that we're headstrong
,And our heart's gone
,And the timing's never right
,But for now let's get away
,On a Roman holiday
,Could you imagine the taste of your lips if we never tried to kiss on the drive to Queens?
,Cause I imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat
,I imagine the tears in your eyes
,The very first night I'll sleep without you
,And when it happens I'll be miles away
,And a few months late
,Didn't know where I was running to
,But I won't look back
,Cause we'll be looking for sunlight
,Or the headlights
,Till our wide eyes burn blind
,We'll be lacing the same shoes
,That we've worn through
,To the bottom of the line
,And we know that we're headstrong
,And our heart's gone
,And the timing's never right
,So for now let's get away
,On a Roman holiday
,Feet first, don't fall
,Or we'll be running again
,Keep close, stand tall
,We'll be looking for sunlight
,Or the headlights
,Till our wide eyes burn blind
,We'll be lacing the same shoes
,That we've worn through
,To the bottom of the line
,And we know that we're headstrong
,And our heart's gone
,And the timing's never right

hook:
我们强势侵略过街道
引擎声让所有人都听到
当我变身把舞台准备好
摇滚灵魂变狂躁
记住FMC

verse1:
站在2118得山巅
仰视两座雕像在眼前
时间回转一百年
回到2018得那一天
雷鼠之战的瞬间
引擎声回荡在天边
耀眼闪电 摇晃的地面
风吹过身边 冲出起点
工匠派登场闪耀着光芒
改装车世界里面无人可阻挡
音乐在奏响轰鸣声发狂
平庸无奇的全部都退场
油门踩到底 推背的冲力
斯柯达 柯珞克 批新的战衣
热浪 空气 无人能匹敌
赛雷 李老鼠 F M C

verse2:
OK 
让你感受巨浪般的狂涌
侧裙侵略着你的瞳孔
my Homie 站在车旁
神情迷离身陷入其中
360℃完美的震撼感觉不止是肉眼能看得到
就算是赛雷下毒药
也抵挡不住
英雄工匠派的咆哮
低调的奢华斯柯达 柯珞克你会懂
不需要太多的浮夸因为我有上帝的恩宠
no PS&no love 就算通天大道也会有闪失
one dream放下固执让
这艺术为
这个故事大鹏展翅

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story
About the joker and the thief of the night
He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So, we are not goin' home
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in a field of clover
Watching out everyday
I wonder what would happen if he took her away
What you see will you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is movin' slow
So I'll tell you all the story
'bout the joker and the thief of the night
All the people that you see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilderbeast is searching for sight
We are not goin' home
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in a field of clover
Watching out everyday
I wonder what would happen if he took her away
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
Tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you all the story
'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you all about the joker and the thief
Of the night

,Many times I’ve walked the line
,I’ve rolled the dice and questioned my life
,Many times I sacrificed and dealt with the pain
,I’ve been down this road before
,Where the dead ends are
,It rains and it pours
,I’ve been down below and
,It’s the price that I paid
,I know how it feels when you have to start again
,Now there’s no one to save me
,I know how it feels when the world is gonna end
,But they’ll see
,I’m gonna make a comeback
,I’m gonna dig six feet up tonight
,I’m gonna get it all back
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,Look into my eyes you’ll see
,A graveyard filled with dirt and defeat
,Look into my eyes you’ll see
,The weight on my soul
,Where the fallen angels sleep
,The crooked hearts and the crossroads meet
,Where the haters say my name
,And carve it in stone
,I know how it feels when I haven’t got a friend
,Even when they’re standin’ beside me
,I know how it feels when the world is gonna end
,But they’ll see
,I’m gonna make a comeback
,I’m gonna dig six feet up tonight
,I’m gonna get it all back
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,Risk it all, I’m gonna risk it all
,I’m gonna break my back and risk it all
,I’m gonna pick my spot, take my shot,
,Swallow my pride and risk it all
,I’m gonna risk it all
,And I won’t look back
,I’m gonna pick my spot,
,Take my shot, swallow my pride
,And risk it all
,The light’s on, the last round
,The dark horse keeps on fightin’
,I’m gonna make a comeback
,I’m gonna dig six feet up tonight
,I’m gonna get it all back
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,I’m gonna make a comeback
,I’m gonna dig six feet up tonight
,I’m gonna get it all back
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,Yeah, a comeback, a comeback
,I’m gonna make a comeback this time
,I’m gonna comeback, I’m gonna comeback
,I’m gonna comeback
,I’m diggin’ up six feet tonight

,Courage is the thing you need to find
,When you're about to cross the line
,Where there is more than just time to kill
,War will flow and then blood will spill
,Tensions are about to overflow
,Cut with a knife and watch it go
,Missiles soon will rule the open skies
,Carnage will rain down from on high
,大地を駆け抜けて
,進め地の果てへ
,静寂を切り裂き
,光　胸に秘め
,再び繰り返す
,縁を断ち切り
,悼みを抱きしめ
,目覚め　狂喜になれ！
,HEY!
,Welcome to the stage!
,Ms. YOKO TAKAHASHI!
,War is hell but it must be
,Dwell not negative signs
,Focus your mind to be your guide eternally
,After all is said and done
,What will be
,Will be
,There can be no turning back of time
,The deed is done
,All the wrongs are not made right
,By wishful thinking
,He who pays the piper calls the tunes' bitter sweet melody.
,広い世界の片隅
,翼広げ飛び立つ今
,喜びも悲しみも
,君の明日を輝かせて行く…
,
,Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
,Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
,We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
,There are things that we can have, but can't keep
,
,If they say
,Who cares if one more light goes out?
,In a sky of a million stars
,It flickers, flickers
,Who cares when someone's time runs out?
,If a moment is all we are
,Or quicker, quicker
,Who cares if one more light goes out?
,Well I do
,
,The reminder, pull the floor from your feet
,In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
,And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
,Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
,
,If they say
,Who cares if one more light goes out?
,In a sky of a million stars

,I met you in the dark
,You lit me up
,You made me feel as though
,I was enough
,We danced the night away
,We drank too much
,I held your hair back when
,You were throwing up
,
,Then you smiled over your shoulder
,For a minute, I was stone cold sober
,I pulled you closer to my chest
,And you asked me to stay over
,I said, I already told ya
,I think that you should get some rest
,
,I knew I loved you then
,But you'd never know
,Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
,I know I needed you
,But I never showed
,But I wanna stay with you
,Until we're grey and old
,Just say you won't let go
,Just say you won't let go
,
,I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
,I'll bring you coffee
,With a kiss on your head
,And I'll take the kids to school
,Wave them goodbye
,And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
,
,When you looked over your shoulder
,For a minute, I forget that I'm older
,I wanna dance with you right now, oh
,And you look as beautiful as ever
,And I swear that everyday you'll get better
,You make me feel this way somehow
,
,I'm so in love with you
,And I hope you know
,Darling your love is more than its worth in gold
,We've come so far my dear
,Look how we've grown
,And I wanna stay with you
,Until we're grey and old
,Just say you won't let go
,Just say you won't let go
,
,I wanna live with you
,Even when we're ghosts
,Cause you were always there for me
,When I needed you most
,I'm gonna love you till
,My lungs give out
,I promise till death we part
,Like in our vows
,So I wrote this song for you
,Now everybody knows
,Cause it's just you and me
,Until we're grey and old
,Just say you won't let go
,Just say you won't let go
,Just say you won't let go
,Oh, just say you won't let go

,They’ll live on forever
,And so I decided long ago 
,As life starts closin’ in
,I’d raise a glass and toast to all That it’s a simple life you live
,I decided long ago That I’d be more like him
,For the rain the sun the sleet or snow
,It’s a simple life I live
,If I was poor or rich or young or old
,It all hangs on a string
,But when my day has come I hope they say
,It’s the simple life I live  It’s the simple life I lived

,Well we grew up together, as friends,
,we weathered the storms,
,that blew cross the planes
,From Ohio to Texas,
,veryone who met us helped,
,keep us dry from the rain,
,But where's my old friend now?
,Oh, where's my old friend now?
,In the blink of an eye,
,you've gone from my side,
,without saying good bye,
,Oh where's, my old friend now?
,Over my shoulders
,as the winter blew colder,
,I saw you there,
,You were standing behind me,
,better remind me,
,that someone still cares,
,But where's my old friend now?
,Oh, where's my old friend now?
,In the blink of an eye,
,you have gone from my side,
,without saying good bye,
,Oh where's, my old friend now?
,And I know you can hear me,
,though you're so far away,
,And I wish you could steer me back,
,I'm off my tracks,
,And know that I need ya,
,I'm open to see ya,
,come ridin' back into town
,I can't do this myself,
,and I'm needing your help,
,I'm swimming, but soon I will drown,
,So where's my old friend now?

,The dawn is breaking
,A light shining through
,You're barely waking
,And I'm tangled up in you
,Yeah
,I'm open, you're closed
,Where I follow, you'll go
,I worry I won't see your face
,Light up again
,Even the best fall down sometimes
,Even the wrong words seem to rhyme
,Out of the doubt that fills my mind
,I somehow find
,You and I collide
,I'm quiet you know
,You make a frist impression
,I've found I'm scared to know I'm always on your mind
,Even the best fall down sometimes
,Even the stars refuse to shine
,Out of the back you fall in time
,I somehow find
,You and I collide
,Even the best fall down sometimes
,Even the wrong words seem to ryhme
,Out of the doubt that fills your mind
,You finally find
,You and I collide
,You finally find
,You and I collide
,You finally find
,You and I collide
,Well, the streets are empty
,where we used to run,
,and the cars are all on fire
,Yeah, we fall like leaves
,in the garden of Eden, Eden
,Now remember
,how it felt being in the sun,
,when I heard the ancient choir
,And the dead of night
,like an angel singing, singing
,Time doesn't love you anymore
,But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
,Honey we can run forever,
,if forever it's what's install
,Oh, time to take me home
,On a tree in the garden
,I carved your name,
,an word is spelled desire!
,Like an ocean deep
,with the waters even, even
,And your love pours down
,like a waterfall,
,and I can't escape the tide
,Here's my hand,
,baby take it or leave it, leave it
,cause time doesn't love you anymore,
,But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
,Honey we can run forever,
,if forever it's what's install
,Oh, time to take me home
,ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
,Now we're too young to recognize
,Nothing stays the same
,Promise I won't be the one to blame!
,'Cause time doesn't love you anymore,
,But I-I-I I'm still knocking at your door
,Honey we can run forever,
,if forever it's what's install
,Oh, time doesn't love you
,like I love you!
,So take me home
,ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
,Let me hear you say,
,let me hear you say
,My hands they still believe in you
,My heart learns staring through
,My back against the wall
,Singing yesterday's lies
,I wish that you could see me through
,Tomorrow's hard
,You're sop in love
,No one it seems
,So clear your tears
,They drown your dreams
,Just think of what I'm saying
,Before you decide
,Cause I wish that you could see me through
,Tomorrow's hard
,So many times I crossed the line
,To get to you
,No one likes you quite the way I do
,Try to understand the songs that I sing to you
,No one likes you quite the way I do
,My hands are here to feel your pain
,Like the clouds appear before the rain
,Just think of what I'm saying
,Before you decide
,Cause I wish that you could see me through
,Tomorrow's hard
,So...
,So many times I crossed the line
,To get to you
,No one likes you quite the way I do
,Try to understand the songs that I sing to you
,No one likes you quite the way I do

,Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
,I've come to know that memories
,Were the best things you ever had
,The summer shone beat down on bony backs
,So far from home where the ocean stood
,Down dust and pine cone tracks
,We slept like dogs down by the fire side
,Awoke to the fog where all around us
,The bloom of summertime
,We stood
,Steady as the stars in the woods
,So happy-hearted
,And the warmth rang true inside these bones
,As the old pine fell we sang
,Just to bless the morning.
,Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,
,I've come to know the friends around you
,Are all you'll always have
,Smoke in my lungs, or the echoed stone
,Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
,With weightless souls now.
,We stood
,Steady as the stars in the woods
,So happy-hearted
,And the warmth rang true inside these bones
,We stood
,Steady as the stars in the woods
,So happy-hearted
,And the warmth rang true inside these bones
,As the old pine fell we sang
,Just to bless the morning.
,We grow, grow, steady as the morning
,We grow, grow, older still
,We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
,We grow, grow, older still
,We grow, grow, steady as the flowers
,We grow, grow, older still
,We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn
,We grow, grow, older still
,In the spring we made a boat
,out of feathers, out of bones.
,We set fire to our homes,
,walking barefoot in the snow.
,Distant rhythm of the drum
,as we drifted towards the storm.
,Baby lion lost his teeth,
,now they're swimming in the sea.
,
,Troubled spirits on my chest
,where they laid to rest.
,The birds all left my tall friend
,as your body hit the sand.
,Million stars up in the sky
,formed a tigers eye
,
,that looked down on my face,
,out of time and out of place.
,So hold on,
,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,
,Awaken by the sound
,of a screaming owl.
,Chasing leafs in the wind,
,going where we've never been.
,Said goodbye to you my friend,
,as the fire spread.
,All that's left are your bones
,that will soon sink like stones
,So hold on,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,You may call it in this evening
,But you've only lost the night
,Preset all your pretty feelings
,May they comfort you tonight

,I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
,When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
,But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
,With my father in a casket, I had no plans
,And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
,And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
,But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
,Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around
,But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
,And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
,
,While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
,Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
,So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
,From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
,But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
,And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
,And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
,But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part
,
,I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
,But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
,Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
,It's a bed and a bathroom
,And a place for the end
,I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
,And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

,Raise your sword and shield.

,Was there more than just the prose of night?

,Beaten down awhile I lift up my prayer.
,Broken promises have set the snare;both sincere and not.

,My back is turned on you
,Should've known you'd bring me heartache
,Almost lovers always do
,We walked along a crowded street
,You took my hand and danced with me
,In the shade
,And when you left, you kissed my lips
,You told me you would never, never forget
,These images
,No

I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
This will not be the place for my tomb
Can you save my life?
There's no way
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
What can we do when we are lost
When we are lost
I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
Here the sun rise, the moon doesn't shine
I want to find the way
I can't die in this place
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
I'm lost
Take me back home
I will never come back to this place

,I'll fight till I fall to ashes
,Got nowhere else to go
,Lay me down, cut my throat, yes you could trap me
,But never kill my will to go (Got nowhere else to go)
,Look into my eyes when your dreams all fall
,Where my beast hiding inside

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?

,再画上一张床
,画一个姑娘陪着我
,再画个花边的被窝
,画上灶炉与柴火
,我们一起生来一起活
,
,画一群鸟儿围着我
,再画上绿岭和青坡
,画上宁静与祥和
,雨点儿在稻田上飘落
,画上有你能用手触到的彩虹
,画中有我决定不灭的星空
,画上弯曲无尽平坦的小路
,尽头的人家梦已入
,画上母亲安详的姿势
,还有橡皮能擦去的争执
,画上四季都不愁的粮食
,悠闲的人从没心事
,
,我没有擦去争吵的橡皮
,只有一支画着孤独的笔
,那夜空的月也不再亮

,看到路边孤单徘徊的山羊
,沉默的山羊变得慌慌张张
,像迷途的小孩丢掉了翅膀
,我说山羊，跟我回家吧
,它咩着小曲把羊角擦亮
,寻寻觅觅，美丽山羊
,边走边唱你要去何方
,奔波着，向往着
,转瞬即逝留下这片枯黄
,不知轻狂，倔强山羊
,迷住双眼的是不是理想
,遥望着，辗转着
,任命运支配这一刻时光
,七月的阳光曾经为我守望
,守望着每一段旅途的过往
,我说山羊，带我回家吧

,山羊山羊，一直在路上
,面对这纷纷扰扰无处躲藏
,期待着，遗憾着
,走在每个远方思念故乡
,仲夏的酒，到夜的尽头
,光阴的故事在随风飘荡
,轮回着，无悔着
,呼唤着青春这一刻时光
,三月的烟雨 飘摇的南方
,你坐在你空空的米店
,你一手拿着苹果 一手拿着命运
,在寻找你自己的香
,
,窗外的人们 匆匆忙忙
,把眼光丢在潮湿的路上
,你的舞步 划过空空的房间
,时光就变成了烟
,爱人 你可感到明天已经来临
,码头上停着我们的船
,我会洗干净头发 爬上桅杆
,撑起我们葡萄枝嫩叶般的家

,风光背后的沧桑肮脏
,如果能够让我回到
,记忆的时光
,我不会向现实投降
,我们都明白回忆的模样
,回忆是痛回忆是伤
,回忆把旧故事里的人
,精神捆绑
,回忆总是很长很长
,我一个人度过漫长的时光
,你早已不在我身旁
,曾经我以为未来很长很长
,才发现回忆最难忘

,你还记得吗 那时的夜晚
,是如何降临的
,什么都不说 像来自天空
,轻如指尖的触痛
,你是否得到了 期待的人生
,梦里的海潮声
,他们又如何从 指缝中滑过
,像吹在旷野里的风
,世界在雾中 那些人说着
,来吧 就不见了
,从未看清过 这一座迷宫
,所有走错的路口
,那些死去的人 停留在夜空
,为你点起了灯
,有时你乘起风 有时你沉没
,有时午夜有彩虹
,有时你唱起歌 有时你沉默
,有时你望着天空
,情长 飘黄 静悄悄的时光
,清晨 日暮 何处是我的归宿

,当你变的模糊不已
,清晨是否已来临
,薄雾渐渐散落一地
,你也随之而去
,这一别再也没有归期
,前半生已经过去
,细数口袋里的青春
,寥寥无几
,没人知道我的名字
,也不会有人提起
,而我最后变成了那
,孤独的蚂蚁
,厌倦了北平的生活
,却又不知去哪里
,突然看到鸿雁
,飞向南方
,一朵野花 随风摆荡
,我撑着船儿逃离了故乡
,随手撕碎了往事
,还有你送的谎
,一直到我来到远方
,孤独的海洋
,打碎了所有的船
,不曾想过回到伤心的北方
,也许已经过去
,也许还没有来临
,挥之不去的是已经
,丢失的美丽

,缓缓的飞向天堂
,穿过你的城市
,去向南方

,漆黑天際 細賞銀河如畫
,街燈之下 卻捉不緊雪花
,活在現實
,難釐定黑白似木偶
,搖擺中錯失出口
,煙花璀燦 美景卻難常久
,一閃即逝 記憶都給帶走
,熱汗熱涙
,隨停頓心跳便沒有
,而捨不捨得都走
,時光不會逗留
,名字逐個帶走
,什麼生死不過是藉口
,曾說過下次再會
,談天共 攀頂峯欣賞
,萬里無邊星際
,回望昨天總算沒枉費
,煙花璀燦 美景卻難常久
,一閃即逝 記憶都給帶走

,而捨不捨得都走

,名字逐個帶走
,什麼生死不過是藉口
,曾說過下次再會
,談天共 攀頂峯欣賞
,萬里無邊星際
,流逝昨天的美麗
,紛爭終於過去
,不須解釋黑白原罪
,攻守跟反擊
,只不過生存上那顧慮
,怎麼簡單道理沒法懂
,為著毎日過活在拼命
,時光不會逗留
,名字逐個帶走
,什麼生死不過是藉口
,曾說過下次再會
,談天共 放下這一場
,沒有贏家的仗
,人到最終方發現真相
,沒有誰可改變
,人到最終七尺下相見

,油尖旺金毛玲 最怕有閃電
,想起舊愛 Ming 仔還過電
,但不夠詞彙在記憶裏面
,只知道大概不想講再見
,油尖旺金毛玲 看盡世間事
,靠 Facebook 抒發感情才是意義
,句式過分文藝最委曲的暗示
,那些文青本身也很中意
,熟睡到晚上
,獨對四面牆
,劏房裏濃妝粉飾戰衣穿上
,出去等邊個欣賞
,
,油尖旺金毛玲 晚上就出現
,漆黑的 K 房裏唱心事
,旁邊西裝友個個初次見面
,陪著笑臉被抽水很多遍
,但同場有個西裝友有白澈的臉
,樣子正經 也不似樣賤賤
,更加有書生氣質古裝片裏面
,喝過兩杯就紅了一臉
,就坐到你面前
,點點你的臉
,你說只有最愛才能掂這塊面
,這晚是被逼來浪費睡眠
,油尖旺金毛玲 這夜有心事
,不知跟他何能再見面
,拿起 Seven 買野賬單的背面
,寫了句句哼起小曲後入眠
,偷偷唱著這曲幻想他聽見
,學下吉他中環賣唱太痴纏
,再見不到也許人生少不免
,但金毛玲何事秋風悲畫扇
,年少随半茶半啡喝掉 轻将烟圈吐
,喝完半茶半酒醉掉 人生一半抵销
,原来得一半是无聊 遗失一半哭笑
,球赛 随半场半边对调 攻守双方转了
,爱情要来半推半就 唇边一半开口
,来寻得一半换自由 这一半得救
,
,谁坐在旁饮一半美酒
,谁愿在旁分一半喜一半愁
,谁愿在旁守就算疯癫衣衫褴褛
,共步起点总会有 未达终点半路己失救
,神要尘世成半黑半白 火光黑影对照
,我和你求半醒半梦 寻找一半相拥
,和谐的一半是服从 加一半失控
,谁坐在旁饮一半美酒
,谁愿在旁分一半喜一半愁
,谁愿在旁守就算疯癫衣衫褴褛
,共步起点总会有 去到终点
,有谁共坐崖边 分一半韆鞦
,谁愿在坟边一半走一半留
,谁愿共留守就算荒岛只得半亩
,髮鬓稀疏一半柳 这首歌给你就算唱半首
,
,齐树敌同握一半匕首
,谁落力来沟一半水一半油
,谁愿在旁守就算一夫当关搏斗
,共步终点总会有
,半世几多半疑半信争斗

,最爱 你浅笑的脸 如眉头和额角也在笑
,让我惊觉有看下去的需要
,我却怕这个需要 吓怕精致的你 沉默了
,吓得你 不再浅笑 不得了
,我哪会不顾一切 胆小成问题 太弱了
,是妄想太过 到尽处 是寂寥
,我最爱感觉飘渺 如无从着地 又太累了
,怕想到这里哭了 多可笑 凝眸的一息间 不得了
,我最怕一再想起 似天空清澈的你
,又有哪个可比 悠然自得呼吸吞吐的你
,似看破生死 灵魂共振似碰到太惊喜
,夏至秋天的距离 月与倒影的距离
,犹如站在 远方的你
,爱意似心里郁结 然而重游旧地 又怕-遇见
,是你吗 细碎故事再 想一遍
,怕我太兴奋不已 说抱歉 讲几次 太在意
,说穿了 这个郁结 可不可以
,我最怕一再想起 似天空清澈的你
,又有哪个可比 悠然自得呼吸吞吐的你
,似看破生死 灵魂共振似碰到太惊喜
,若你依稀一皱眉 我在半空 降落何地
,我最爱一再想起 细声称呼我的你
,放肆跟我一起 连沉默光阴都可以很美
,未当我知己 情愿别心急这刻揭穿你
,用最安好的距离 未会牵手的距离
,凝视近在 前方的你

,牛顿说有种吸引 角力至今
,苹果导致思考最大原因
,地壳的吸引
,如果有一双翅膀我就会飞
,离开地面一刻已是完美
,尚欠好天气
,永远欠缺了一个痛快理由
,脱去这世界吸引力的咀咒
,什么不够 什么都不够
,离开所有 才得到所有
,要去到最远高呼我已自由
,于漆黑之中亲手捕捉星宿
,目标只有 无约束的去
,离开地球 无憾的出走
,漫步月球
,离开了这种束缚我就会飞
,燃点倒数升空告别大气
,于天外可找到名胜
,俯瞰极光跨过绝岭
,星际历险之旅由我见证
,永远欠缺了一个痛快理由
,抗拒这世界将失控的咀咒

,无药可救 携梦想出走

,兜兜转转漂泊到现在
,分针短针表圈中竞赛
,看似有尽了梦见的将来
,今天应该高兴满自在
,得到掌声欢呼与被爱
,人生已跨越几番波折障碍赛
,何时学会不再讲 不要讲
,心底裡那份迷茫
,捆绑感动的感觉 没法讲
,良缘遇上不再多 却想结果
,焦急裡寻觅 愈来愈错
,几乎忘掉了最想栽种的果
,唱著幸福之歌
,眼泪有否沉没
,无数次失望的眼神与落魄
,旋律溶掉惊慌
,拥抱顷刻无悔的画面
,爱是苦中亦能笑著满足
,感动总不远 也许下一秒盛放
,一生中几多过客探访
,几多数不清疯癫错过
,世界每秒转动没法劝阻
,能捧腹开心欢笑已稀罕
,疲奔于攀登高峰找答案
,穷一世心力换取一秒领略爱
,从头学过可以麽 你可以麽
,开始这试炼堂课
,解开心头的枷锁 路更广
,随缘遇到总更多 结会结的果
,焦急裡寻觅 只会愈错
,奢求曾令你错种需要的果
,从无求到渴求 直到渴求整个宇宙
,来到最后却只想得救
,忙著拥有 忘掉你我本都一无所有
,想像于不远某位能跟你和唱

,今朝一早起身　日复日又返学
,这种感觉　无数想法很想挥霍
,孭起灰色背包　又踏着这街道
,几多相似　谁也知道这很枯燥
,这段路　走了至少九百遍
,谁会感受　你听到的看的每位过路人
,都市呼吸声　又会是谁想听
,走过急速旅程　要得到什么高兴
,星空中　刻了几千亿姓名
,放胆挥霍　谁敢说你这生枉过
,闹钟一响我返嚟现实世界
,返学嚟讲无野一定要带
,大致重复既生活　重复到周末
,快要遗忘掉最简单嘅微笑
,细个听故事细听得太多
,大个再听过大不如最初
,每一个小故事好似隆重嘅嘉宾
,而家所有野普通过路边嘅街灯
,这街灯很勇敢　站在马路中照亮路人
,挨过风雨都不抖震
,追忆街名半生　未惧现实厄运
,小巷穿插　尝试考究他的吸引
,车厢中　走马看花经过了
,忘记感受　闭起眼睛细听被雨打的声音
,都市呼吸声　又会是谁想听
,走过急速旅程　要得到什么高兴
,星空中　刻了几千亿姓名
,放胆挥霍　谁敢说你这生枉过
,每一个你　抬头都有天空一块
,拼拼埋埋　拼埋先系呢个世界
,细细静静听城市既呼吸声
,轻轻夹杂老电车声“叮叮”
,“唔该借借”推撞事故背后故事
,顾住赶时间　流逝时间嘅意义
,太多事物系我地身边度擦过
,唔啱听嘅音乐可以随意地插播
,都市呼吸声　又会是谁想听
,走过急速旅程　要得到什么高兴
,星空中　刻了几千亿姓名
,放胆挥霍　谁敢说你这生枉过
,呼吸声　又会是谁想听
,（我地想法会系古古怪怪系因为我地想睇多啲呢个世界）
,走过急速旅程要得到什么高兴
,（但系个世界就教我地炎凉世态　太多野想试就想像得番今次）
,星空中刻了几千亿姓名
,（我地感想　系勇敢去想　想相信个世界可以唔止咁样）
,天空一块　合并出这个世界
,（天空一块　拼拼凑凑拼凑埋　呢个世界）

,如若我去唱出新主张
,不需鼓掌 不需音响
,若我要唱出新思想
,高声去唱 阻止围墙 扩张
,It's my showtime
,Let me show you how I kick this rhyme
,舞台同擂台一样 讲求优胜劣败 一沈百踩
,弱者注定被淘汰
,我艺高人胆大 玩踩界
,个节奏越来越快
,台上我唱得越痛快
,我敢唱 其他人唔敢唱嘅歌
,咁嘅歌 我敢唱
,而且唱得比其他人多
,我嘅歌你听咗
,但系我嘅Show 你未睇过
,咁你错过咗 唔只系一个Show
,而系错过见证我如何将极限突破
,Chorus

,ONE for the money
,TWO for the show
,THREE for the people
,Now Lets go!
,我开Show可能冇人会到
,就算现场一个现众都冇
,就算我唱到声都冇
,我做嘅每一场Show
,我都尽全力 当系最后一场咁做
,我用MC做正职 就系要做得称职
,做音乐得一个目的
,要你哋对Hip Hop重新认识
,所有人 即管视我为流行公敌
,你有你嘅攻击
,我会系舞台建立最丰高嘅功绩
,Chorus
,如若我去唱出新主张

,若我要唱出新思想
,高声去唱 阻止围墙 扩张……
,听紧呢只歌 你哋要举手
,睇我唱紧呢只歌 你哋要举手
,如果支持我 你哋要举手
,你哋要举手 举到只歌最后
,我喺条街度开始第一次
,我喺度一直试
,去到直至有我红馆嘅第一次
,我要试 我要知 我要你地都知
,我可以 你可以 冇人能够阻止
,Bridge
,寻觅创新 属于打破封建
,让我唱出 得到赞赏
,谁说最终 定必失去主见
,不甘失去 只要高声歌唱

,换了你是我　你忍得到吗

,人生太早已看得化　也可怕
,回头望　伴你走　从来未曾幸福过
,赴过汤　蹈过火　沿途为何没爱河

,没有心 别再拖 好心一早放开我
,重头努力也坎坷　统统不要好过
,来年岁月那么多　为继续而继续

,年纪还细喜欢喝醉
,到　脚步渐踌躇　几经转伴侣

,干一杯　青春的哭笑也送走它
,连场风雨也净化　和平相处变得优雅
,年华会酿制幸福的精髓那会枉花　过去代价　
,甦醒了喝啖暖汤　认真思索挂念着谁
,年少野性终于过去
,花心血拼命去追　换得虚脱和憔悴
,而感情已消失哪里
,到　向现实投降　几经转伴侣

,由时间酿制自己的酒会灌溉鲜花
,如明日八十岁　活过便满足对着你悠然而心安
,当初的一股劲莽撞　今天的哲学

The world can’t stop me now…

Closed minds, loud mouths
It echoes in our town
We stand alone atop the hill of honest hearts

I’ve fallen apart, learnt to keep it all together
I’ve walked n the dark, with my eyes closed anyways…

We find meaning in ourselves… 

The World can’t stop me now… 

Judging eyes, twisted lies weighing us down
But we pull up; inspire hope to the ones we love

I’ve been pushed around, But I pulled myself together
I’ve been cut down, but I grew stronger anyways…

Embrace the enemies in ourselves… 

The World can’t stop me now… 
When you look into our eyes you’ll see
The spirits that will plant the seeds
And pave the way for all to call this home

In between the moon and satellites 
Ride the streak of light from a distant time

I’ll taste the sky again
With the world right beneath me
I’ll come shooting down 
And eclipse the sun and know
Nothing will stop us now
Nothing will stop us now!

,Too late for us to change the palette.
,Painting the sky,the sun,the planet.
,Filling the world with color.
,Looking more closely,maybe we'll find
,It's spilled past through the border.
,I can be free!(Free...)
,I can be free if I want to be.(Want to be...)
,I can be free to finally see.(You'll see...)
,Soon enough I know I can be the one I'm meant to be.
,And I know I can show you...
,You can be free!(Free...)
,You can be free if you want to be.(Want to be...
,You can be free to finally see(Believe...)
,We don't need to be scared.
,Banish thought of fears you've kept tpward your unknown qualities.
,When we find we're alone
,We just fall down and lose ourselves inside the dark.
,There's no need to be scared.
,Take my hand and we'll get out.
,You can be free!
,You can be free if you want to be.
,You can be free to finally see
,Soon enough I know you can believe in who you'll be.
,And I know I can show you!
,We can be free!
,We can be free if we want to be.
,We can be free to finally see
,Who we are without pause if we could just try it!
,Open our minds and just believe!

,I stand behind these lies
,While I fall apart inside
,There's no one to tell me why
,Did I ever close my eyes to see？
,Colours seem to fade
,To this melancholy state
,Who says what am I to change？
,Did I ever take the time to breathe？
,Can you keep me in the dark
,And never let me see
,The light can be so much worse
,And I feel it slip away
,One last good memory
,Our time has come and gone
,I'm fading away
,A little bit closer
,To that moment
,I'm standing next to you
,But I know
,How this story will unfold
,A litte bit farther
,Till I'm caught up
,To what I'm running from
,But I know the end
,It always ends with you
,Try to hold onto the pain
,The one thing that won't change
,It's keeping me grounded
,And the one reality
,Starts slipping away
,And crumbles all around me
,I'm fading away
,A little bit closer
,To that moment
,I'm standing next to you
,But I know
,How this story will unfold
,A litte bit farther
,Till I'm caught up
,To what I'm running from
,But I know the end
,It always ends with you
,I stand behind these lies
,While I fall apart inside
,There's no one to tell me why
,Did I ever close my eyes to see？
,Colours seem to fade
,To this melancholy state
,Who says what am I to change？
,A little bit closer
,To that moment
,I'm standing next to you
,But I know
,How this story will unfold
,A little bit jaded
,Can't take it
,There's only one way out
,So I know the end
,It always ends with you

,Loved you once and again.
,I'd become just your plaything.
,Nothing had mattered that night
,And I realize I had been pulled by your whims.
,This gravity is crushing me.
,The exit's not here and so much doubt falls on me.
,No matter how or when I shout,
,I wonder if I can be heard.
,I'm breaking down,
,And no one understands
,That I'm lost in some abyss.
,It's getting dark
,And panic's setting in.
,I am faced with the end of the world.
,I just can't understand.
,Deep inside, there is wanting.
,Sounds that I've all but shut out
,Echoes hollow, unbound. Now I am trapped in a mist.
,This heaviness is drowning me.
,I'm slow, can't control the actions I am fighting.
,I'm grasping at distorted glass.
,I wonder if I can be seen.
,I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
,Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
,And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
,Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?
,I've fallen behind in this revolving city.
,Reality is like a dream.
,I wonder if I can exist.
,I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
,This sight I see is confusing me.
,I've fallen behind in this revolving city.
,Reality is like a dream.
,I wonder if I can exist.
,I can't stop myself from looking behind from the end,
,Reaching around so blindingly till I start to bend.
,And I'm standing, surrounded, so close to the edge.
,Tumbling down forever, will I ever find any solace?
,Even as I fall,
,I'll spread my wings and soar.
,And I know it's not the end.
,It's breaking out.
,This feeling's setting in.
,I am faced with a sudden silence.

,When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I started really to play the guitar.
,I definitely wanted to become a musician.
,It was almost impossible because it was, because the dream was so big.
,I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town.
,I was starting and when I finally broke away from school and became musician.
,I thought "Well, I may have a bit of a chance."
,Because all I ever wanted to do is music but not only play music but compose music.
,At that time, in Germany, in 1969-70, they already had discotheques
,So I would take my car and go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes
,I think I had about 7-8 songs.
,I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home
,and that helped me for about almost two years to survive.
,In the beginning,
,I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s,
,the sounds of the 60s, of the 70s,
,and then have a sound of the future.
,I know the synthesizer, "Why don't I use the synthesizer?",
,which is the sound of the future.
,And I didn't have any idea what to do
,but I knew I needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track
,which was then synced to the moog modular.
,I knew that it could be a sound of the future
,but I didn't realize how much impact it would be.
,My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everyone's calling me Giorgio.
,
,You want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and music being correct,
,you can do whatever you want.
,So nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.

,I didn't wanna be the one to forget
,I thought of everything I'd never regret
,A little time with you is all that I get
,That's all we need because it's all we can take
,One thing I never see, the same when you 'round
,I don't believe in him - his slips on ground
,I wanna take you to that place near the "Roche"
,But no one gives us any time anymore
,He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
,You made an offer for it, then you ran off
,I got this picture of us kids in my head
,And all I hear is the last thing that you said
,I listened to your problems, now listen to mine
,I didn't want to anymore
,And we will never be alone again
,Cause it doesn't happen everyday
,Kinda counted on you being a friend
,Can I give it up or give it away?
,Now I thought about what I wanna say
,But I never really know where to go
,So I changed myself to a friend
,Cause I know it unlocks like a door
,And we will never be alone again
,Cause it doesn't happen everyday
,Kinda counted on you being a friend
,Can I give it up or give it away?
,Now I thought about what I wanna say
,But I never really know where to go
,So I changed myself to a friend
,Still one more again
,It didn't matter what they wanted to see
,He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
,The summer memory that just never dies
,We worked too long and hard to give it no time
,He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
,Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
,He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall
,He cannot break it down or else he would fall
,One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
,Take it, I don't want to sing anymore
,I listened to your problems, now listen to mine
,I didn't want to anymore
,And we will never be alone again
,Cause it doesn't happen everyday
,Kinda counted on you being a friend
,Can I give it up or put it away?
,Now I thought about what I wanna say
,But I never really know where to go
,So I changed myself to a friend
,Cause I know it unlocks like a door...
,And we will never be alone again
,Cause it doesn't happen everyday
,Kinda counted on you being a friend
,Can I give it up or put it away?
,Now I thought about what I wanna say
,But I never really know where to go
,So I changed myself to a friend
,Cause I know it unlocks like a door
,I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you
,We're swimming around, it's all I do when I'm with you
,And we will never be alone again
,Cause it doesn't happen everyday
,Kinda counted on you being a friend
,Can I give it up or give it away?
,Now I thought about what I wanna say

What is happening here
Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party
It's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling

The people startin' a climb the walls 
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball

Everybody start to lose control
When the music is right
If you see somebody hangin' around
Don't get uptight
The only thing we want to do tonight
Is go 'round and 'round
And turn upside down 

Don't hold back
'Cause ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party
We only want to get down

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Say what?
Can't stop now
Just getting started
Everybody clap your hands
Everybody let's dance

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

,Installed in our minds and attempting
,To hold us back
,Weve got to take it back
,cause holes in our spirit causin tears and fears
,One-sided stories for years and years and years

,But the lesson plan he cant recall
,The students eyes dont perceive the lies
,Bouning off every fucking wall
,
,His composure is well kept
,I guess he fears playing the fool
,sit The complacent students and listen to some of that
,Bullshit that he learned in school
,Europe aint my rope to swing on
,Cant learn a thing from it
,Yet we hang from it
,Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
,Like the motherfuckin weathermen
,To expose and close the doors on those who try
,To strangle and mangle the truth
,cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
,We gotta take the power back
,Yeah, we gotta take the power back

,Why  don't  you  listen  to  me  when  I  try  to  talk  to  you
,Stop  thinking  of  yourself,for  just  a  second  fool
,Shut  up,shut  up,I  don't  wanna  hear  your  mouth
,Your  mother  made  a  monster,now  get  the  hell  out  of  my  house
,Can't  stand  it  for  another  day
,I  ain't  gonna  live  my  life  this  way
,Cold  sweat,my  fists  are  clenching
,Stomp,stomp,stomp  the  idiot  convention
,Which  one  of  these  words  don't  you  understand
,I'm  Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,Talking  to  you  is  like  clapping  with  one  hand
,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,Don't  tell  me  how  to  do  my  job
,There's  the  door,your  name's  on  the  knob
,You're  always  in  the  way,like  a  beast  on  my  back
,Were  you  dropped  as  a  baby,cause  brains  you  lack
,Can't  stand  it  for  another  day
,I  ain't  gonna  live  my  life  this  way
,Cold  sweat,my  fists  are  clenching
,Stomp,stomp,stomp,the  idiot  convention
,Which  one  of  these  words  don't  you  understand?

,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,What  is  it?--Caught  in  a  Mosh!
,Think-before  you  speak
,Or  suffer  for  your  words
,Learn,to  give  respect
,That  others,give  to  you
,AAAAAAAAAAAh,The  best  you  can  do
,Hey  Man!
,I'm  trying  to  reason  but  you  don't  understand
,Talking  in  circles,we'll  never  get  it  straight
,Just  you  and  me  in  our  theatre  of  hate
,Can't  stand  it  for  another  day
,I  ain't  gonna  live  my  life  this  way
,Cold  sweat,my  fists  are  clenching

,Anti-Flag The Press Corpse Lyrics
,The (Downing Street) memo says...
,...We gotta work to make the facts fit
,the false charges
,Pull the wool over the eyes of
,the filthy masses
,Stab the people in the back for
,the corporate choice
,Roll the propaganda out using
,The People's Voice
,We don't want to talk about it...
,The press scribble scribble
,every half-truth spoke
,Then shoot it round the country
,like an April Fools joke
,Hype the nation
,for a Desert Storm love affair
,Wave the stars and stripes
,like you just don't care!
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,And on the TV screen...
,...Diversion and aversion
,is the flavor of the day
,Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
,Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
,The White House Press Corpse
,only has one thing to say...
,"We don't want to talk about it!"
,The White House boils over
,"Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
,The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing
,the White House song
,While over in Iraq thousands
,are dead because of lies
,The spineless war
,drumming-press corpse have taken lives
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,
,Fires fueled on endless lies
,Black shrouds coat desert skies
,A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
,As embeds report what they're fed
,
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,the night and crawls into the day
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute

,oh Sweety I miss you
,you change the direction of my life
,oh nothing's gonna change my love for you forever
,oh nothing’s gonna change my heart beating for you forever

,这是树叶，吹过的声音
,这是小河，流过的声音
,在我眼里，哪里都一样
,只担心自己，有一个没有你的未来
,有一天我走着，跑着，奔向了远方
,远方的花朵和想象中一样绚烂
,山的那边，海的那边，有一个女孩
,我只是远远的看着，呼吸着无奈
,耳边传来，一百个声音
,说着走吧，走吧，走吧
,
,
,
,
,
,我们不去歌唱生活的理想
,在落着尘土的路边数着票子
,把落着尘土的票子放进口袋
,骑着电动三轮车在路上兜风
,凌晨的三点起床 匆匆赶往批发市场
,在寒冷冷的雾气中 点燃一只香烟
,路边的风景行人和车辆 其实在每一天
,人生似乎就这样停留不前
,早晨的油锅冒着青烟
,买油条的人们和我轻声交谈
,今天的西红柿是如此的鲜
,今天的樱桃是那么的甜
,报纸上总在说股票战争和保险
,我其实只想看一看 昨天谜语的答案
,那个唠叨的阿婆 她再也没有出现
,倒是有个年轻的小姑娘 在对面新开了一家豆腐店
,你们去追逐你们
,复杂的成功和名利
,我们来贩卖我们
,简单的岁月和生活

,They came for him one winter's night.
,Arrested, he was bound.
,They said there'd been a robbery,
,his pistol had been found.
,They marched him to the station house,
,he waited for the dawn.
,And as they led him to the dock,
,he knew that he'd been wronged.
,"You stand accused of robbery,"
,he heard the bailiff say.
,He knew without an alibi,
,tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
,Over the hills and far away,
,for ten long years he'll count the days.
,Over the mountains and the seas,
,a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
,He knew that it would cost him dear,
,but yet he dare not say.
,Where he had been that fateful night,
,a secret it must stay.
,He had to fight back tears of rage.
,His heart beat like a drum.
,For with the wife of his best friend,
,he spent his final night of freedom.
,Over the hills and far away,
,he swears he will return one day.
,Far from the mountains and the seas,
,back in her arms he swears he'll be.
,Over the hills and far away.
,Over the hills and,
,over the hills and,
,over the hills and far away.
,Each night within his prison cell,
,he looks out through the bars.
,He reads the letters that she wrote.
,One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
,Over the hills and far away,
,she prays he will return one day.
,As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
,back in his arms he swears she'll be.

,And I just can't keep living this way
,So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
,I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
,I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
,I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
,Tryin' to put my life back together right now
,It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
,Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
,So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
,And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
,I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
,I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
,My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
,And drop dead, no more beef flingers
,No more drama, from now I wanna promise to focus only
,On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
,And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
,'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
,Or the corner club and lift the whole liquour counter up
,'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
,But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'
,And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
,To take a stand, to take a stand
,Everybody, everybody
,Come take my hand, come take my hand
,We'll walk this route together through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
,Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
,
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off of love, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going?
,"I'm leaving you"
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great
,I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
,But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped
,Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even knows what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
,You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em
,Throw 'em down pin 'em
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's the rage that took over it controls you both
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over, it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pane
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,I'm just gonna
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

Lips feel just like cherry
Angels and thats why I'm screeching
What I wait among the pressure
Jump and sing for lure a pedon
Body freeze and I pitch you up
Then boy, easy flick her off
Cause of this some girls get envy
Even then try mess up your party
Love, but be warned if you beat me
There is no need to compete
, 2x
So me I chill in the VIP suite
See my DJ playing my beat
Every newscast adverting me
The dancefloor is where we will meet
All over the world, they're feeling
Is so sweet, MIB
Pop Style, well I'm free
All jealousy, is for me
Their contribution fell on the finite
Why you're smiling? Cause of my defeat
Left all the love alit by the magic
Then when I boom, then when I freak
Find my commotions gone through my teeth
Working the last of style for a beat
Bow now break to be the elite
Jealousy I'll be nice and sweet

,And you think I'm crazy
,Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
,I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
,Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey
,Wanted to receive attention for my music
,Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
,For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
,Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
,When I blew; see, but it was confusing
,'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
,Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
,Hit the lottery, oh wee
,But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
,It was like winning a used mink
,Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
,I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
,Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith

,So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
,(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
,No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
,I think it went wandering off down yonder and stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
,'Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
,And save me from myself and all this conflict
,'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
,My OCD's conking me in the head
,Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
,I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
,Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

,And you think I'm crazy
,Yeah, you think I'm crazy
,Well, that's not fair
,Well, that's not fair

,One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
,But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
,MC's, blood get spilled and I'll
,Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
,Give every kid who got played that
,Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
,To the kids who played him
,I ain't here to save the fucking children
,But if one kid out of a hundred million

,It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back

,Every New Year we know the ball drops at midnight.
,These are the things I cannot change
,yet it feels so odd and strange
,how relationships never stay
,let me count the ways...
,If only I'd held you tighter at the horror show.
,Kept a secret for so long that you'd never know.
,If only I'd shut the door after you got in.
,Threw my arm out at the game and let you win.
,Picked up every tab （when you're happy when you're sad）.
,Left you all alone when you were mad.
,Showed up at your door with flowers when you were scared
,all the little things to let you know I cared （and I cared）.
,
,Never was when you weren't on my mind
,together was where we stood in time
,another day the sun would shine.

,and said our friendship's here to stay.
,I never wanted it that way.

,There's no feeling I can obtain to see you
,from a different point of view.
,Still you come around.
,I know I'll see you at our show.
,
,I'll cry for this eyesore.
,You'll come back- I won't be there...

,Today is a winding road
,that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
,Whoa （whoa' whoa' whoa）
,Today in the blink of an eye
,I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
,I tried
,I tried to read between the lines
,I tried to look in your eyes
,I want a simple explanation
,For what I'm feeling inside
,I gotta find a way out
,Maybe there's a way out
,Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
,Do you know you're unlike any other?
,You'll always be my thunder' and I said
,Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
,I don't wanna ever love another
,You'll always be my thunder
,So bring on the rain
,And bring on the thunder
,Today is a winding road
,Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
,Whoa （whoa' whoa' whoa）
,Today I'm on my own
,I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
,I don't know （I don't know' I don't know' I don't know）
,And now I'm itching for the tall grass
,And longing for the breeze
,I need to step outside
,Just to see if I can breathe
,I gotta find a way out
,Maybe theres a way out
,Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
,Do you know you're unlike any other?
,You'll always be my thunder' and I said
,Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
,I don't wanna ever love another
,You'll always be my thunder
,So bring on the rain
,Yeah I'm walking on a tightrope
,I'm wrapped up in vines
,I think we'll make it out
,But you just gotta give me time
,Strike me down with lightning
,Let me feel you in my veins
,I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain
,Today is a winding road
,that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go

,Oh baby bring on the pain
,And listen to the thunder
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practice all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay cause I got no self esteem

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care 
Right? Yeah yeah yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem
  Lie low,lilo 
 
 Lilo start to pack,coz you're never coming back 
 You've gone too far by stealing cars,you are a foolish chap 
 A thief before a man,nicking airbeds from Taiwan 
 Destined for a life of crime,no friends or pension plan 
 
 Now what's he supposed to do? 
 He's goona be caught up with soon 
 And then he'll sing a different tune with the jailbirds whoa-oh 
 Bad luck it's not his day,he'll be found and put away 
 A hefty price he'll have to pay,a lesson learnt 
 
 Lie low,Lilo 
 
 You never had a job,coz it's easier to rob 
 Petty crim'thieving's your thing,then someone had to dob 
 Lie low,no more fun,a kleptomaniac is on the run 
 Someone help him please or else he's gonna come undone 
 
 I know that he'll pinch an inch to swipe a mile 
 Lilo is that kind of guy 
 Although we have been best mates for quite a while 
 And so he goes inside

,Don't leave me lonely baby
,Here in my blurry condition
,I hide myself in the room and

,Just to see, just to see
,
,If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me
,But I lost my faith as I lost my way
,
,It's not the street that's made of concrete
,It's you, it's you
,Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view
,I had never taken more than I give to you
,I was led astray and I lost my way
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,It's not the light that casts the shadow
,It's doubt, it's doubt
,As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about
,
,I had never fought as hard though as I do for you
,I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone

,I got so much more than I bargained for...

,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Hey baby
,Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
,She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
,Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
,Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
,It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
,So baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,She was sippin’ on southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
,We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
,She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
,"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
,It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
,So baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,When that summer sun fell to its knees
,I looked at her and she looked at me
,And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
,Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
,I put it in park and
,Grabbed my guitar
,And strummed a couple chords
,And sang from the heart
,Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin’
,Hell I can’t get you out of my head
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
,It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
,Come on
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Come on girl
,Get those windows down and cruise
,Aww yea
,If you've been just staring at the sunrise above this hollow town
,been chasing empty memories, the kind that's keeping you down
,can't seem to find your strife, just trying to live your life
,been feeling suffocated, searching for vindication
,
,this sense of indecision ain't what we had in mind
,the dream that I envisioned, I am still hoping to find
,you ain't done nothing wrong but we ain't done nothing right
,I know that something's missing
,
,but the world will keep on turning turning
,you gotta keep that fire burning burning
,I know you think you're in a hurry
,there's no need to worry
,cause I can feel it turning turning
,our luck is turning around
,
,chasing these empty verses, some rows have crooked signs
,we're losing all this daylight but soon the moon's gonna rise
,these final puzzle pieces, we tried but they're too tight
,but if we ease the pressure, I bet they'll fit just right
,
,sometimes it takes some patience, sometimes it works first try
,but I know that this is worth it, cause this dream's too strong to die
,I ain't done nothing wrong but we ain't done nothing right
,one day we'll find what's missing
,
,but the world will keep on turning turning
,you gotta keep that fire burning burning
,I know you think you're in a hurry
,there's no need to worry
,cause I can feel it turning turning
,our luck is turning around
,
,I've been in, I've been out
,I've been low, beaten down
,I've been lost now I'm found
,this fire is burning us
,still staring at the sunrise, missing that hollow town
,feeling those empty memories but nothing's holding me down
,I hope you find your strife, just go and live your life
,I'm feeling vindicated
,the world will keep on turning turning
,you better keep that fire burning burning
,I know you think you're in a hurry
,there's no need to worry
,cause I can feel it turning turning
,our luck is turning around (turning turning)
,our luck is turning around (turning turning)
,our luck is turning around (turning turning)
,I've been in, I've been out
,I've been low, beaten down
,I've been lost now I'm found
,our luck is turning around
,It's hard to hear you through the awkward silence, cuz
,It's doesn't happen often
,Guess you're busy everyday
,I woke up feeling sick about the way we've been for days
,I guess things changed
,I guess we've changed
,I feel you slippin'
,See you drifting
,You are slipping... away
,And I cannot make you stay
,I hate to think that I'm the one to blame
,You have to see the ugly face
,I make before I start to cry
,You need me to grow up
,I guess that's more than fair enough
,If I just try my best
,Will these all disappear
,I feel you slippin'
,See you drifting
,You are slipping... away
,I feel you slippin'
,See you drifting
,You are slipping... away
,And I cannot make you
,Quietly.. you say it all when how your eyes speak
,Telling me to leave silently
,And my heart will break
,When little things start to go wrong
,Said you've questioned love too long
,Baby now you know why I write sad songs
,(That's) all I can sing
,I feel you slippin
,See you drifting
,You are slipping... away
,I feel you slippin
,See you drifting
,You are slipping... away
,And I cannot make you stay

,I want to hide the truth

,There’s nowhere we can hide
,No matter what we breed
,We still are made of greed
,This is my kingdom come

,When the curtain’s call
,Is the last of all
,When the lights fade out
,All the sinners crawl
,So they dug your grave
,And the masquerade
,Will come calling out
,At the mess you made
,Don’t want to let you down
,But I am hell bound
,Though this is all for you
,Don't wanna hide the truth

,There's a man on my street
,He reminds me everyday
,Better take what you can get
,Cause there's nothing more than this
,Daylight fades into the ground,
,Oh Lord I need you now
,Cover me with the red sky tonight
,The promise of a better day to come
,Sing over me an angelic symphony
,Tell me everything will be alright
,With the red sky tonight
,We're so taking with our fear
,Now we're folded up in shame
,With our feet nailed to the floor
,We're the only ones to blame
,I can't help but wonder why
,Nobody bats an eye
,You can see it in the faces
,Of all the passers by
,Cover me with the red sky tonight
,The promise of a better day to come
,Sing over me an angelic symphony
,Tell me everything will be alright
,I sail into the sun
,When the day is done
,I need you in the night
,So wake me in the dark
,I see you in the sun
,When the day is done
,Cover me with the red sky tonight
,I promise a better day will come
,Sing over me an angelic symphony
,Tell me everything will be alright
,Tell me everything will be alright
,Tell me everything will be alright
,It's the red sky
,It's the red sky

,Safe and free
,knowing that you're here with me
,And in your arms
,I know that nothing could be wrong
,In your eyes
,I know I'm right where I belong
,And even if the suns not burning bright
,I'll be safe by your side
,Even if the stars don't shine tonight
,I can see. You're my light
,Late at night
,I step inside my writing room
,All alone
,I channel all the things you do
,I'll Write it down
,into my journal filled with you
,And Write for hours
,Any little thing that rings of true.
,And even if the suns not burning bright
,I'll be safe by your side

,Someone who believes in me
,Admires all my deepest dreams
,I know i couldn't do this all alone
,I can't see
,exactly what you see in me
,Could it be
,that you're seeing things that I can’t see
,I'll supply
,all the pretty things i think you need
,At least I'll try
,with simple words and melodies
,even if the suns not burning bright
,I'll be safe by your side
,Even if the stars don't shine tonight
,I can see. You're my light
,even if the suns not burning bright
,I'll be safe by your side

,Light is coming
,through my window
,I know I'll be alright
,Light is coming
,through my window
,I can see my light
,
,I got my shades on top
,Back rolling with the music jacked
,One on the wheel, one around you baby.
,
,Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
,Shining off the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride,
,Breeze blowing in, your hair blowing round
,You're scanning through the stations
,Looking for that country sound.
,The good stuff iced up in the back seat
,Nowhere to go, nowhere to be.
,I got my shades on top
,Back rolling with the music, jacked
,One on the wheel, one around you baby.
,Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
,Sure enough, tangled up, and laid back and lazy.
,Pour it on easy now,
,Don't spill a bit!
,Nothing but time tonight,
,Let's get to killing it!
,Long as I'm rocking with you
,Girl, you know I'm cool with
,Just chillin’ it!
,
,Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
,Girl, you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
,You got me high on kisses, you got me missing signs
,Hard looking left when my world is on my right
,I got my shades on top
,Back rolling with the music, jacked
,One on the wheel, one around you baby.
,Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
,Sure enough, tangled up, and laid back and lazy.

,Nothing like a little you and me low key
,Right now I'm right where I wanna be
,I got my shades on top

,my baby that night.
,I lifted her head'
,she looked at me and said'
,"Hold me darlin just a little while."
,I held her close'
,I kissed her--our last kiss.
,I'd found the love

,I fell too far, was in way too deep.
,Guess I let you get the best of me.

,A lot of others opened up,
,So did my eyes so I could see

,I saw my name on a grave stone, out the window by the funeral procession
,And all I wanted was a ride home, so we could get messed up at the reception
,Now summer was hanging her head, was hanging on like a child before bed
,All I wanted to do was get through and catch your eye, the same feeling from you
,Lets get tangled up tonight
,Girl you could floor me now, with just one bat of your eyelash, so when you stare me down
,I'm hoping that I blink, blink last
,Lets get it now, lets get it now, lets get at it, get at it
,Don't wanna wait for this fate to fit it in, don't wanna wait for this fate to fit it in
,Tomorrow is far from tonight, lets get it right, get at it, get at it, get it right tonight
,It's called a quick fix, but ain't this a quick life
,Saw my name on a grave stone, told you twice as my face goes white
,I told myself not to get grave stoned, so I'm gonna get happy tonight
,Now we're looking for a corner instead she said, I'm tugging her clothes but I'm no child before bed
,Lets make it quick and nobody will know, I'll show you slow later, lets get a fix of each other and out
,from under this table
,Straighten up our clothes, this is how the night goes

,You are the camera light, the only thing to make me wanna smile tonight
,I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough of you

,Lost my way, well I was fighting the time.
,A big black cloud, stormy sky.
,Followed me, while I was living a lie.
,So heartless, so selfish, so in darkness, when all your nights are Starless,
,You're running outta hope.
,But I found the strength inside to see, found the better part of me,
,And I'll never let it go.

,When you're gone for a day, on your own.
,Tear your heart out just to find your way home.

,I've come so far, with nothing to show, for it.
,Mistaken, I got so good at taking,
,But now I'm tired of faking.

,南方的小镇阴雨的冬天没有北方冷

,夜空的北斗也没有让她找到迷途的方向
,阳光里她在院子中央晾晒着衣裳
,在四季的风中她散着头发安慰着时光

,南方姑娘 你说今天你就要回到你的家乡
,思念让人心伤 她呼唤着你的泪光
,南方的果子已熟 那是最简单的理想

,老城的样子依旧很土
,红色的砖墙和泛黄的老屋
,像我童年时那件蓝迪卡衣服
,风尘仆仆又缝缝补补
,老城的故事还在重复
,河边的垂柳和弯弯的小路
,那是人们远方寻梦的出口
,也是漂泊的人最后的归途
,这里的老人依旧守在老地方
,老街坊依然淳朴善良
,这里没有外面的世界光彩夺目
,他却值得我用尽一生回顾
,村委会的大喇叭不再响起
,那个红领巾少年不知去向哪里
,你曾多少次路过你本拥有的地方
,有多少人在回途迷了路
,童声：静夜思
, 床前明月光，疑是地上霜
, 举头望明月，低头思故乡
,九六年八岁的小草你还好么
,记忆里碎花的裙子
,和你可爱的虎牙
,不知道什么时候再没见过你
,当年的小情话就落在心里吧
,别乡的雨季老城下了吗
,梦里总听到外婆说天凉了加件衣服吧
,我们总是忙碌 不停的忙碌
,如今再听不到 外婆的叮嘱
,我们穷极一生去追求的生活
,回过头看看只不过大梦一场
,童年的那些朋友你们都在哪
,如今你们过得好么
,我们穷极一生去追求的生活
,回过头看看只不过大梦一场
,好好去珍惜身边的人吧
,错过便是一生

,穿越一场暴风雨
,越是下不完的雨
,走不完的一条路
,做不完的一场梦
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要笑的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着你回家
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要哭的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着你回家
,这不息的一场雨
,吹进灵魂里的寒
,无法原谅你自己
,带着倦意走下去
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要笑的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着你回家
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要哭的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着你回家
,一声汽笛声响起
,忧伤未退尽
,一个温柔的否定
,一束光被遮起来
,那支舞谁再跳
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要笑的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着你回家
,告诉那个年轻人
,不要哭的太大声
,你的妈妈还等着
,回家。。。。。

,曾经那个买花的小姑娘
,已经长成了大人的模样
,她的脚步总是那样匆忙
,没有时间观赏这城市风光
,东门外 花儿正在垂败
,摆摊的老汉每天 只为那几十块
,谁不曾期待 有个好的未来
,就在这熙熙攘攘的

,听说隔壁老王他离婚了
,小张说她想换个男朋友
,我还是像从前一样歌唱
,只是去了一个陌生的地方
,这里没有我熟悉的街巷
,也没有人为我敞开怀抱
,每天迷失在现实与梦境
,怎样才能让我回到最初
,东门外 花儿正在垂败
,摆摊的老汉每天 只为那几十块
,谁不曾期待 有个好的未来
,就在这熙熙攘攘的 熙熙攘攘的

,时间飞走了 谁还会在原地徘徊
,青春已不在 人生不能再来
,就在这回不去的 那个时代

,不动情的咳嗽 至少看起来
,归途也还可爱
,琴弦少了姿态

,靠嬉笑来虚度 聚散得慷慨
,辗转却去不到 对的站台

,那贫瘠的未来
,像遗憾季节里 未结果的爱

,光影跳动着像在 困倦里说爱
,再无谓的感慨
,以为明白
,梦倒塌的地方 今已爬满青苔
,我想我应该是一朵死去的花
,不然怎么就盛开不了呢
,我想我应该是黑夜的孩子
,不然怎么就那么害怕阳光
,我渴望是一只孤独飞翔的蜻蜓
,在美丽的花丛中自由的穿行
,我多么希望自己是一只萤火虫
,在每一个夜晚都会有光明
,是不是所有的麻雀都会在冬天里死去
,是不是所有的人们都在金钱里丧失着良知
,是不是只有穷苦的孩子才能唱出最美的歌
,是不是只有漂泊的人们才懂得生活的苦涩

,坐在阁楼的床边
,望着窗外灰色瓦片
,慵懒的猫儿躲在
,睡倒在叶子里面
,也许它曾被抛弃
,也曾有快乐的模样
,孤单的转头看我
,我也没来得及闪躲
,总是在对望的时候才发现那就是我
,从我的眼睛看到它的眼睛看它的我
,我还不知道该怎么诉说
,所以写下这首歌
,愿你有流浪四方有家可归的生活
,别让挫败的生活让你变的脆弱
,尽管那是没意义的结果
,经历了之后再说
,…….
,是我让你难过了吗
,你转头不再看我
,望着身旁的高楼
,难道你也想有个归宿
,我想你在此时此刻
,什么都不想说
,别哭泣别失落
,相信你的身边还有我
,总是在对视的时候才发现那就是我
,从我的眼睛看到它的眼睛看它的我
,我还不知道该怎么诉说
,所以写下这首歌
,愿你有流浪四方有家可归快乐的生活
,别让挫败的生活让你变的的脆弱
,尽管那是没意义的结果

,用和平的方式交换
,彼此的防备
,可能是距离太远
,日夜寻觅回忆
,有种伤悲早有预备
,还是坚持复习她的存在感
,别说以后的事
,妄想来日方长
,因为岁月不能总回首
,跟你也不能共白头
,不愿提起过去
,不想谈论明天
,结束了一切以后还可以
,像初见时那样客气
,可能我不知道
,应该用哪种情绪
,以前我们总是以为
,有很多的以后
,时间却越过越少
,誓言在原地守候
,有种伤悲早有预备
,还是坚持复习她的存在感
,别说以后的事
,妄想来日方长
,因为岁月不能总回首
,跟你也不能共白头
,不愿提起过去
,不想谈论明天
,结束了一切以后还可以
,像初见时那样客气
,可能我不知道
,应该用哪种情绪
,因为岁月不能总回首

,每到夜里 习惯带上耳机
,按下PLAY～的播放键来感受作者心情
,在午夜享受宁静 那心中画面应景
,或许你也和我一样喜欢这种事情
,或许听到这首你只是在无意
,或许你会觉得某种场景太熟悉
,那种挥之不去的感觉扎在心底
,有话不能说 这就叫做秘密那么请你
,Play this song （Play this song）
,跟着走 (跟着走)
,洗完澡后躺下我不想动（不想动）
,U CAN CALL ME LAZY MAN 我是REAL LIFE
,伸手打开气氛灯 脱了衣服FUCK ALL NIGHT 哈
,Damn ！Shaty 曾告诉过你
,在419以后
,只管开心 dont love me
,but u say 难忘记
,OH my sun dont leave me
,现实摆着不能忘的记忆
,告诉你我可能患有夜游症
,你说反正我也看不见 我夜盲症
,哈哈 SO BABY
,就算抱着手机
,和你聊天都是
,那溢出来的蜜
,这感觉很奇怪
,它是我的最爱
,它流进脑海 永远放不开
,丢不下它存在
,慢慢住在心怀
,内容说个大概
,其他的你去猜
,放着缓慢的伴奏
,让思绪缓缓流过
,闭上双眼
,躺在沙发 让往事再回落
,去感受 慢慢的放松
,既然选择放假休息
,就关闭闹钟
,关闭了闹钟
,就放在 那书桌上
,打开了电脑
,就跟着 那伴奏唱
,搭乘时光列车
,然后 回头望
,多好的时光多好的一切
,学会 安于现状
,love and peace
,你总是挂在嘴边
,work and play
,重心该放在哪边
,思维却抢先
,抵达到那 希望的国度
,抓不住 开始
,日复一日不停的赶路
,who can tell me something true
,I admit that I lose
,没想过 音乐会渐渐 占据我的生活
,这样做或许可以解开
,他们的迷惑
,这感觉很奇怪
,它是我的最爱
,它流进脑海 永远放不开
,丢不下它存在
,慢慢住在心怀
,内容说个大概
,其他的你去猜
,我减慢车速 今天的心情
,是灰色或像夜色是黑的
,我摇上车窗 隔离了世界
,放空在小空间藏匿着
,不诚实的城市变幻从无预告
,视线中他出现在记忆的拐角
,霓虹街道的人流唯他黑白
,嘴中碎念没人能懂的对白
,落地橱窗的光 洒在他脸上
,捕捉他那瞬息万变的神态
,他解开了扣子 慌忙 擦去了汗
,也许这变幻 的都市他难以喘气
,他怀疑这城市也怀疑着自己
,擦肩又回 头会 下位 是谁
,这街上 的一切 像按了循环键
,耸了耸肩 他远离了视线
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方
,今天的心情是红色还是橙 色
,夜晚戴上全黑new era的款式
,出门右转的橱窗点亮了彻夜
,走过匆匆 人流只看到疲倦的侧面
,他解开一颗扣子看了看手表
,擦去了汗珠终于放松了手脚
,也许是约会的forever love
,也许是转折却不确定这love
,谁猜 测 他的开 心来自等待
,送给心爱的人 一杯仙草冻奶
,将要拥抱的感觉像是中彩
,灰白的都市 唯他拥有色彩
,他怀疑这城市坚持自己
,品尝那份执着尽管诱惑闪烁
,我咬着吸管刚才被冷落
,耸了耸肩他远离了视线
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方
,我走向街角 我驶向街角
,一辆车向我驶来 一人向我走来
,夜色已深无人的街道我试着打车
,夜色已深的街道有人朝我招手
,车门开了 我载你一程吧
,刚才街上有个人跟你很像
,难道我们不都匆忙成一样
,是的但是他总在嘀咕着什么
,或许是压力 或是甜蜜的烦恼
,是等待约会 或许在游荡
,他怀疑着城市坚持着自己（怀疑）
,他在都市的舞台上找到了自己（迷失)
,有人到达了 有人迷路了
,有人不敢去 有人不畏惧
,耸了耸肩 我们远离了视线
,对视一眼 哈 他就是我们自己
,U180 白天不亮 树
,我看见光芒背后 我看见城市之外
,我开始怀疑自己 我开始怀疑对方

,I can see the purple rain
,falling down on colorless me
,somewhere inside us is getting beautiful
,somewhere inside us is getting beautiful
,we're too easily lose touch with
,the better and softer ourselves
,somewhere inside us we were looking for
,somewhere inside us we called it flaming youth
,I could be your patience baby
,I could be your mountains baby
,I can never treat you like an invader
,when you broke into my world
,I can see the purple rain
,falling down on colorless me
,somewhere inside us is getting beautiful
,somewhere inside us is getting beautiful
,we too easily lose touch with
,the better and softer ourselves
,somewhere inside us that we were looking for
,somewhere inside us we called it flaming youth
,we were too close to
,we were too close to the quiet things yeah
,we were too close to
,we were too close to the meaningless
,we were too close to you
,I'm your purple rain
,I'm your colorless wind
,I'M your cruelest month
,I'm your flaming youth

,我们都有问题 都很难入睡
,我们都有问题 造成很多误会
,我们都有问题 围绕着是非
,我们都不知道怎麽处理我们的问题
,我们很像 都说我们没有问题
,也都坚持我们不一样
,隔着防备 却不知不觉被影响
,其实 我只想对你讲
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题
,我们知道自己弱点 但说得坚强
,一道道证明题 都解得牵强
,但为了阐述我的理想 激昂地演讲
,也为了攻破你 用力地回想
,我们那些很扯的过去
,成为彼此批判的字句
,用我的秩序镇压 是党的胜利
,战火烧过之後 剩下仿的正义
,不同的个体 不同的灵魂
,却总要对方了解自己 特别是情人
,我们的争吵 已是不红的新闻
,我们让嘴用来伤人 不重视亲吻
,针锋相对的刺蝟 潇洒的话是自卫
,我们的智慧 是没法为彼此交换位置
,一直只想对峙 忘了尊严和面子是两回事
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题
,是什麽一点一点累积 越来越不能忍耐
,一点一点消逝 一刻也不能等待
,越来越没默契 错误的翻译
,就连玩笑都被解释成责怪
,原本 能笑看对方超越自己底线
,渐渐 却像是睫毛掉进眼睛里面
,当冷漠不断扩张在爱恨之间
,最後 两个熟识的人就从此失联
,所以当我们已经对着不同角落放空
,我只想让我们关系善终
,让我们不受情绪搧动
,用理智收起一些放纵
,即使不能欢送彼此
,让我们想起初衷 不是比较 是微笑
,不是计较着 把什麽赔掉
,笑着接受 缘份是难以预料的
,不管被加入还是去掉了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过(SL:那些到底算是谁的错) 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,我们让彼此难过(SL:那些到底算是谁的错) 都别争了
,我们都很好 我们都不好
,那些伤害人的话(SL:那些只是气话其实我) 就别说了
,因为我们都有问题
,因为我们都有问题

,就像这样轻松一点 不要太复杂的文字
,这种感觉太美 所以早已模糊意识
,Yeah,ya know I'm chillin like Wiz

,Word up？把思绪全部关在门外
,真实的世界现在已经不再存在
,Dedicatin da song 2 u in da Chillin'Style

,墙上的规则只有一条 All Right
,这里的时钟刻度只有一点 All Night
,这里的Dress Code只有一条 All Type
,这里的营业时间只有一段 All Time
,V2:(Chack Zee)
,With my homeboy And1Time

,丢掉麻烦 踏上旅程的站台
,能为你做的我们全部都For free
,这样的生活不用去Roll weed
,关上我的手机 不被任何人打搅
,Homie 都知道我在哪 惬意往哪找
,Hey 为何不跟我一起
,你熟悉的Chack Zee 放一首Chillin beat

,无形的压力和现实依然对我产生了束缚
,抱怨过 但还是努力地加快了自己的脚步
,因为相信迟早有一天会写下所有的抱负
,流失的岁月 它就像昨夜做的一场梦
,如今的自己不再竹篮打水一场空
,不再幻想把所有的付出与实际行动
,也知道完成梦想其实它真的并不轻松
,渐渐看看自己 在这里一天天地长大
,也看着父母的头上长出了一根根的白发
,那瞬间 我不禁把头低下
,从那以后 我开始和他们认真地说话
,记不清从何时喜欢懒洋洋的冬天
,一个熟睡过后 我静静坐在床边忽然发现
,我遗落放在床脚的照片
,那一刻我明白回不去的是遗失的时间
,让我帮你升温 陪你过冬天

,如果有谁觉得时间走得慢
,可以把箭装进一颗蛋,拿一个碗
,本来射向人间的灯火阑珊
,却变成一束月光照在日上三竿
,还是觉得慢,慢得扩散
,连你怀里的蛋，都开始捣蛋
,给它一个搅拌
,让它迷乱禁止上街散发传单扰乱治安想推翻
,什么人呢
,他用哪一只手拿筷子
,他能不能够
,和我们一样
,享受
,一个月色撩人的早上
,在月色撩人的早上
,打开你的窗帘
,撕碎你自己的脸
,看见你的眼神空洞
,但充满月光的蓝色
,洒满在这城市里的每一个角落
,你骑着自行车
,贴着一片邮票
,在你的手的指梢轻轻巧巧
,你发现你的五官开始错乱
,好像是九大行星运转
,在这里没有任何东西可以抓得住
,好像是你的手指的指纹的命运一样无常
,你也许会马上结婚有马上离婚
,或者马上和另外一个人一起私奔到世界尽头的角落
,如果你觉得那地方非常黑暗
,像一个保险柜的里扳？
,你把密码都忘了
,自己出不去但是这个月亮还是能够穿透你
,你发现你的城市很冷
,有时沙子很多
,眼睛有时很淡
,世界有时很小
,语言有时很差
,这物价这糟糕的物价飞涨着你不知道
,有时不想上班有时也会迟到
,有时打着电脑有时候把自己的T-shrit一件一件撕了
,吐出那口烟雾之后发现
,拉开窗帘这是一个早上
,一个月色撩人的早上
,一个神清气爽的早上
,一个不在地球上的早上
,我和Jeff一起做音乐的早上
,月光洒下了，但是这是一个早上
,因为我们在宇宙中漂浮
,就为我们鼓掌

,二十一时分钟十九 这次更加持久
,记忆中十字路口 又一次那么真
,总在匆忙奔波碌碌之后划过一个圈
,刀锋轻拂时间 请你借请你请你借一点
,请再贴近一点 能否靠近灵魂
,能否拯救唱片店虽然已实亡名存
,无人漆 黑的彼岸 人类灯火通明
,他们自以为很聪明 妄图用火堆筑文明
,可火烧了你 点亮天空可消耗了你
,杀了孤傲诗人的手紧握的焦躁的笔
,最成功的麻醉 最 最贵的付费
,因为机会只剩一次 队 队形自动一致
,此时每个人都清楚 如何穿戴面具
,如何 尽早能进入角色状态 才能符合

,高了一个八度怎么抓得住
,stuck in a dream can only hear myself screaming
,stuck in a dream there's no one who can hear me
,stuck in a dream and wake up from another
,stuck in a dream now time's getting harder
,竭力呐喊呼叫 怎料 被隔音材料包裹
,的墙的房 躲藏正啜泣的男低音
,泪水流过脸颊淌过领带打湿他衣襟
,喉咙嘶吼至破试图挣脱到精疲力尽
,八瓶杰克丹尼 只为这次能靠更近
,上次快到了心 我憎恨天明
,我憎恨所有把我叫醒闹钟一类生物
,憎恶自心底深处 燃 控诉耳濡目 染
,岛最后一艘的船 桨是似桃木的板
,扬绝望的帆 能否赊我一个角落
,我和我的软弱只不过想喘口气
,而已 决堤绝无遗 痕迹 坠落悄无息 而你
,折磨我的穿梭着的穿过我的白色
,挣不脱的来者 手握体积配比三比一
,起 金黄色沐浴 举 杯畅饮剩余
,自颈流至地下 和梦一起融化
,stuck in a dream now time's getting harder
,stuck in a dream and wake up from another
,stuck in a dream there's no one who can hear me
,stuck in a dream can only hear myself screaming
,再也没有虚实 只有对于梦的记录
,歌者舞者诗人演绎对于梦的叙述
,我这么说给你听不是为了博得怜悯同情
,朦胧恍惚间的共鸣不止少数我想你也会
,不断 不断挣脱 布满 羁绊的锁
,真真假假错的对的 缠绕旋转 纠葛
,我梦见没有出口的商店 我梦见海浪跨过地平线
,我梦见坠入宇宙最边缘 我梦见混合血液的意大利面
,我梦见没有表情没有面孔一张张脸和我擦过肩
,我梦见光我梦见伤我梦见化尸骨水流往加工厂
,我梦见欲望浸满浴缸撑破家的窗
,我梦见我梦见我梦见做了梦中梦
,梦中的梦是梦中的梦永远记不清的痛
,无尽的痛围绕是怎么走也走不完的楼道
,或许梦醒时分只是短时间的求饶

,It doesen’t mean I don’t care
,Should I just call you to say
,I’m falling and I miss you
,oooh hoo
,Wish I was with you in my dreams
,and I'm praying to be your side
,and suddenly you'll slip away
,
,oooh hoo
,Easy as flowing down the stream
,Do you know that?
,Will you understand me?
,Why is it you make me wait so long?
,
,so long.....
,
,
,
,jazz的樂奏
,聽到這裏心裏感覺只有美好
,每天共對
,相對早的奔波晚的嘅被窩
,Wooo
,你早已滲入 我的所有
,Wooo
,如果你要離開
,在落寞深夜裏
,在寂靜早上
,在憨憨等待你
,在夢內發呆
,我飛 費盡我全部氣力地尋你
,誠心聽到你
,全因你美
,擘大眼起身我仍然覺得眼訓
,去刷牙洗面 仲帶著睡意幾分
,換件T 著上最熟悉對NIKE
,想話叮件多士（喂 你超曬時喇）
,七點三個字我動作要快啲
,趕唔到巴士 呢鋪又要打的
,追追趕趕嘅城市實在太逼
,節奏太快 我唔太合適
,一步一路經過未曾打掃嘅街道
,大清早 同大陽公公講聲早
,好似小鳥咁自由有邊個做得到
,一陣返到快餐鋪咪又係得個做
,我攞起IPOD聽著歌聽住JAZZ
,跟住城市節奏四圍忙四圍趯
,老豆日日話 人哋個仔比你叻
,我問我自己 你究竟搞緊咩呀
,在落寞深夜裏（我一個人 聽著歌）
,在寂靜早上（好在有你陪著我）
,在憨憨等待你（等待每日你嘅經過）
,在夢內發呆（帶住我 帶住我 帶住我）
,我飛 費盡我全部氣力地尋你
,誠心聽到你
,全因你美
,太陽落山伸個懶腰準備落班
,你問等陣間手工去邊度玩
,哎一早習慣每晚睇戲唱K食飯
,唔想去 更加唔想返去做宅男
,老豆打個電話叫我唔好咁夜返
,我話 老豆我好忙 人在江湖冇得揀
,其實仲未諗到去邊只喺一早已習慣
,大城市太空虛 夜太黑 人太累
,快回去 放下應酬壓力快睡
,係咁隊 太易醉 大大地 太情緒
,快回去 放下疲累聽朝再追
,搖搖欲墜已經冇曬力仲係咁去
,明明黑曬眼圈仲要撐起再飲醉
,天就光歸到家笪落床半睡里
,仿佛聽到耳邊有你聲音陪我睡
,在落寞深夜裏（我一個人 聽著歌）
,在寂靜早上（好在有你陪著我）
,在憨憨等待你（等待每日你嘅經過）
,在夢內發呆（帶住我 帶住我 帶住我）
,我飛 費盡我全部氣力地尋你
,誠心聽到你
,全因你美

这是一个开始 和一个新起点
时间滴答滴答我的热情并无削减
虽然钟表 它不停地回到原点
你三 百六十五天原地转了几圈
止步不前 坐井观天 不是我
冲刺抢点那生命线上的自我
加速过 才知道快感就是没输过
困难甚至变成动力加入我
假如说 遇见过客我会轻轻点个头
如果你 跟我一样早起那就握个手
他们消失在站台 你们在台下站着
行驶在赛 道需要你们一旁鼓舞
20几的岁 月还有几年可以挥 霍
霍霍不甘落后永远只做No.2
年轻的圆心 梦想的半径
那未来的无限只管 前进
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep on n on we gotta go
打开了邮箱收到几封私信
怎么讲把心里的话 献给我的至亲 
梦 至今 没有被雪浇得死心 
看到每天一起玩的都是知音 
有时候气力耗尽 你给我加一把力 
i feel so strong像是超级玛丽 
我秘方 goes on 不怕被谁吓唬 
我开始跑 你是否还在原地踏步 
人流之中我庆幸遇到知己 
这段征程没想过拿到大四喜 
我用我的真诚不停留 
每一步他们越喷 我越认真 
前方纵有太多的埋伏 请你跟上好吗 
如果 你一样 那还有谁在怕 
我们击掌 让他们追 只看到背影 
开拓这 穷乡僻壤 根本不靠背景
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep movin movin movin
Lets keep on n on we gotta go
时间在人生中 途他捣乱
物是人非 总是见怪不怪
年少时美妙的朋友有些不再相伴
they make me move on im still here 
感谢hater 口口相传我成佳话
魂斗罗两位大叔向前从没废话
如今他们年迈棒子到我手 另一手
牵着理想 为新的一天欢呼
想到过去的人和事两个字青涩 
过去的陪伴此刻又在和谁亲热 
不用去管夜晚关了灯闭上眼 
转了身又是新的清晨 
得了精神病整个人好精神 
湿过枕巾 曾经也画意诗情 
失禁的信心 背上包我了然确定 
这趟 我离梦想越接近
前进吧 我年轻呢
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
对梦的爱穿越世界的另一面
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
Lets keep movin on n on we gotta go
Keep movin on n on we gotta go
两西：
你会莫名的激动 莫名的哭
想要有扇方便的门随意进出
掺合着愤怒
牵绊着无助
焦虑和吩咐
方式很特别 我正在领悟
更小的细节 衔接着以前
发生的一切 
都是它对你的试验
什么事都会变
直到挣脱这锁链
和真实再相见
的你
看起来更矫健
每次接近都熟悉
感觉是 独一
和被忘记的呼吸
跟她说的对不起
当昨天被翻面了
始终都回不去
像无声音的默剧
循环中规律
你选择等待 
时间和未来
左胸口抚摸着爱
明天更加澎湃
最直接的状态
冲破阴影的障碍
后得到关怀
所有一切
只希望你能明白

,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,对我来说，地球就是一家便利店
,
,门外是再见，你默默抽着烟
,
,我知道你很恨我，而且不是第一次
,
,但我还是笑着发抖，准备给你讲个故事
,
,那是从我的爷爷的爷爷的爷爷就开始的冒险
,
,当女人吹灭蜡烛
,
,就要准备起飞
,
,你想想看，我和你的这座城市
,
,有多少人正在熟睡
,
,梦里说再见
,
,在这样沉醉的晚上
,
,我们疯狂亲吻对方，
,
,可即使是爱情也阻止不了我的幻想
,
,过去拥抱你的手臂
,
,现在用来远离
,
,使劲划着桨
,
,穿透大气层到没有重力的地方
,
,没有水也没有光
,
,没有涂抹防晒霜的心，直接面对太阳
,
,如果命运烧成灰，请你抓住我的彗尾
,
,比岩浆还烫，正好蒸发你的眼泪
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,把一句微小的格言刻在巨大角落
,
,我的母亲河不是黄河，是银河
,
,有一匹牧场上的马喜欢吃星星
,
,只有从太空吹来的风，才能吹动风铃
,
,这些年在地上收获了太多温存之后
,
,你持续的不安来自我的不安分
,
,但我毕竟是我爷爷的爷爷的爷爷的孙子的孙子的孙子
,
,在宇宙中诞生的蛋
,
,相比 律师、记者、作家、银行家
,
,歌手、水手、拳击手、大提琴手
,
,飞行员、保险推销员、注意安全
,
,安全？没有危险，哪来的安全，我险些死于大火
,
,一次次把自己写成情歌
,
,我喜欢打断生活
,
,也喜欢生活被打断的声音
,
,这让我更加渴望
,
,那未知的召唤
,
,哪怕前方无知己的孤独
,
,那是我的星宿
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次
,
,跑吧，兔子，跑吧，快跑吧
,
,拼命地挖吧，挖空了太阳
,
,你想活多久，你想飞多高
,
,都是你的奔跑，通往另一个森林
,
,呼吸，呼吸吧呼吸
,
,不要离开，你要离开我的担心
,
,你准备笑出的笑，你准备哭出的哭
,
,都是你的生命，通往另一个坟墓
,
,你拍一，我拍一，一个小孩坐飞机。
,
,你拍二，我拍二，划小船去天上玩
,
,你拍三，我拍三，去看看月亮的背面
,
,你拍四，我拍四，再见了爱人，再原谅我一次

,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,Like a movie that you can't predict
,Like a book that you can't resist
,I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
,bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
,verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
,with the whole city fast asleep, out cold
,true words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
,of a poet in me, most powerfully
,I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
,It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing,
,trying to find a reason to work, god willing
,I admit, my thinking is wishful
,like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
,how far do we have to stretch the truth
,to fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite
,throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
,on the analog player watch the people glow
,sit back to the breeze and let the memories flow
,comedy tragedy all the highs and lows
,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,Like your moves that I can't predict
,Like your look that I can't resist
,The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
,the lingering appeal was so unusual
,herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
,with the whole body fast asleep, out cold
,true vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
,of a prophet in me most visibly
,I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
,It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing,
,trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
,I admit, our dealing is painful
,like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
,how far do we have to stretch the picture
,before pixelating the human texture
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
,homecoming gathering with a big surprise
,throw on your favorite record that's good to go
,on the analog table and it's hooked to blow
,sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
,hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows
,It's funny how the music put times in perspective
,Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
,Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
,Wherever you are
,okay we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite
,throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
,on the analog trail and you look the role
,just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
,sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows
,we can take it all back to the register
,and start all over from the canister
,let's break it all down into pieces of bright
,moments that pass by like a meteorite

,虽然失败的苦痛已让我遍体鳞伤
,可我坚信光明就在远方

,当灰烬查封了凝霜的屋檐
,当车菊草化作深秋的露水
,我用固执的枯藤做成行囊
,走向了那布满荆棘的他乡

,可我相信未来会给我一双梦想的翅膀
,虽然挫折的创伤已让我寸步难行
,可我坚信光明就在远方
,-----music-----
,我用翅膀掀起那天边的排浪
,我用身躯托起那鲜红的太阳
,就在这刺骨而凛冽的大风中
,你会听到我在对未来的呼喊
,也许迷途的惆怅会折碎我的脚步
,可我相信未来会给我一双梦想的翅膀
,虽然失败的苦痛已让我遍体鳞伤
,可我坚信光明就在远方

,那看似满不在乎转过身的
,是风干泪眼后萧瑟的影子
,不明白的是为何人世间
,总不能溶解你的样子
,是否来迟了明日的渊源
,早谢了你的笑容我的心情
,不变的你
,伫立在茫茫的尘世中
,聪明的孩子
,提着易碎的灯笼
,潇洒的你

作词 : Bauhaus
Learning lines in the rain
Special effects by Loonatik and Drinks
The graveyard scene
The golden years
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Freeze frame screen kiss
Hot heads under silent wigs
Fall guys tumble on the cutting room floor
Look-a-likes fall on the cutting room door
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Learning lines in the rain
Special effects by Loonatik and Drinks
Freeze frame, screen kiss, hot heads, lights (headlights?) and power (powder?)
It's patently obvious
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Hot lines under a rain of drum
Cigarette props in action
Dialogue dub, now here's the rub
She's acting her reaction
She's in parties
It's in the can 

The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
Inspiring dreams, all shattered and blown away
Gathering dust, the band played on again
Personal reasons, are problems in the way
Waking up with just enough time to spare
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Searching out thoughts, we set ourselves a sight
Power and death are always on our minds
The cause is laid out, no looking back for me
The future holds the key for us to see
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

Life is short
Filled with stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough
I've learned all I know
By the age of nine
But I could better myself
If I could only find
Some new kind of kick
Something I ain't had
Some new kind of buzz
I wanna go hog mad
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' for
Something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' and lookin' to find
Some new kind of kick
Some new kind of kick
Gimme a kick
I want a kick
Like baby needs mom
Like Susie needs dick
This baby need
Some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' for
Something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' and lookin' to find
Life is short
Filled with stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I wa-wa-wa-want
Energy! Bar code! Drano hotshot! Wack attack! Helium! Nitrous oxide! Formaldehyde!
Some new kind of kick 

I dare you, to be real
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower in night fright
Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal
I dare you to speak of your despise
For bureaucracy, hypocracy- all liars
I dare
I dare
I dare- you- you
Persuadido por su madre
de que nunca sería un buen general,
aturdido por las bombas
que él decía esquivar.
Sin la medicación necesaria
decidió programar
un viaje a ninguna parte,
donde nadie lo pudiera encontrar.
Y a doscientos veinte kilómetros por hora,
tres días sin comer ni dormir,
le paró un coche de la Guardia Civil
y le pidió su documentación y él dijo ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.
Nominado para un Oscar
en la cumbre de su madurez,
venerado por la crítica
y por los jóvenes también.
A camino entre París y Tokio,
cada gesto suyo lo hacía sucumbir,
su mujer era su musa
y sus cinco hijos brillaban en torno a él.
Impoluto e inmaculado
fue a recibir su galardón,
pero antes de caerse desplomado al suelo
retorció su alma al grito de ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.
,
,Trepa por mi cuerpo y dame de comer
,Dime que estoy muerto
,Que no nos pueden ver
,Haz un ruido en mi alma, déjate vencer
,Ahora hay nieve en tus manos
,Y en tu voz ya no hay dolor
,Y aunque estés muy equivocada
,Y aunque tú ya no estés
,En mi cuerpo hay mil espejos donde yo
,Por donde yo te puedo ver
,Por donde yo te puedo ver
,Cuando nadie era nada
,Cuando el ruido era vital
,Cuando un beso era un juego
,Cuando el juego era matar
,Cuando era muy sencillo
,Y podías distinguir
,Cuando en tu cuerpo había nidos
,Que yo podía destruir
,Cuando intuías algo sucio
,Imposible de explicar
,Cuando tus ojos preguntaban estamos
,Donde queríamos estar
,Estamos
,Donde queríamos estar
,Estamos
,Donde queríamos estar
,Estamos

,Some people say that I'm a melancholy man
,When all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,The sun is blazing as I wander into town
,A long grey overcoat which trails along the ground
,And when I'm walking past the children in the park
,They stop their games, they shout my name
,And run behind my back
,If only they could see how happy I can be
,But sometimes they must look away
,Or so it seems to me
,I think I'll always be a melancholy man
,I know when all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,But if you have the time
,Please listen while you can
,Does anybody understand?
,I'll always be a melancholy man
,The sky is blue today
,Here in your nowhere land
,And how are you today, my melancholy man?
,You saw us looking through a window of a bus
,We smiled at you but you didn't smile at us
,And when you're old and grey
,Your days are at an end
,You'll wish that you had somone who
,You could call a friend
,Yet only I can see how happy you can be
,Oh sometimes they must look away
,Or so it seems to me
,I think I'll always be a melancholy man
,I know when all is said and done
,It's just the way I am
,But if you have the time
,Please listen while you can
,Does anybody understand?
,I'll always be a melancholy man
,When all is said and done, my melancholy man
,The sky is blue today, my melancholy man
,'And when no hope was left in sight
,On that starry starry night
,You took your life as lovers often do
,But I could have told you, Vincent
,This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you'
,As beautiful as you, my melancholy man
I believe you when you talk about the past
And I believe that you and I are friends at last
All the silence in this world won't change my mind
Talk about tomorrow or another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?
I believe you always wanted emptiness
And I remember I was full of happiness
All the money in this world won't change my mind
You can save your money for another time
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Tonight the earth and sky decide
Have you heard the good news everybody is a star?
Have you heard the good news everybody works so hard?

 I'm in love with the real world
 It's mutual or so it seems
 'cos only in the real world
 Do things happen like they do in my dreams
 Some of the rules may be different
 But maybe they'll stay the same
 In the real world
 In the real world
 In the real world
 We both win when we play the same game
 
 I'm in love with somebody
 I wish somebody loved me too
 You may wonder how this concerns you
 Well perhaps the somebody is you
 I don't even know what your name is
 But i just hope that you'll stay
 In the real world

  I just wish my life could be as strange as a conspiracy
 I hold out home but there's no way of being what I want to be
 The dragons blow fire angels fly spirits wither in the air
 I'm just me I can't deny I'm neither here, there nor anywhere
 Oh you should see my trail of disgrace
 (Oh oh you should see my trail of disgrace)
 It's enough to scare the whole human race

 I don't care about this life, they say there'll be another one
 Defeatist attitude I know will you be sorry when I've gone

作词 : Burgess, Fielding, Lever ...
I'm gazing at faces
Staring blankly at me
I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times
I lost my direction while dodging the flak
Oh give me a hint or something 
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
How long will they wait 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
Obnoxious actions
Obnoxious results
Teachers who refuse to be taught
Distorted pictures
And dizzy, dizzy people
Rush by me at the speed of thought
Sitting at tables
And throwing the scraps
For Christ's' sake leave them something
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
Will they hesitate 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
They're dragging me down
Eden
There's no Eden, anyway.
They're dragging me down
You either swim or you drown

,Und ganz egal wo du bist,
,Wie sehr du mich vermisst,
,Wie viel Zeit uns auch trennt,
,Und wie schnell sie auch rennt,
,Es ist gar nicht so schwer,
,Ich bin doch nur ein Herzschlag entfernt.
,Und du bist alles was bleibt,
,Auch wenn jeder Strick reisst,
,Unser Weg sich auch teilt,
,Ich will nur dass du weisst,
,Ich bin doch nie mehr,
,Als nur ein Herzschlag entfernt.

,Fing vor Stunden schon ohne dich an
,Unter dir deine Stadt
,Menschen hetzen die Straßen entlang
,Neben dir schiefe Türme
,Aus Glas und Papier
,Noch nicht mal geduscht
,Und es ist schon halb vier
,Wir sind Jäger der Zeit
,Und zum kämpfen bereit wir
,Rennen hinterher uns ist kein Weg zu weit
,Wir sind Jäger der Zeit wir

,Wir halten sie an dann wird's die Ewigkeit
,Wir sind Jäger der Zeit
,Jäger der Zeit
,In der Nacht selbes Spiel
,Deine Träume bringen dich um den Schlaf
,Dieser Druck ist zu viel
,Doch zum loslassen fehlt dir die Kraft
,Wenn der Tag neu erwacht
,Ist er auch schon verweht
,Wie schnell du auch lebst
,Du kommst immer zu spät

,Rennen hinterher uns ist kein Weg zu weit

,Finger fliegen über Tassen
,Wir rasten nicht mehr
,Sie wurde uns geraubt
,Haben wir sie vertrieben
,Geblieben ist nichts
,Nur Erinnerung und Staub.

,Auf Fürstengunst verzichte ich.
,Und auch auf die Puderlocken.
,Der Muff von Staub und Weihrauchduft genügt mir nicht mehr.
,Ich will das wahre Leben spür’n.
,Es hat dicke, rote Lippen,
,es riecht nach Wein
,und wärmt mich in der Nacht.
,Es flüstert, weint und lacht.
,Die Frage ist bloss:
,Wie wird man seinen Schatten los?
,Wie sagt man seinem Schicksal Nein?
,Wie kriecht man aus der eignen Haut?
,Wie kann man je ein andrer sein?
,Wenn soll man fragen,
,wenn man sich selber nicht versteht?
,Wie kann man frei sein,
,wenn man seinem eignen Schatten nie entgeht?
,Was soll mir die Unsterblichkeit!
,Vor dem Sterben will ich leben.
,Der Grabgeruch der Lorbeergruft betäubt mich nicht mehr.
,Was ist die schönste Sinfonie
,gegen einen weichen Busen?
,Kein Geigenklang
,kann je so zärtlich sein
,wie eine Hand im Haar.
,Die Frage ist bloss:
,Wolfgang & Chor:
,Wie wird man seinen Schatten los?
,Wie lässt man alles hinter sich?
,Wie jagt man sein Gewissen fort?
,Wie flieht man vor dem eignen Ich?
,Wie kann man flüchten,
,wenn man sich selbst im Wege steht?
,Wie kann man frei sein,
,wenn man seinen eignen Schatten nie entgeht?
,Wolfgang (Chor):
,Angst, die mir den Atem raubt（Neben dir steht ein Dämon）,
,Blei auf meinen Schultern（in Gestalt eines Knaben.）,
,Schweigen, das mir Fragen stellt（Ihm allein sollst du dienen.）,
,und keine Antwort gibt auf mein Warum（Was du bist, will er haben.Nur für ihn allein bist du gebor’n.）.
,Unsichtbare Blicke（Hinter die steht ein Dämon）,
,an denen ich ersticke（in Gestalt eines Knaben）.
,Der Schatten,der mir folgt – ich blaub’（Tag und Nacht ist er bei dir.）,
,eines Tages
,bringt er mich noch um.
,Wolfgang & Chor:
,Wie wird man seinen Schatten los?
,Wie sagt man seinem Schicksal Nein?
,Wie kriecht man aus der eignen Haut?
,Wie kann man je ein andrer sein?
,Wen soll man fragen,
,wenn man sich selber nicht versteht?
,Wie kann man frei sein,
,wenn man seinem eignen Schatten nie entgeht?
,Chor（Wolfgang）:
,Wie wird man seinen Schatten los?
,Wie lässt man alles hinter sich?（Wie kann ich leben,）
,Wie jagt man sein Gewissen fort?（solang ich nur dem Schicksal dien’?）
,Wie flieht man vor dem eignen Ich?（Kann ich denn nie,）
,Wie kann man flüchten,（kann ich denn nie,）
,wenn man sich selbst im Wege steht?
,Vor deinem Schicksal（nie, niemals）
,kannst du nicht fliehn!（vor meinem eignen Schatten fliehn?）

,我在那年秋天那个午后
,睡了一场四十分钟的觉
,梦见在陌生的海崖奔跳
,像一张未打完的初中草稿
,是关于一架锁进抽屉的纸飞机
,和一些埋进土里的玩具
,是一次虚情假意的作文命题
,和一些我丢了的记忆
,
,想要追逐的总是很飘渺
,能够把握的总是很渺小
,爱一个人是否自食毒药
,做一个梦抑或囫囵吞枣
,看见什么美好就都想要
,想到未来就逃之夭夭
,经历过多少,才能珍惜多少
,才不算遗憾
,才不算遗憾
,
,我在那场午觉结束的时候
,做了一个糟糕的决定
,买了一把中看不中用的琴
,为了一次传说中的旅行
,于是我成为恶心的人们的笑柄
,成为爱我的人的唏嘘
,也成为你眼里的光
,和我手心的泪滴
,

,信じてもいいって思えること
,それがキミだっていうことは
,まだ怖くて伝えきれないんだよ きっと
,
,凍えていたココロの片隅に
,光を見つけられたこと 確かめたいの
,
,キミの愛はどこですか?
,どんな愛がありますか?
,あいまいな愛の定義をちゃんと教えてよ
,キミの愛は何ですか?
,愛は何をくれますか?
,今すぐに 答えが欲しいから
,抱きしめて キスしてよ
,いつまででも
,ずっとね ずっとね ずっとね
,
,ざわめいている空と黒い海
,渦巻いて飲み込もうとしている闇は
,今でも奥の方でまだ待ってるけれども
,多分今なら抜け出せる
,そう思える キミとなら
,
,たとえ何が起きたとしても
,キミがいれば 何もいらない
,私には全てだから ちゃんと掴まえてて
,
,キミの愛が無いとダメ
,キミの愛を感じたい
,今すぐに 会いたいよ どうしても
,抱きしめて キスしてよ
,いつまででも
,ずっとね ずっとね ずっとね
,キミだけ 愛して いたいから

,As your heart explodes
,Into tiny pieces that don't matter
,I commit the crime around 10:15

,The sound of the screams
,And everything was white

,Everything felt right
,Now that the deed is done
,We can all go home

,Michael Jackson—Elizabeth, I love you
,Welcome to Hollywood
,That's what they told you
,A child star in Hollywood
,That's what they sold you
,Grace with beauty, charme and talent
,You would do what you were told
,But they robbed you of your childhood
,Took your youth and sold it for gold
,Elizabeth, I love you
,You're every star that shines in the world to me
,Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
,Elizabeth, I love you
,You're more than just a star to me
,Lovely Elizabeth
,You have surpassed them all
,My friend Elizabeth
,Learned to outlast them all
,Many started back when you did
,Lost their way and now they're gone
,But look at you, a true survivor
,Full of life and carrying on
,Elizabeth, I love you
,You're every star that shines in the world to me
,Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
,Elizabeth, I love you
,You're more than just a star
,This is your life
,You seem to have it all
,You reached your peak
,They wanted you to fall
,It's very sad, this world can be so bad
,But though all the heartaches
,When they put you down
,You know you were the victor
,And you earned the crown
,It's like walking through the fire
,Determinded to win
,You were beating life's battles
,Again and again
,Elizabeth, I love you
,You're every star that shines in the world to me
,Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
,Remember the time I was alone
,You stood by my side and said:
,"Let's be strong"
,You did all these tings
,That only a true friend can do
,Elizabeth, I love you
,The world knows your work now
,I pray one day I'll be just
,like... you

, 作曲 : Jackson, Jackson
,Always be not always and if always,
,bow our heads in shame.
,Always, please be not always.
,And if always,
,bow our heads in blame.
,'Cause time has made promises,
,just promises.
,Faces, did you see their faces?
,Did they touch you?
,Have you felt such pain?
,To have nothing,
,to dream something,
,then lose hoping.
,Is not life but lame?
,But time has made promises,
,just promises.
,Mothers cry,
,babies die helplessly in arms
,while rockets fly
,and research lies in progress to become.
,But what of men are flesh and blood?
,We turn our backs on life.
,How can we claim to stand for peace
,when the race is armed in strife,
,destroying life?
,Always, be not always.
,But if always,
,bow our heads in shame.
,Always, please, be not always.
,'Cause if always,
,bow our heads in blame.
,'Cause time has made promises,
,Death promises.

They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me
You got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ha! But there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure, so tell me
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Stop trippin'
We've got more problems
Than we'll ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walkin' into darkness
Tell me, what are we doing
To try to stop this?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
Oh, stop trippin', yeah, stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'
Why you wanna trip on me?
Why you wanna trip on me?
No, no, no, no, no don't you dare to me brother
Baby, oh
Why you wanna trip on me?
No no, no no, no don't you dare to me brother
Why you wanna trip on me?
No, no, no, no, can't you understand that
Why you wanna trip on me?
Don't you dare to me brother
Why you wanna trip on me?
You can't, you can't, you can't understand that
Why you wanna trip on me?
Can't you understand, baby
Why you wanna trip on me?
Ooh stop trippin', yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'

,Miael Jackson

,She speaks the lines that can control my mind
,Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
,She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
,Only for me, then spoke with her body
,Her only goal is just to take control
,And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

,Her actions confess and put me through the test
,I was surprised that I was caught inside
,Now she's thinking that I will never know

,Stop being without you
,But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
,And start being without you

,Together we could stand, united, hand in hand
,Like the stars in the sky just like them you and I
,We can stay forever, together

Once upon a time there was a tavern,
Where we used to raise a glass or two.
Remember how we laughed away the hours,
think of all the great things we would do.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.
Lalala lah lala, lalala lah lala
Just tonight I stood before the tavern,
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,
Was that lonely soldier really me.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.
Lalala lah lala, lalala lah lala
Through the door there came familiar laughter.
I saw your face and heard you call my name.
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser,
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.

,There lived a certain man in Russia, long ago
,He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
,Most people looked at him with terror and with fear

,He could preach the Bible like a preacher

,It was a shame, how he carried on
,He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
,But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
,In all affairs of state he was the man to please
,But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
,For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
,Though she'd heard the things he'd done
,She believed, he was a holy healer
,Who would heal her son
,repeat
,But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
,For power became known to more and more people
,The demands to do something about
,This outrageous man became louder and louder
,"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
,But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
,No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
,Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
,Then one night, some men of higher standing
,Set a trap, they're not to blame
,"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
,And he really came

,Lover of the Russian queen
,They put some poison into his wine

,When I'm looking in your eyes
,Everything seems to fade away
,After all these years we had do I know you now
,Have I trusted blindly in your love, too many times
,
,You said: "hey, my love, I'm sorry but we can't go on cause
,I'm in love with someone else"
,Tell me, what do you want me to say
,When you treat me this way
,
,Oh I love you, maybe

,Why can't I tell you no
,Time will show, the last word is for me
,If you fail to see the problem we have, one room full of walls
,Jar of love isn't dry until the last drop falls
,
,The moment I will step aside,
,you're ready for another ride
,Walking in the cool night air without underwear
,You have red light burning in your soul, I've seen the glow
,
,In every dream I have I say: "I'm not in love with you"
,But every day I say I do
,You have messed with my head so many times
,Forced me to love you (spoken)
,

,Title: Another One Bites The Dust
,(Deacon)
,Steve walks warily down the street,
,with the brim pulled way down low
,Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
,machine guns ready to go
,Are you ready, Are you ready for this
,Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,And another one gone, and another one gone
,Another one bites the dust
,Hey, I'm gonna get you too
,Another one bites the dust
,How do you think I'm going to get along,
,without you, when you're gone
,You took me for everything that I had,
,and kicked me out on my own
,Are you happy, are you satisfied
,How long can you stand the heat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Chorus
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
,And bring him to the ground
,You can beat him
,You can cheat him
,you can treat him bad and leave him
,When he's down
,But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
,I'm standing on my own two feet
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,repeating the sound of the beat
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Guess I got what I deserved
,
,Kept you waiting there too long, my love
,
,All that time without a word
,
,Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget or I'd regret
,
,The special love I had for you, my baby blue
,
,All the days became so long
,
,Did you really think, I'd do you wrong?
,
,Dixie, when I let you go
,
,Thought you'd realize that I would know
,
,I would show the special love I have for you, my baby blue
,
,What can I do, what can I say
,
,Except I want you by my side
,
,How can I show you, show me the way
,
,Don't you know the times I've tried?
,
,Guess that's all I have to say
,
,Except the feeling just grows stronger every day
,
,Just one thing before I go
,
,Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow
,
,The special love you have for me, my Dixie, dear.

,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
,She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
,She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
,Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
,She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
,She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as a shotgun
,Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
,Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,With my pretty little Galway Girl
,You're my pretty little Galway Girl
,You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
,And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
,As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
,After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
,I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
,Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
,Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
,And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,My pretty little Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,
,Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
,I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
,Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
,As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
,I walked her home then she took me inside
,Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
,I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
,About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

,Hello darkness my old friend
,I've come to talk with you again
,Because a vision softly creeping
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping
,And the vision that was planted in my brain
,Still remains.Within the sound of silence !
,In restless dreams I walk alone
,Narrow streets of cobble stone
,Neath the halo of a street lamp
,I turned my collar to the cold and damp
,When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light
,That split the night
,And touched the sound of silence
,And in the naked night I saw
,Ten thousand people maybe more
,People talking without speaking
,People hearing without listening
,People writing songs that voices never share
,And no one dare disturb the sound of silence.
,"Fool" said I "you do not know
,Silence like a cancer grows."
,Hear my words that I might teach you
,Take my arms that I might reach you
,But my words like silent rain-drops fell
,And echoed in the wells of silence
,And the people bow and prayed
,To the neon God they made
,And the sign flash out its warning
,In the words that it was forming
,And the sign said
,The words of the prophers are written the subway walls
,And tenement halls
,And whispered in the sounds of silence

,Frontier town, home of the westren hero
,Frontier justice, dealt with the iron hand
,
,He wore a long coat to the ground
,He wore big boots that made a sound
,He wore a six gun on his hip
,But now he doesn't carry it
,
,Sure enough, he was a western hero
,On the deck, sighting an old Jap zero
,
,And on the shores at Normandy
,He fought for you, he fought for me
,Across the land and on the sea
,But now he's just a memory
,
,And in the distance, the rocket's red glare
,The bombs burst in the air
,This time we're never going back
,
,Through the years he changed somehow
,He's different now
,He's different now

,Open fire, here comes the western hero
,Standing there, big money in his hand

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,What we＇ve done

The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin'
If you wanna hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark,
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
No don't mess with mister inbetween
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
No don't mess with mister inbetween

I told you 'bout living in the U.S. of A. 
Don't you know that I'm a gangster of love 
Let me tell you people that I found a new way 
And I'm tired of all this talk about love 
And the same old story with a new set of words 
About the good and the bad and the poor 
And the times keep on changin' 
So I'm keepin' on top 
Of every fat cat who walks through my door 
I'm a space cowboy 
Bet you weren't ready for that 
I'm a space cowboy 
I'm sure you know where it's at 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I was born on this rock 
And I've been travelin' through space 
Since the moment I first realized 
What all you fast talkin' cats would do if you could 
You know, I'm ready for the final surprise 
There ain't no way around it 
Ain't nothing to say 
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside 
All the prayers and surveyors 
Keep the whole place uptight 
While it keeps on gettin' darker outside 
I'm a space cowboy 
Bet you weren't ready for that 
I'm a space cowboy 
I'm sure you know where it's at 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I see the show downs, slow downs, lost and found, turn arounds 
The boys in the military shirts 
I keep my eyes on the prize, on the long fallen skies 
And I don't let my friends get hurt 
All you back room schemers, small trip dreamers 
Better find something new to say 
Cause you're the same old story 
It's the same old crime 
And you got some heavy dues to pay 
I'm a space cowboy 
Bet you weren't ready for that 
I'm a space cowboy 
I'm sure you know where it's at 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

,Your eyes are moist you scream and shout
,As though you were a man possessed
,From deep inside comes rushing forth
,All the anguish you suppressed
,Up on your wall hangs your degree
,Your parents craved so much for you
,And though you're trained to make your mark
,You still don't quite know what to do
,It's never too late to start all over again
,To love the people you caused the pain
,And help them learn your name
,Oh no not too late it's never too late
,To start all over again
,Well it's much too late to start again
,To try and find a little bliss
,So on your woman and your child
,You release your bitterness
,You drift apart some more each day
,You feel the guilt and loneliness
,And the God of your childhood you can't find
,To save you from your emptiness
,It's never too late to start all over again
,To love the people you caused the pain
,And help them learn your name
,Oh no not too late
,It's never too late to start all over again
,You say you've only got one life to live
,And when you're dead you're gone
,Your family comes to your grave
,And with tears in their eyes
,They tell you you did something wrong
,"You left us alone"
,Tell me who's to say after all is done
,And you're finally gone you won't be back again
,You can find a way to change today
,You don't have to wait 'til then
,It's never too late to start all over again
,It's never too late to start all over again
,It's never too late to start all over again
,It's never too late to start all over again
,It's never too late

,We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit

,Workin' on our night moves
,Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
,Workin' on our night moves
,And it was summertime
,And oh the wonder
,We felt the lightning
,And we waited on the thunder
,Waited on the thunder（
,I awoke last night to the sound of thunder
,How far off i sat and wondered
,Started humming a song from 1962
,Ain't it funny how the night moves
,When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
,Strange how the night moves

Dear Mister Fantasy play us a tune
Something to make us all happy
Do anything take us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy
You are the one who can make us all laugh
But doing that you break out in tears
Please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years

Everybody Plays The Fool
 演唱：Aaron Neville
 整理：李正江
 Ok, so your heart is broken
 You're sitting around mopin', cryin'
 You say you're even thinking about dying
 Well, before you do anything rash, baby
 listen to this
 Everybody plays the fool,sometime
 There's no exception to the rule
 listen baby
 It may be factual, it may be cruel
 I ain't lying
 Everybody plays the fool
 Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
 But there's no guarantee
 that the one you love
 is gonna love you
 Oh, loving eyes they cannot see
 a certain person could never be
 Love runs deeper than any ocean
 it clouds you're mind with emotion
 Everybody plays the fool, sometime
 There's no exception to the rule
 listen baby
 It may be factual, it may be cruel
 I ain't lying
 Everybody plays the fool
 How can you help it
 when the music starts to play
 And your ability to reason
 is swept away
 Oh, heaven on earth is all you see
 you're out of touch with reality
 And now you cry, but when you do,
 next time around someone cries for you
 Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
 Use your heart just like a tool
 listen baby
 They never tell you so in school
 I wanna say it again
 Everybody plays the fool
 Everybody plays the fool, sometime
 There's no exception to the rule
 listen baby
 It may be factual, it may be cruel
 I ain't lying
 Everybody plays the fool
 Every plays the fool, sometime
 There's no exception to the rule
 listen baby
 It may be factual, it may be cruel
 I wanna say it again
 Everybody plays the fool
 The End

  I'm a rolling thunder, poutin rain
 I'm comin' down like a hurricane
 My lightning's flashing across the sky 
 You're only young but you're gonna die
 
 I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
 Nobody's putting up a fight
 I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
 I'm gonna get ya, Satan get ya
 
 CHORUS:
 Hell's Bells
 Yeah, Hell's Bells
 You got me ringin' Hell's Bells
 My temperature's high, Hell's Bells 
 
 I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
 If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
 See my white light flashing as I split the night
 'Cause if Good's on the left,
 Then I'm stickin' to the right
 
 I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
 Nobody's puttin' up a fight
 I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
 I'm gonna get ya, Satan get you
 
 Hell's Bells
 Yeah, Hell's Bells
 You got me ringin' Hells Bells
 My temperature's high, Hell's Bells
 
 INSTUMENTAL (SOLO)
 
 CHORUS
 Hell's Bells, Satan's comin' to you
 Hell's Bells, he's ringing them now
 Hell's Bells, the temperature's high
 Hell's Bells, across the sky
 Hell's Bells, they're takin' you down
 Hell's Bells, they're draggin' you around
 Hell's Bells, gonna split the night
 Hell's Bells, there's no way to fight, yeah
 Ow, ow, ow, ow

Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

As long as, I hang on to the string
I'd be a silly so and so
If I should ever let it go

,You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
,And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose

,
,Mysteries flashing amber
,Go green when you answer

,I survived against the will of my twisted folk
,But in the deafness of my world the silence broke

,The mirror's image
,It tells me it's home time
,But I'm not finished
,Cause you're not by my side
,And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
,Carrying your shoes
,Decided that once again I was just dreaming
,Of bumping into you
,Now it's three in the morning
,And I'm trying to change your mind
,Left you multiple missed calls
,And to my message you reply
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,High
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,Somewhere darker
,Talking the same shite
,I need a partner
,Well, are you out tonight?
,Gets harder and harder to get you to listen
,More I get through the gears
,Incapable of making alright decisions
,And having bad ideas
,Now it's three in the morning
,And I'm trying to change your mind
,Left you multiple missed calls
,And to my message you reply
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,High
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,And I can't see you here wondering where am I
,Sorta feels like I'm running out of time
,I haven't found what I was hoping to find
,You said you gotta be up in the morning
,Gonna have an early night
,Then you started to bore me
,Baby, Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
,And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
,She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
,And when she needs to shelter from reality
,She takes a dip in my daydreams
,My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
,That little lady sitting on the passenger side
,It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
,The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
,As Arabella, oh
,As Arabella
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
,You can't be sure
,Arabella's got a '70s head
,But she's a modern lover
,It's an exploration she's made of outer space
,And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
,And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place
,(That's magic) in a cheetah print coat
,(Just a slip) underneath it I hope
,(Asking if) I can have one of those
,(Organic) cigarettes that she smokes
,(Rubs her lips) 'round a Mexican Coke
,(Makes you wish) that you were the bottle
,(Takes a sip) of your soul, and it sounds like
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
,You can't be sure
,Oh no, it’s not me
,I just forgot to tell you
,Didn’t mean, it seems obscene
,We just lost track along the way
,I’m coming to terms
,I’m starting to learn
,This ain’t all it’s cracked up to be
,’Cause I’m using you, you’re using me
,It’s never as easy as we believe
,’Cause this hurts, I can’t leave
,I understand, but can you
,I’m just scared, you’re lonely
,Everyone knows you’re better than me
,I’m coming to terms
,I’m starting to learn
,This ain’t all it’s cracked up to be
,’Cause I’m using you, you’re using me
,It’s never as easy as we believe
,Is this what you need?
,Am I what you need?

,I’m not the kind of fool who’s gonna sit and sing to you about stars, girl
,But last night I looked up into the dark half of the blue, and they’d gone backwards
,Something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
,Forcing them to get an early night
,I have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
,As the one I caught when I saw your
,
,Fingers dimming the lights
,Like you’re used to bein’ told that you’re trouble
,And I spent all night stuck on the puzzle
,Nobody I asked knew how we came to be the one to who you surrendered

,To be learned by heart
,by all children of men
,It's the hour of the morning
,on the day after the dawning
,When the sun they said would never set
,finally set again
,Was it Cromwell or Orwell
,who first led you to the stairwell
,Which leads only forever to kingdom come
,Rushed alone by guiding hands
,whispers of the promised land
,They wished you luck
,and handed you a gun

,Yes we thought that they were brothers
,Then they half-murdered each other
,Then they did a karaoke turn
,And murdered our best song
,
,Told the governor's wife
,About the last night of his life
,She turned away in tears
,Called you a liar
,Where are all the old dreams now?
,The batallion, once so proud
,Lost in some old song

,Why you can't raise your voice to say

,It makes it so hard not to cry
,And as we say our long goodbye
,I nearly do
,Light up light up

,And we'll run for our lives

,You get a shiver in the dark
,It's raining in the park but meantime
,South of the river you stop and you hold everything
,A band is blowing Dixie double four time
,You feel alright when you hear that music ring
,You step inside but you don't see too many faces
,Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
,Too much competition too many other places
,But not too many horns can make that sound
,Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town
,You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
,Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
,And an old guitar is all he can afford
,When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
,And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
,He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
,He can play honky tonk just like anything
,Saving it up for Friday night
,With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing
,And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
,Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
,They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
,It ain't what they call rock and roll
,And the Sultans played Creole
,And the man he steps right up to the microphone
,And says at last just as the time bell rings
,'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
,And he makes it fast with one more thing
,'We are the Sultans of Swing'
,
,There's gold in the city
,But never quite enough now to pay the rent
,You could've had it all
,But the pity is
,Everything you're gonna need is heaven sent
,Maybe the dream that we had is gone
,The people round here are like a setting sun
,They're picking you up when they're knocking you down
,But they can't stop me from loving you
,
,Do you want a butterfly
,The deals don't let it by
,You do the damage kid
,If love's what it's all about
,It's soul I can shock you now
,You do the damage kid
,
,Like a stone I was falling
,Would anybody come and get me out of here
,I waited in rain for the calling
,Would anybody come and get me out of here
,Maybe the dream that we had is gone

,They're picking you up when they're knocking you down

,The dream's don't fly it by
,You do the damage kid
,If love's what it's all about
,It's soul I can show you now

,Be my butterfly
,Please don't fly it by
,You do the damage kid

,Every time that I see ya,
,A lightening bolt fills the room,
,The underbelly of Paris,
,She sings her favorite tune,
,She'll drink you under the table,
,She'll show you a trick or two,
,But every time that I left her,
,I missed the things she would do.
,
,She was the one - for me,
,She opened my eyes - to see,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.
,
,It was a cold September,
,Before the Indian summer,
,That's the thing I remember,
,When she gave me her number,
,Went from station to station,
,On a train 'cross the nation
,And the rain of November,
,That's the time that we ended,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.
,
,Vodka with Coca Cola,
,Cocaine tucked in her shoes,
,Cigarettes over coffee,
,Her halo slipped to a noose,
,Take a slow boat to China,
,You fly a rag 'round the moon,
,She could take it or leave it,
,I knew it had to end soon.
,
,She was the one - for me,
,She opened my eyes - to see,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.

,Something’s crept in under our door
, Silent soaking through the floor
,
, Pinching like a stone in my shoe
, Some chemical is breaking down the glue
, That’s been binding me to you
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
,
,Well I thought that love watched over this house
, But you’re boarding up the windows now
,
, We’ve been leaning on each other so hard
, Tied so tight we wound up miles apart
, Making simple things so hard
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times

, The features I’ve been navigating by
, No nothing looks the way it did before
, I don’t know where to look or what to look for

Vivant seule, loin de tout,
 Dressée sur les toits du monde,
 Je garde toujours un oeil sur toi
 Lorsque la nuit enserre la ville,
 Que se meurent les espérances.
 Au détour d'une rue j'attrapperai ta main
 Pour te montrer les lumières bleutées
 Et poursuivre les ombre fuyantes.
 Au détour d'une rue j'attrapperai ta main
 Pour ne plus la lâcher
 Et qu'ensemble nous corrions
 Comme des fous dans les sombres allées.

You may be dumb but the passage of times can change anything like the feelings we find
So i'll disappear through the crack in the wall and the memories I leave will be nothing at all
It's kind of funny
Ooh ooooo ooh oooo oooh

So close to peace in the valley's so far i've lost all the fears that appeared in the dark
Oh we all are so weak, so frail it's unfair, through the crack on the wall it could be anywhere

Midnight, snakebite got me in
the back of my neck
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Yes - course you do
Bleached blonde hair and big blue eyes
Lives her life on the forty five
Likes you better dead
She's a killer - yes
She's a killer
Likes you better dead than alive
(Oh dear)
Some kids cry and some kids laugh
And if they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath - right!
Right!
When she comes round looking for you
Her gun's empty nothing you can do
Thirteen floors high
And the town still alive
Are you?
She's a killer
Likes you better dead than alive, oh.
Some kids cry and some kids laugh (ha ha)
If they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath - right!
I see the papers and letters have arrived
Anyway, I wasn't - I wasn't
anywhere last night
This is the truth
Someone knocking on the window
Someone's knocking on my door
I'm not normal - I'm not quite right, RIGHT!
Can hear bells ringing, must be Sunday
Can see the sun, must be Sunday
Can hear cars, must be Monday
Nothing doing!
When she comes round looking for you
Her gun's empty, there's nothing you can do.
Well I've lived on rice long enough
And I ain't you, no
The sun is shining - it must be Sunday
The bells are ringing for me and my girl
Some kids cry and some kids laugh (ha ha)
If they're really naughty
Give 'em an acid bath - right!
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride in my limousine?
Do you wanna take a ride young lady?
Wanna take a ride?
Do you wanna take a ride on the end of THIS?

,What is the rock and roll lifestyle?
,A leather jacket? Long hair?
,Waking up with mystery bruises and a nasty itch?
,Of course. But it's more than that
,It's laughing at the establishment
,Even if you don't know what the establishment is
,And that's what Lazlow is all about!
,I'm 100% rebel.
,I got kicked out of school after the 12th grade, man!
,That's why when V-Rock was looking for a DJ to open the portals of hell
,And play commercials in between the records they'd chosen, they picked me!
,V-Rock: Home of Lazlow and the Vulture
,I'll tell you one thing:
,It takes a lot of soul, compassion, commitment
,And artistic integrity to play other people's music for money!
,So listen to this: Don't sell out! I never will.
,Get a lighter, turn up the lights, and turn up the stereo!
,Because V-Rock and I have teamed up with the record companies to show you how to party
,I've hand-picked my favorite records that I play on my show
,These are records that I feel almost as passionate about as I do about myself

(lyrics - haneman, king, music - hanneman)
Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquisition
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone
Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away
Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now i shall reign in blood!

,The Dream Synopsis
,Well we were kissing it was secret
,We'd had to sneak beyond the kitchen
,Both well aware that there'd be trouble
,If the manager should find us
,You'd got a leaning tower of pint pots in your hand
,You can carry much more than I can
,And a wicked gale came howling up through
,Sheffield City Centre
,There was palm tree debris everywhere and a Roman Colosseum
,Isn't it boring when I talk about my dreams?
,I'm in a building and I notice
,That I'm surrounded by the ocean
,I get a feeling, I start running
,Don't really know why I am running
,I never really know why I am running
,‘til I get caught
,Want to wake up to my dream report?
,And the snow was falling thick and fast
,We were bombing down Los Feliz
,It was You and Me and Miles Kane
,And some kid I went to school with
,Isn't it ugly when I talk about my…?
,Visions of the past and possible future
,Shoot through my mind and I can't let go
,Inseparable opposing images
,When can you come back again?
,And a wicked gale came howling up through
,Sheffield City Centre
,There was palm tree debris everywhere and a Roman Colosseum
,Isn't it boring when I talk about my dreams
,It must be torture when I talk about my dreams

,今も　あの日のままだね
,ふいに呼び止めて
,笑いあえたら
,言葉さえもいらない
,このまま君だけを　奪い去りたい
,胸の奥でそう　叫んでいるようだ

,I am trying to survive
,Victim of my desire
,I keep on running
,I'm up all night
,Times , i never thought they hurt so bad
,In darkest hours
,Stand by your door
,Wishing all would be just like before
,Let me find my piece of heaven
,Let me find my way back home
,I want this love to last forever
,And back together,rise once again
,From the ashes to the sky
,Cuz i need it so bad
,Let me find my piece of heaven

,This is New York，
,Night falls on the city
,Finds me all alone
,Makes me wonder
,Should I just go on home
,And I walk up the stairs
,To see if you're sill there
,Would you mind if
,I found you alone
,Then a cold wind came callin'
,Strange how it knew it'd bother me
,See the night would fade
,But the pain's gonna stay
,Makes me wonder
,Have you ever made love to me
,I can't stop the rain,
,Here it comes again
,Lightnin' strikes across the sky
,Oh, I can't stop the rain
,Here it comes again
,Lightnin' only blinds my eyes
,Ain't it sad,
,when the only love I ever had
,Just slips away
,Right through my fingers
,Ain't it a shame
,When I think of your name
,The only memory I have is it
,I can't stop the rain,
,Here it comes again
,Lightnin' strikes across the sky
,Oh, I can't stop the rain,
,Here it comes again
,It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky
,I can't stop the rain
,Here it comes again
,Lightnin' strikes across the sky
,Oh, I can't stop the rain,
,Here it comes again
,'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes
,Oh, I can't stop the rain,

,One day, in the year of the fox came a time remembered well
,When the strong young man of the rising sun
,Heard the tolling of the great black bell
,One day in the year of the fox when the bell began to ring
,It meant the time had come for one to go
,To the temple of the king
,There in the middle of the circle he stands
,Searching, seeking
,With just one touch of his trembling hand
,The answer will be found
,Daylight waits while the old man sings
,"Heaven help me"
,And then like the rush of a thousand wings
,It shines upon the one and the day has just begun
,One day in the year of the fox came a time remembered well

,One day in the year of the fox when the bell began to sing
,It meant the time had come for the one to go
,To the temple of the king
,There in the middle of the people he stands
,Seeing, feeling
,With just a wave of the strong right hand, he's gone
,To the temple of the king
,Far from the circle, at the edge of the world
,He's hoping, wondering
,Thinking back from the stories he's heard
,Of what he's gonna see
,There, in the middle of a circle it lies
,Heaven help me
,Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
,The answer had been found
,Back with the people in the circle he stands
,Giving, feeling
,With just one touch of a strong right hand, they know
,Of the temple and the king
,
,Deep in the night, when I'm alone.
,My heart starts to burn, cause I feel for you.
,I've been away too long from my love.
,I leave it up to you to understand.
,I've got this feeling, deep in my mind.
,Come back and love me, just one more time.
,On the ground of an ocean, we buried our love far away.
,My heart's still bleeding, won't you come back and stay.
,But I can't understand, why there's salt in my eyes.
,And I can't understand, why your heart is in disguise.
,For I still need you, and I want you to come back again.
,You make me feel like never again.
,I can't find the answer from the look in your eyes.
,My heart's still crying. Don't tell me your love is a lie.
,You're still the one.Who can set me in a state of trance.
,Why don't we give us a second chance.
,But I can't understand, why you laugh, though you cry.
,And I can't understand, why I don't say goodbye.
,For I still need you, and I want you to come back again.
,You make me feel like never again.
,For I still need you, and I want you to come back again.
,You make me feel like never again.
,For I still need you, and I want you to come back again.
,You make me feel like never again.
,For I still need you, and I want you to come back again.
,You make me feel like never again.

,They say that no man is an island
,And good things come to those who wait
,But the things I hear are there
,Just to remind me
,Every dog will have his day
,The spirits they intoxicate me
,I watched them infiltrate my soul
,They try to say it's too late for me
,Tell my guns I'm coming home
,I swear I'm gonna live forever
,Tell my maker he can wait
,I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
,Heading back to Santa Fe��
,It's judgement day in Santa Fe
,Once I was promised absolution
,There's only one solution for my sins
,You gotta face your ghosts and know
,With no illusions
,That only one of you is going home again
,And I blame this world for making
,A good man evil
,It's this world that can drive a
,Good man mad
,And it's this world that turns a killer
,Into a hero
,Well I blame this world for making
,A good man bad
,Now I ain't getting into heaven
,If the devil has his way
,I swear I'm gonna live forever
,Heading back to Santa Fe
,Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
,It's judgement day in Santa Fe
,So I save a prayer
,For when I need it most
,To the Father, Son
,And the Holy Ghost
,And sign it from a sinner
,With no name
,When I meet my maker
,When I close the book
,On the hearts I broke
,And the lives I took
,Will he walk away
,'Cause my soul's
,Too late to save
,Now I ain't getting into heaven
,If the devil has his way

, Out to pasture, think it's safe to say,
, Time to open fire.
, And we don't need the ladies cryin' 'cause the story's sad.

I used to hold the biggest balls
Deep inside my castle walls,
Spend my nights with concubine-
Wasted, unchaste, drunk on blood red wine.
Being the king was pretty cool,
I'd have to say that ruling ruled
And I'd be in throne still
Had I not one day fallen ill.
I spit and I coughed,
My vision went soft
And my chest got tight.
My court, they surrounded me,
They gagged and bounded me
And threw me out into the night.
Out in the mud I sadly sighed,
The waiting crowd laid and died.
There came a noise boisterous
From down in the cloisters
And I heard them call the cry;
"Draw up the drawbridge, draw down the blinds!
Everyone inside is getting high tonight!
Waiting for the plague to move on,
No one's getting sober till the liquor's all gone!"
The bra in the candelabra,
The panties on the paintings,
The Monks have tapped their finest cask,
And the Nuns are into fainting. They sing,
"I hold my breath, you hit my chest."
You stumble from the arms of the one
What made you, didn't you?
Fumble to the palms of the one
What pays you, didn't you?

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
,Somebody that you used to know
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,you didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know

,You can hear the waves in underwater caves
,As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
,We need time, only time
,When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
,If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
,So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
,All the time, all the time
,Can you believe that the crew has gone
,and wouldn't let me sign on?
,All my islands have sunk in the deep,
,so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
,I feel as if I were home some nights
,when we count all the ship lights
,I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
,We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
,~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,Until the sun comes up
,And we're wrapped in light
,In life in love
,Put your open lips on mine
,And slowly let them shut
,For they're designed to be together oh

,She says, Please don't make me go back there again
,
,She said, I wish there was someway to make them stop it.
,So he drives down to that principles office
,And says, I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
,I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
,I'd live my whole damn life to see that little girl smile
,So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
,She wasn't brought up that way.
,
,Emily's home late again
,He sees that boy drive away
,Oh but something's different this time
,She doesn't have too much to say
,She said, He tried but there's just some things I won't do
,And through the tears she said, I couldn't do that to you
,
,And he said, I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
,Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out

,I'm so glad you made time to see me
,How's life? Tell me how's your family
,I haven't seen them in a while
,You've been good, busier than ever
,Small talk, work and the weather
,Your guard is up and I know why
,Because the last time you saw me
,is still burned in the back of your mind
,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
,Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December turn around and make it all right
,I go back to December all the time
,
,These days I haven't been sleepin
,Stayin up playing back myself leavin
,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
,Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
,I watched you laughin from the passenger side
,And realized I loved you in the fall
,And then the cold came the dark days
,when fear crept into my mind
,You gave me all your lovin all I gave you was goodbye
,
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time

,I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
,So good to me so right
,And how you held me in your arms that September night
,
,The first time you ever saw me cry
,Maybe this is wishful thinkin
,Probably mindless dreamin
,If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
,I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
,So if the chain is on your door I understand

,So this next clip is
,Uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback
,And what we like to do
,Is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we were doing
,When we were putting a song together
,Just in case one of us blurs out a cool melody and then we forget about it
,And we want to go back and then
,And replay the tapes so that we could remind ourselves of what exactly we were saying
,Um, so I've brought in this idea called "Blank Space"
,And this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time
,And they are shouting out these production ideas like...
,You know, the "Oh" in the beginning of a chorus
,And that ended up in this song
,So this is the very beginning stages of this song on the album called "Blank Space"
,
,Nice to meet you, where you been
,I could show you incredible things
,Diamonds, seasides...
,...
,Oh my god..

,I could offer a million answers, all false.
,The truth is that I'm a bad person,
,But that's going to change,
,I'm going to change.
,This is the last of this sort of thing.
,I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on,
,Going straight and choosing life.
,I'm looking forward to it already.

,Just couldn't take it all

,And as she held him close he used to search her face
,As though she knew the truth - lost inside Cambodia

,我终于失去了远方
,雨落下来像有些忧伤
,想和你一起鬼闹
