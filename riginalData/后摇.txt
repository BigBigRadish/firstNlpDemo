,Eu tot mai visez
,Cum in brate-mi adormi
,Si ne-atingem in somn
,Pe umarul tau sunt lacrimi de inger
,De ce nu esti aici
,Sami spui cu un sarut
,Ca ma iubesti prea mult
,Sa plangem impreuna
,De ce nu esti aici
,Cand cerul m-a uitat
,Si printre nori eu cad
,Tu sa ma prinzi de mana
,De ce nu esti aici

,La fiecare pas te simt
,In fiecare zi ma mint

,La fiecare ceas ma inec
,Cand nu, nu sunt langa tine

I can't imagine life, without you by my side
This is love babe, that I'm feelin'
And I'm hopin' that you're feelin' the same way
Things tend to slip my mind, like how you like to wine
And dine babe, with romantic lights,
You mean a lot to me in so many ways
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(Lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well tell me what you want, babe
Don't think twice of our love, I say these things because I love you
But it's hard to explain, and I'm hopin' that you're feelin' the same way
You know that all of my feelings are inside and burning,
I tend to forget,
How much I L-O-V-E you really mean.
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(lately) have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well, tell me what you want, babe
Try your hardest to deal, Yes I forgot but You know how I feel,
Things slip my mind babe, that's a fact,
Tell me you love me and I'll tell you back baby
(freestyle)
(Lately) have I told you I love you?
(lately) have I told you you still mean the world to me?
(lately) have I told you I love you?

,Cold rain fell down my face when I just looked around
,An old man walked to me
,Begged for some pence
,I found out all my pockets and gave him all the coins
,He was moved and he said to me
,"Son,I'll pay you a great great light."
,He directed me a way and pointed a broken neon light
,He said:"just go and press the button, and let it on"
,("To find what you want")
,I did what he told me
,Oh what a bright shine in the sky
,I just looked around looking for
,He was no there
,Now I awake from my dream and come close to the window
,I want to find the light and now I want the bright
,Time time flies, his face dims in my mind
,But I will always remember what a beautiful shine in the rainy night
,
,You can love, you can love, you can lose
,When it all looks the same
,You can love, you can love, you can lose
,When you're tired of playing
,Here I am, there you are
,I don't know where we're going
,Or where we have been
,I look back when I know
,It's not there where I left
,Have to find it again
,Or the feeling I had when it had me
,It was only with you
,Here it is, there it goes
,Was a force of its own just passing through
,You can love, you can love, you can lose
,When it all looks the same
,You can love, you can love, you can lose
,Even at your own game
,You can look, you can look, you can see
,What you wanted to see
,All your life you've been looking
,Whatever it is, you don't find it in me
,All your life you've been looking
,Whatever it is you don't find it in me
,All your life you've been looking
,Whatever it is you don't find it in me

,But why, some say, the moon
,Why choose this as our goal
,And they may well ask
,Why climb the highest mountain
,Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic
,Why does Rice play Texas
,We choose to go to the moon
,We choose to go to the moon
,We choose to go to the moon
,In this decade and do the other things
,Not because they are easy
,But because they are hard
,Because that goal will serve to organize
,And measure the best
,Of our energies and skills
,Because that challenge is one
,That we are willing to accept
,One we are unwilling to postpone
,And one which we intend to win

,This great evil
,Where's it come from?
,How'd it steal into the world?
,What seed, what root did it grow from?
,Who's doing this?
,Who's killing us
,Robbing us of life and light
,Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known?
,
,Does our ruin benefit the earth?
,Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?
,Is this darkness in you, too?
,Have you passed through this night?

,No one now can take you from your home

,All we are is sinking endlessly

,
,I read your note, and I know just what you want to hear.
,It hurts less over time, but I’m not getting stronger. I just leave pieces behind.
,I can only fall so many times before I’m broke, unrecognizable.
,Now all I’ve left to give is the piece that still remains, and you bring the pieces back.
,Love, it only reconstructs the pain.
,As time fails to elapse, I’m finding you were everything to me.
,Now my future and my past are ending tragically the same

,Nothing ever changes, man
,Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead
,And there'll be new people standing here
,Drinking beer, eating pizza
,Bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos
,And they won't even know we were ever here
,And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust
,And bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers
,Trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet
,And they'll all be full of shit
,It's all so fucking futile
,
,I don't need money, man
,I don't even need a future.
,
,Every night I lie awake
,I can feel you walk inside my brain
,Can't expect a change to take

,Sick and tired my love
,Drop back to my old lies
,The fire has gone wild

,Breaking stones my walls
,And I just fall
,You know me wilder
,You know my treasure and my likes
,You know my bloodstreams
,And you let me you let me live

,And you let me you let me live
,
,I never meant to say you were a thorn in either side,
,It was a side effect from the scars on the fourty-fives.
,And as the vital mistakes, it reminds me of what we have,
,Despite the things you do, you know I'm a fool for you.
,They say a legal kiss is not as good as a stolen one,
,We put our lives on show and yet we sing to a different song.
,And from the bassinet to the graveside we never walk,
,Of everything I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
,I never once understood your dealings,
,A group of friends who I'd give what for.
,And I could name every crack on our ceiling,
,A sight of thorns.
,Am I a frame in your bigger picture?
,A rope or rein for your stormy seas?
,If I could be just a train fare richer
,I'd change my needs
,I'd change my needs
,I'd change my needs
,I'd change my needs
,And in the half light a rush of violence is in the place,
,And if a look could kill you'd need a licence for your face.
,You say that love is blind and I'm the one who restored your sight.
,The girl who never knows,
,I'm the girl who never knows
,I never once understood your dealings,
,A group of friends who I'd give what for.

,I'd change my needs

,Where everything goes wrong
,If you can't tell if I’m lying

,And write a mediocre song
,About the shell of mediocrity
,And pretend there’s nothing wrong

,Until you ask me to be part of it
,And now you're showing me your wall
,I wouldn’t want you to want
,To be wanted by me
,I wouldn’t want you to worry
,You be drowned within my sea
,I only wanted to be wonderful
,And wonderful is true
,In truth I only really wanted
,To be wanted by you
,La la la la

,Close your eyes and roll a dice
,Under the board there''''s a compromise
,If after all we only live twice
,Which life is the wrong road to paradise
,Don''''t say a word
,Here comes the break of the day
,In while clouds of sand raised by the wind of the end of May
,Close your eyes and make a bet
,Faced to the glare of the sunset
,This is about as far as we get
,You haven''''t seen me disguised yet
,Don''''t say a word
,Here comes the break of the day
,In while clouds of sand raised by the wind of the end of May
,Close your eyes and make a wish
,Under the stone there''''s a stone-fish
,Hold your breath, then roll the dice
,It might be the wrong road to paradise
,Don''''t say a word
,Here comes the break of the day
,In while clouds of sand raised by the wind of the end

,Gotta change my answering machine
,Now that I'm alone
,Cause right now it says that we
,Can't come to the phone
,And I know it makes no sense
,Cause you walked out the door
,But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore(it's ridiculous)
,It's been months
,And for some reason I just(can't get over us)
,And I'm stronger than this(enough is enough)
,No more walking round
,With my head down
,I'm so over being blue
,Crying over you
,And I'm so sick of love songs
,So tired of tears
,So done with wishing you were still here
,Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
,So why can't I turn off the radio?
,Gotta fix that calendar I have
,That's marked July 15th
,Because since there's no more you
,There's no more anniversary
,I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
,And your memory
,And how every song reminds me
,Of what used to be
,That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
,So tired of tears
,So done with wishing you were still here
,Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
,So why can't I turn off the radio?(Leave me alone)
,Leave me alone(Stupid love songs)
,Don't make me think about her smile
,Or having my first child
,I'm letting go
,Turning off the radio
,Cause I'm so sick of love songs
,So tired of tears
,So done with wishing she was still here
,Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
,So why can't I turn off the radioSo done with wishing she was still here

,This is the place, this is the sound
,A dark cloud overhead the people on the ground
,You can hear it on the air and feel it in the breeze
,It's coming for us both before we try to leave
,You looked right to me
,With tender eyes and shakin knees
,This dyer sound is scarin me and you looked right to me
,I said if we could go back
,If we had time for that
,Oh would you change anything
,Well you said "this is my last breath
,And I'll leave with no regret
,This life is over but I had you 'til death"
,The suns burnin up, waves crashin down
,We've pushed out far out to sea, we're left out here to drown
,And we heard it all before, how we come to die
,But just before it ends the people start to fly but...
,That won't change a thing, cause everyone I know has wings
,We can fall asleep kick and scream
,But that won't change a thing
,I said if we could go back
,If we had time for that
,Oh would you change anything
,Well you said "this is my last breath
,And I'll leave with no regret
,This life is over but I had you
,Left alone I can't decide
,I feed my monster deep inside
,Well this hunger brought me here tonight
,Help me see straight out ????? your right
,Well I said if we could go back
,If we had time for that
,Oh would you change anything
,Well you said "this is my last breath
,And I'll leave with no regret
,This life is over but I had you 'til death"

,
,Right here coming to life
,No one to blame
,Right now up and about
,A minute of fame
,
,I've been staying alive
,So many days
,No fear, happy or wise
,All through the way
,
,But I thought there was something
,In life to live for
,
,But if you hear me fall
,If you hear me fall
,If you see me walk upon a bridge
,Then don't recall
,
,But if you hear me fall
,If you hear me fall
,If you see me walk upon a bridge
,You've seen it all
,
,Right here coming to life
,Nothing to blame
,I've been up and about under the rain
,But I thought there was something in life to live for
,Yes I thought you were something in life to live for
,
,But if you hear me fall
,If you hear me fall
,If you see me walk upon a bridge
,Then don't recall
,And if you hear me fall
,If you hear me fall
,If you see me walk upon a bridge
,You've seen it all
,So I think we’ve said all there is to be said
,All the words keep bouncing around in my head
,Oh I feel so numb
,Please just take me home
,Seems like all the talking it took us nowhere
,All I really want is the touch of your hand
,I won’t speak a sound
,If you take me home
,If you hold me close
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,If I start to scream from the top of my lungs
,It would make no difference I’d still be alone
,It would leave you numb
,The words would echo on
,Rockets can be flown all the way to the moon
,So much we can do yet we fail to get through
,To one another me and you
,A traffic jam of words
,Can’t move forward, can’t reverse
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,Silence it will save us
,Making room for our love
,Yes it will
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins

,I've seen my dear
,I know him
,He's been here
,Can't you feel his atmosphere
,Can't you tell
,Can't you see
,How I'm wearing his feel
,His wind blows through me
,I have written his name
,In the window of saints
,Can't you see his colours that I paint
,I've seen my dear
,Even if not every year
,Still he's the gate in here
,I have come back dreaming
,So you must lead me through the day
,I will touch you night time
,In the loveliest way
,I would feel the sunlight
,But I got burnt from everywhere
,Now you must make me a shadow
,I will shine for you in there
,I can't change
,I can't change
,I can't change
,My angel took her promise
,And left with the worst of lies
,I will not ever be your future
,If every one just dies
,I can't change
,I can't change
,I can't change
,
,I have come back dreaming
,So you must wake me in a while
,You will see me living
,You will get my morning smiles
,My angel made my difference
,Like no one will look in
,She left me here to love you
,Please love me if you can

,So tender are my thoughts of you
,Still warm after the glow
,The stones are too soft to throw

,Memory loves you
,
,The sadness has got new tears
,Now they're falling gently on the ground
,So invisible and clear
,
,Memory loves you

,It ended deep in my own cave

,我不知道为什么这样
,爱情不是我想像
,就是找不到往你的方向
,更别说怎么遗忘
,站在雨里泪水在眼底
,不知该往那里去
,心中千万遍不停呼唤你
,不停疯狂找寻你
,我是不是该安静的走开
,还是该勇敢留下来
,我也不知道那么多无奈
,可不可以都重来
,我是不是该安静的走开
,还是该在这里等待
,等你明白我给你的爱
,永远都不能走开

,我看见窗户外面光亮闪烁
,原来是两只萤火虫
,它们在黑暗中朝着对方发出温暖迷人的光芒
,总是幻想着给我所爱的人
,一个灿烂不变的爱情
,它会象太阳温暖着我也会温暖着心爱的那个他
,体会着爱在时光中的幻灭
,还要面对自己的羞愧
,重回昨日 可爱象伤害 让我转过身
,不过是抚进一个温暖怀抱而无所谓是谁
,让我忘记那些不美 无力把握的悲哀
,
,不过是抛弃那些幻想而无所谓什么
,让我忘记那所谓智慧 它为何骄傲的存在
,想象的爱情又近又遥远
,象我头上的一层光环
,光环的温暖是那么无边
,它会化解所有的纠缠
,无边的温暖又近又遥远
,它让人心跳跳得柔软
,柔软的力量是那样那样
,害得我眼里的泪光闪闪

,想幸福就不应该太聪明
,不可能教对方反省
,太厌倦在你要开口前

,如果不爱我不用陪我走
,情愿做你的好朋友
,情愿不让你觉得愧疚
,就不牵手也不放手
,没有做到对你不恨也不爱
,虚伪的扮演你的
,现任朋友也不赖
,这阴谋谁看得出来
,要寂寞到底才够痛快
,错就错在我习惯了太坦白
,也许要为你变得
,不像自己更可爱
,我就赖着不离开
,要你看清楚
,我到底有多坏
,何必在乎哪一个先说出口
,至少我撑到现在
,还能得到你问候
,想你那时候你在已足够
,何必对身份那么讲究
,把幸福当作飘忽氢气球
,不可能永远在你手
,我们都有权利去守候
,或向前走
,这感情多自由

,你对自己一向这么差
,带来了这么多恶果
,要你慢慢消化
,.
,时针追着分针日复一日
,绕了多少个圈
,我静静等着你的出现
,面对空的墙壁拿出画笔
,描绘思念
,回忆太重我被锁在房间
,一天一月一年春夏秋冬
,过了多少时间
,眼睁睁看着你走好远
,伸出双手想拉住你背影
,却错失指尖
,微微笑不让泪模糊我双眼
,我钉在这里数着嘀嗒嘀嗒
,听你在那头抽着烟不说话
,若我们之间走到分岔
,是否还有什么
,眷恋着不肯放下
,我反复练习你最爱的优雅
,去说服自己不必在意真假
,就让时钟转回遇见你的那个夏

, 我们来到德辅道的路口
, 在这里停下
, 左边的红砖建筑物是西港城
, 前面就是香港电子站
, 我们会坐电车
, 车费只要几块
, 要小心右边有车
,过了两个人行道
,我会等着你的电车来
,上车不用给钱
,下车再给钱
,在电车的前门上车
,然后走上右边的楼梯
,找个前排的位置
,外面那个 就是我
,他说：“留下吧 别坐这班车了”
,他声音有点绝望
, 我心都碎了
,我从包里拿出纸笔
,递给他
,他看了一眼
, 一脸黯然
,然后“唉”了一声
,很快就写下一个号码
,为什么会这么依恋这个才刚认识一个小时的人呢
,我对他一无所知
,为什么会发生这些事呢
,我好开心 好恨这感觉
,今晚八点半 我会在茶室同一个位置等你
,现在我要走了 bye-bye

,我想念你的身体和腐烂的味道
,我想你乖乖在我面前乖乖跪倒
,你最好 把衣服脱光让我刻个记号
,把我的心脏掏出来给一口吃掉
,我现在没有良心只想对你施爆
,我无法控制我自己但我不想吃药
,就让我安静的去世反正没人知道

,别管我让我溺死在大海里 Myself

,人早晚都会死而你又为什么活
,爱情还是信仰我到底该怎么做
,让我好好想想好好想想 在我倒下之前
,让尸体随波逐流带着没说的肺腑之言
,我开始学会把自己给封闭

Me and you should take a vacay
I got a plan now, we’re going out
Save your whining for another day

Here’s the thing I wanna talk about
Listen up you gotta hear me out
We get it done, we get it done my own way 
I just wanna say (Wait!)

Take your clothes off
Dance again
In the pillows
Run the dedo
It don’t matter
We can play
Sing "da-na-na"
It’s the summer
Got exotic
Catch the rays
Hey, sun is never going down
Oh, we have all day (Wait!)

Maybe you’re tanked completely
Really, I don't mean to sound cheesy
It’s way too easy
You can wear it up in a beanie
And somehow not look sleazy, it's weird

And this day’s amazing
Out here we can make it
Your mom, left the Beemer
I think we should take it, yeah

Hey now, (Yeah, yeah!) hey now

,Until you take me away

,Is it war if you fight it?
,Is it love when you don't?
,There is more when you let go.
,Of the fear that you can't.
,As we burn in the fire.
,Slowly learning to breathe.
,Just keep calm in the falling.
,Always looking for an underneath.
,Imagine it's a warning sign.
,I don't wanna lose more time.
,Darling, don't you close your eyes.
,Keep listening - are you listening?
,I'm sorry we don't have forever.
,Ooh... but come die with me.
,There's a knock in the silence.
,I see death at the door.
,But I know we'll be alright.
,The day the smoke starts rising.
,And all the bombs fall down.
,Don't wanna be the ones caught hiding.
,Wanna see the sky when it hits the ground.
,Imagine it's a warning sign.
,I don't wanna lose more time.
,Darling, don't you close your eyes.
,Keep listening - are you listening?
,I'm sorry we don't have forever.

,You have to let it shine
,I know it’s kinda hard to fall
,But you have to trust them all
,The beach is burning
,Even though it’s raining
,Your screams are killing
,And you don’t have a clue

,We will call this place our home,
,The dirt in which our roots may grow.
,Though the storms will push and pull,
,We will call this place our home.
,We’ll tell our stories on these walls.
,Every year, measure how tall.
,And just like a work of art,
,We’ll tell our stories on these walls.
,Let the years we’re here be kind, be kind.
,Let our hearts, like doors, open wide, open wide.
,Settle our bones like wood over time, over time.
,Give us bread, give us salt, give us wine.
,A little broken, a little new.
,We are the impact and the glue.
,Capable of more than we know,
,We call this fixer-upper home.
,With each year, our color fades.
,Slowly, our paint chips away.
,But we will find the strength
,And the nerve it takes
,To repaint and repaint and repaint every day.
,Let the years we’re here be kind, be kind.
,Let our hearts, like doors, open wide, open wide.
,Settle our bones like wood over time, over time.
,Give us bread, give us salt, give us wine.

,Smaller than dust on this map
,Lies the greatest thing we have:
,The dirt in which our roots may grow
,And the right to call it home.

,I loved you for a long, long time
,I know this love is real
,It don't matter how it all went wrong
,That don't change the way I feel
,And I can't believe that time's
,Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure for love
,I'm aching for you baby
,I can't pretend I'm not

,And I'll never get enough
,There ain't no cure

,There ain't no cure for love

,All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
,The holy books are open wide
,The doctors working day and night
,But they'll never ever find that cure for love
,There ain't no drink no drug
,There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love
,I see you in the subway
,And I see you on the bus
,I see you lying down with me
,I see you waking up
,I see your hand, I see your hair
,Your bracelets and your brush
,And I call to you, I call to you
,But I don't call soft enough
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure for love
,I walked into this empty church
,I had no place else to go
,When the sweetest voice I ever heard
,Whispered to my soul
,I don't need to be forgiven
,For loving you so much
,It's written in the scriptures
,It's written there in blood
,I even heard the angels declare it from above
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure
,There ain't no cure for love
,We heard first from you
,and then in the papers
,and the radio said 3pm
,when all of people
,crowded around at the stakes
,just yards from the lake
,
,But we heard you say
,that nobody know about
,the dangers and all the stages
,opened up an appalling line
,of people waiting in vain
,as it started to rain

,Sadly, all of our business
,Is the business of our dying here at home
,And you ought to understand that
,For the moment things sounds pretty good that way
,I know nothing of consensus
,But I'm pretty sure the message got from Palestine to Rome
,And your family doesn't live there
,Since the wall and your old spotted dog came down
,And sha la la la la you'll get it
,Sha la la la la forget it
,Sha la la la la forever more
,And sha la la la la you'll get it
,Sha la la la la forget it
,Sha la la la la forever more
,Can you feel me now?
,Can you feel me now?
,I am waiting for our parents
,To arrive about an hour from now
,And they say that security
,And the weather won't be decent anyhow
,I've been looking through these pages
,Of a diary that they made me keep in school
,And the words were really awful
,But this picture that I found of you was cool
,And sha la la la la you'll get it

,So I think we’ve said all there is to be said
,All the words keep bouncing around in my head
,Oh I feel so numb
,Please just take me home
,Seems like all the talking it took us nowhere
,All I really want is the touch of your hand
,I won’t speak a sound
,If you take me home
,If you hold me close
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,If I start to scream from the top of my lungs
,It would make no difference I’d still be alone
,It would leave you numb
,The words would echo on
,Rockets can be flown all the way to the moon
,So much we can do yet we fail to get through
,To one another me and you
,A traffic jam of words
,Can’t move forward, can’t reverse
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,You and me
,Skin to skin
,So it all begins
,Words have lost their meaning
,Silence is our haven
,I love you more
,Silence it will save us
,Making room for our love
,Yes it will
,You and me
,Skin to skin

,Built from the memory
,Of all the daydreams
,That I buried underneath
,Now find me a way to divide
,All of the noise on the other side
,We'll change where we live in the fall
,Soon it will feel like nothing is wrong
,And I could see who I should be
,Through a past that casts it shadow down over me
,In empty fields on summer nights
,I feel the flashing lights
,
,Teeth clenched in moonlight
,A limitation, want to ignite
,Reset my biology
,The imitation, the apology
,And I felt just like a child
,I'm taking it all from the other side

,The home that I know seems so far

,Sometimes I almost forget these weary bones.
,Watching children play in the park
,Under these old familiar trees.
,They help me feel the glow of my youth.
,So many years have fallen between that boy
,And this ghost I am to you.
,It's a bittersweet closing of the blinds,
,Where the sunlight cast upon the world
,dims on the inside.
,And all the pieces that once made up who you are
,Fade with the darkness of each love who dies before.
,Look at me.
,I'm a lifetime of memories.
,Looking back so far, so longingly
,At you my darling.
,You're so beautiful in this photograph.
,In every moment we ever saved.
,And you were beautiful when you said goodbye
,three years ago today.
,When you're young, you never believe the story ends.
,That you'll one day out-live your fairytales
,And lay to rest your dearest friends.
,Tomorrow was my crutch and it collapsed under the weight
,Of all the things I never said before it was too late.
,Summer is over and now I feel it in my bones.
,Alone in the dark.
,Alone in the cold.
,The sunlight is a candle
,Dieing down in the quiet sky.
,Goodnight dear world.
,Goodnight old trees.
,Goodnight, and goodbye.

,君色シグナル
,「冴えない彼女の育てかた」OP テーマ
,詞：春奈るな、增谷賢
,放課後二人で過ごした教室
,机の上夢中ではずむ君の声
,鈍感な君のその態度が
,いつも私を意地悪にさせるの
,ひとりぼっちだと思う時もある
,涙止められない日もある
,本当の私を見つめてほしいの
,きっと伝わると信じているよ
,君はいつだっていつだって変わらないから
,私が何回も何回もシグナルを送ってあげる
,夢見たあの丘目指して
,くじけそうな時も頑張れそうだよ
,君がいるから
,兩人歩くいつもの帰り道
,名前のない気持ちが芽生え始めてる
,だけど踏み出すための勇気は
,すごしだけまだ遠くにある
,何も持っていないなかった私に
,君がくれた心の鍵は
,胸の奥で眠っていたつぼみに
,春の日差しを届けてくれる
,君をいつだっていつだって想ってるから
,きっとねいつの日かいつの日か
,ちゃんとわかってほしい
,二人で描いた未来を
,もっと近い距離で見つめられるように
,夢見てるから
,あの日触れた君のシグナル
,始まりの扉が開くよ
,あのね...
,君はいつだっていつだって変わらないでね
,私に何回も何回もシグナル送ってほしい
,輝くあの虹のように
,涙のあとも軌跡に変えるよ
,君はいつだっていつだって変わらないから
,私が何回も何回もシグナルを送ってあげる
,夢見たあの丘目指して
,くじけそうな時も頑張れそうだよ
,君がいるから

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time
,In my dreams
,I feel your light
,I feel love is born again
,Fireflies
,In the moonlight
,Rising stars
,Remember
,The day
,I fell in love with you
,Darling won't you break
,My heart
,Take my hand now
,Stay close to me
,be my lover
,Won't you let me go
,close your eyes now
,And you will see
,There's a rainbow
,For you and me
,As I wake up
,I see your face
,I feel love is born again
,Cherry blossom
,Flying birds
,In the sky
,Can't you see
,The sun
,That is shining on the fields
,Is it shining in
,Your heart
,Take my hand now
,Stay close to me
,be my lover
,Won't you let me go
,Close your eyes now
,And you will see
,There's a rainbow
,For you and me
,And I dream of you
,Every night
,Cause's there only you
,In my mind
,Will you be
,A stranger or a friend in my life

, Grabbing the plate and I still don't debate
, with these pills and these demons I keep it within
, Look at the sky how its rotting in rust
, All of my homies are sawing up dust
, Lost and forgotten my eyes have been stuck
, and I'm already dead so I don't give a fuck
, I've been running fast ever silent to the sun
, hold it steady to this cash if they boy lift his tounge
, when he caught up to the gates tell the guards better run
, when he aimed up at the peek
, pressed the weight up on the gun
, boy you better speak cause your mouth little wave
, now I'm heavily involved with the void and the pain
, and the bird in your chest keeps fluttering away
, from the beauty in your head but it all feels the same
, Aye
, and the bird in your chest keeps fluttering away
, from the beauty in your head now it all feels the same
, Now the bird in your chest just..
, Aye
, Aye
, Silent hill up and it quick with the pain
, Girl I know you say you feeling the same
, deep in your temple I just fade away
, and my skin is too numb so dont call out my name
, I was built to break the promise I made
, in the fill I put the comments to shame
, Boys in his flesh and I aim at the neck
, I'm too ugly to love and I'm fucked in the head
, Lies come up so i just chip off the phone
, No one knows I did this shit on my own
, Problem is I just be starting inside my crib I'm the 4 fake kids
, I dont give on how he lives
, tell em I am with the shit
, tell mom im getting sick
, tell mobs is the kid with pin
, With the dream with the mark on my skin and the hole in my head
, Angels no wings they just lay me to rest
, Givin the trust but I'm trying my best
, and I delt with neglect, there's a hole in my vest
, There's a hole in my wrist cause I'm fucking depressed
, And I reached for the sky and I fell In a mess
, running from bulls while I dance in the light
, Mummies or demons their lines are in sight
, My attempts have been failed that I tried many times
, I'm the ghost in the shell I decide out of mind

,When you played all the cards right
,When you wanted to try try

,When you were in for the long ride
,When you opened my eyes eyes

,Around our, around our block
,Too many times to realize that

,I was so terrified
,When you came into my life
,I'd lose the light that made me
,Who I was
,You looked into my eyes
,Told me you'd never lie
,And locked my heart up
,Deep inside you
,You loved me for a while
,I had a place to hide away
,I hide away with you
,(gave me a reason to believe)
,But when your heart went black
,I tried to get it back
,By changing everything about me
,I do whatever you want
,Cause it's all you
,That's making me act
,Till I turn into the woman
,Everything you want baby
,I do whatever you want
,No it won't be ever enough
,No I'll never be the woman
,That is everything you want baby
,I need a miracle
,I need a miracle
,For I'm uncomparable
,To everything you want baby
,I started carefully
,Building the parts of me
,To make a version
,That you'd like better
,Knowing down deep inside
,If you were the man i liked at first
,You'd love what I'm worth
,I do whatever you want
,Cause it's all you
,That's making me act
,Till I turn into the woman
,Everything you want baby
,I do whatever you want
,No it won't be ever enough
,No I'll never be the woman
,That is everything you want
,I change everything about me
,But it's not enough
,I tried to put me back together
,But i'm broken up
,I only wanted you to love me
,But I'm not enough
,No I'm not enough
,No I'm not enough
,I change everything about me
,But it's not enough
,I tried to put me back together
,But i'm broken up
,I only wanted you to love me
,But I'm not enough
,No I'm not enough
,No I'm not enough
,I change everything about me
,But it's not enough
,(I need a miracle)
,I tried to put me back together
,But I'm broken up
,(I need a miracle)
,I only wanted you to love me
,But I'm uncomparable
,(To everything you want baby)

, I'm breathing, I'm feeling alone
, I know that you're leaving
, While we're still undone
, It's gone right before our faces
, Gone without a trace
, We had something special
, I don't need no space
,
, So come back now
, Won't you give me some hope, come on

,I wonder if you're hearing me
,When I'm talking close to you
,Do you even know what's hurting me?
,Cause I don't know what to do
,You be out with your friends
,Rolling in your Benz
,Looking for something on the side
,I'll be deep in my bed
,Holding my own hands
,Trying to work this out
,I only get to keep fractures of you
,I only get to see pieces of you
,I'm only with an old picture of you , of you
,Cause I don't know what to do
,Rolling in the sheets I got from you
,Holding back the feels I have with you
,Wasted from the old memories of you, of you
,But we don't know how we got here
,(Fractures of)
,I wonder if you still like me as much I like you
,Do you really want the best for me?
,Even if it's not with you
,Cause you went out with your friends
,Trying to pretend
,That I am silly, ride or die
,Wonder if you would hang, ride to the end
,If I did this to you
,I only get to keep fractures of you
,I only get to see pieces of you

,My name is Birdie
,But I barely know how to fly
,I am lost in a place
,I don't know how to describe
,
,It's like I live between two worlds
,There's nothing in the middle for me
,I keep trying to side with one
,But it's so hard to just try and be
,
,Nobody sees me the way that I want them to
,My inner perception changes
,And I can't seem to break through
,
,I can't seem to exist without
,Another validating who I am
,My face is jumbled
,Reflections crumble
,Until I feel a damn sham
,
,My name is Birdie
,And I'm trying to learn how to fly
,I am here in a place
,I don't know how to describe
,I've been so many things
,And too little of others
,I live between planes
,Exist between mother and father
,
,But there's Cole
,She's my rock
,Speaking Elemeno tones
,Without a clock
,
,I felt free with her
,Like I could be with her
,But our time was cut so short
,
,Now I wanna be with her
,Yeah, I wanna go see her
,I've got eyes on me though it'd be the last resort
,
,My name is Birdie
,I need to know myself before I fly
,I live in a place
,Other's wouldn't be able to describe
,
,But I know I'm not alone
,I know there's more than one place to call home
,Whether it's people
,Or a place it's all equal… to me
,When you don't have a home
,Or a place to call your own
,When you don't have a home
,Or a place to call your own
,
,My name is Birdie
,I'm barely learning to fly
,I live in a place

,I was checking this girl next door
,When her parents went out
,She phoned said, "Hey, boy, come on right around."
,So I knock at the door
,You was standing with a bottle of red wine
,Ready to pour
,Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
,So I went in
,Then we sat down start kissing
,Caressing
,Told me about Jacuzzi
,Sounded interesting
,So we jumped right in
,All calls diverted to answer phone
,Please leave a message after the tone
,You know me and her
,Her parents were kinda cool
,But they ran a fine line between me and you
,We were just doing things young people in love do
,Parents trying to find out what we were up to
,Saying why were you creeping around late last night?
,Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
,Now you're dressed in black
,When I left you were dressed in white
,Can you fill me in?
,Calls diverted to answer phone
,Red wine bottle half the contents gone
,When I returned Jacuzzi's turned on
,Can you fill me in?
,Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
,I'd say, "Hey, girl, come on right around."
,So she knocked at the door
,I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
,Jumped in my ride
,Checkin' in where nobody saw
,The club we went in
,We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
,Saw it was early morning
,Thought we'd better be leaving
,So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
,Told you to wear it cause you felt cold
,I mean me and her
,Didn't mean to break the rules
,I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
,We were just doing things young people in love do
,Parents trying to find out what we were up to
,Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
,Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
,Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
,Can you fill me in?
,Wearing a jacket who's property
,Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
,But you left all your money on the TV
,Can you fill me in?
,(Can you fill me in?)
,Saying why were you creeping around late last night?

,I think we can both see through
,I think we can both see through
,
,I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
,The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars
,Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
,Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
,Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
,Morn came and went -and came, and brought no day,
,And men forgot their passions in the dread
,Of this their desolation; and all hearts
,Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light;
,
,The world was void,
,The populous and the powerful was a lump,
,Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless -
,A lump of death -a chaos of hard clay.
,The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,
,And nothing stirred within their silent depths;
,Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
,And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropped
,They slept on the abyss without a surge -
,The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
,The moon, their mistress, had expired before;
,The winds were withered in the stagnant air,
,And the clouds perished! Darkness had no need
,Of aid from them -She was the Universe!
,
,A fearful hope was all the world contained;
,Forests were set on fire -but hour by hour
,They fell and faded -and the crackling trunks
,Extinguished with a crash -and all was black.
,
,
,Serious I thank you so much
,You just caring about me
,Not giving up on me all the same
,I really do love you
,Thank you so much
,I'm just afraid
,Do you really want see
,I know it's not easy
,I know our relationship is hard
,But I am so happy I have you

,Now this girl could have easily been
,just another girl in the black book
,But what I loved about her most is that
,she genuinely loved me for who I am
,I mean I gave her all my love
,But no matter how much I gave
,she never asked for more than I could give
,And I think that’s what made me
,wanna take another chance on love
,
,
,I hold such bated breath
,My hand a brimming trove
,I hold such spinning wheel
,That my years gape wide.
,And I say yes, as true as Troilus.
,The moon having all to do with it, we wait and speak of nothing. I stare at your wealth as a moth would at a light. Our lies squeak like bus breaks on a boring hill.
,As False as Cressida you take my hand.
,I look into your eyes as into a foreign vowel, gathering my last words around me like photographs in a flood.
,I hold such bated breath
,My hand a brimming trove
,I hold such spinning wheel
,That my years gape wide.
,I could take this to you later
,But I take this to you now
,I must act quickly, you see,
,Before my mind invents a cold.
,Their love ran a faultless course, their eye trained on the same source, their hearts pregnant like salmon with millions of tiny hopes.
,Troilus: girl-shy but brash-hearted, on the cusp of full living.
,Cressida: bright-eyed but wary, bouncing on caution's weakest knee.
,And when she left, gutting the house of its contents as she went, a cold emptiness replaced the full feeling, leaving him as hollow-bloated as the deflating bulb of the stomach that remembers the child, love nursing us all into need.
,Blanking on the deep well of their love to bring up water, he waited nine days for her return, his patience a novena of noble longing.
,And I say yes, as true as Troilus.
,In privacy of heart
,I shuffle vagary
,And trick and the millions
,Suck at my bowels like mice.
,Like a boy Troilus begged for her return, rumors of her dissension like the cruel whisper of the winter wind hissing through the porch teeth. Nine days of wondering how the clock could summon up enough vim to muscle through the minutes. And on the tenth day something died, swelling like a tumor on the April path, ten days of sitting still, only to hear his heart break those ten times over.
,On the tenth day something died
,Swelling like a tumor the April path.
,Ten days of sitting still
,My body buckling like the belly of an accordion.
,And I stay true, as true as Troilus, and as I wait for you my life grows cold in waiting. Your truth sedated in the sleep-hub and your silence at the helm of our wreckage, I sit alone in my confusion, dwarfed in not knowing why, my heart like a brass instrument that is spittle-heavy, wheezing out.
,In the small font of a footnote, I beg for the tight screw, the green light, the hungry flutter of white hands at the blackening keys, to hammer out my own truth, weave a sharp confession, my knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells.
,That to be pianist
,And hunger at the keys
,In dreams airlifted out
,From where I toss alone in scrimmage.
,In dreams airlifted out, in dreams airlifted out, in dreams airlifted out from where I toss alone in scrimmage...
,I catalogue the moments of our beginnings
,Remembering how my body shifted like an easy tide
,As you pinned me to you.
,In these days of endless complaint,
,I raise my hand to cover my eye,
,As you did to yours, only to second,
,An open eye for yours, a heart for yours,
,A promise for yours, only to hold
,In jest, in dreams, in supplications,
,In jest.

,I wanted so badly to be able to protect her.
,That was all I could think about,
,as I gazed absently out of the window.
,Og söng til hans
,Ljúfsára söngva
,Uns hann birtist
,Svanur svanur segðu mér
,Hvert siglir þú er sólin fer ?
,Svanur svanur segðu mér
,Hvert siglir þú er sólin fer?
,Hvar sem hann skildi sín
,En aldrei fékk hún svör
,Lífið hinum megin
,Ef þekkti betri heim
,Hún sat ein við vatnið
,Frelsið til að fylgja þér
,Og svanur svanur gefðu mér

, Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
, The kind you'd find on someone that could save
, If they don't put me away
, Well, it'll be a miracle
,
, Do you believe you're missing out?
, That everything good is happening somewhere else
, With nobody in your bed
, The night is hard to get through
,
, And I will die all alone
, And when I arrive I won't know anyone
,
, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
, So what did you do those three days you were dead?
, Because this problem is gonna last
, More than the weekend
,
, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
, But I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
, Do I get the gold chariot?
, Do I float through the ceiling?
,
, Or do I divide and fall apart
, Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
, This ship went down in sight of land
, And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?
,
, I know you're coming in the night like a thief
, But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
, I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
, But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up
, So do you think that we could work out a sign
, So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try
, I know you're coming for the people like me
, But we all got wood and nails
, And we turn out hate in factories
, We all got wood and nails
, And we turn out hate in factories
, We all got wood and nails
, And we sleep inside of this machine
,
,Tie me to the river
,Feeling love that's sacred
,Fill my lungs with water
,And here I go.
,Tie me to the river
,Feeling love that's sacred
,Fill my lungs with water
,And here I go.
,Water rush my body yes I'm full of it.
,I don't wanna feel unless I'm feeling this.
,Water rush my body yes I'm full of it.
,I don't wanna feel unless I'm feeling this.
,Here I go
,
,You know? And it used to scare me so much
,That I didn't know what was coming in my life.
,You know, like, like I would always think
,Uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move?
,But maybe there isn't any right move.
,You know? I mean, look at us.
,You know, we all dress the same
,We all talk the same
,We all fuck the same
,We all watch the same TV.
,Nobody's really different
,Even if they think they're different.
,
,"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"
,And see, that's what makes me freak.
,Because I can do anything I want
,As long as I don't care about the result
,Anything is possible
,It is night on planet earth
,And I'm alive
,And someday I'll be dead
,Someday I'll just be bones in a box
,But right now, I'm not
,And anything is possible
,
,Nothing ever changes, man
,Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead
,And there'll be new people standing here
,Drinking beer, eating pizza
,Bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos
,And they won't even know we were ever here
,And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust
,And bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers
,Trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet
,And they'll all be full of shit
,It's all so fucking futile
,
,I don't need money, man
,I don't even need a future.
,
,Hollow to the touch,
,Make mischief at your best
,I’d follow at the cuff,
,Fake belief and rest
,With frozen feet I’ll move
,The winter brings a new,

,Left Holland bruised

,I remember reason not to raise my hand

,Leave this place thus you call my name
,Shouldn’t look back…
,Into motion,look back
,If you were so kind that
,If piecing my skin in
,It’s hurting me
,And now I know what you want me,it’s you
,Now I know what you want me to say
,I’m living in,I think I’ll be okay
,Time to know if I can do this anymore
,Blood on my shirt,blames on the floor
,I stack in my heart,only think is of you
,Those in my mind,does he even love you?
,In time know,timing is everything but I want you
,In time let go,if I can just find the way to forget you
,I remember reason not to raise my hand
,Swash is burnt,is tears away
,Leave this place thus you call my name
,I shouldn’t look back…

,One day it will come to claim its pound of flesh
,When it's done,there won't be anything left
,Sickness of poacker's pride
,
,Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick
,Don't lose faith
,I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going
,Was that I loved what I did
,You've got to find what you love
,And that is true for work as it is for your lovers
,Your work's going to fill a large part of your life
,And the only way to be truly satisfied
,Is to do what you believe is great work
,And the only way to do great work
,Is to love what you do
,If you haven't found it yet
,Keep looking, and don't settle
,As with all matters of the heart
,You'll know when you find it
,And, like any great relationship
,It just gets better and better as the years roll on
,So keep looking, don't settle
,
,My third story was about death
,When I was 17
,I read a quote that went something like
,"if you live each day as if it was your last
,Someday you'll most certainly be right."
,It made an impression on me
,And since then, for the past 33 years
,I've looked in mirror every morning and asked myself
,If today were the last day of my life
,Would I want to do what I'm about to do today
,And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row
,I know I need to change something
,Remembering that I'll be dead soon
,Is the most important tool I've ever encountered
,To help me make the big choices in life
,Because almost everything
,All external expectations, all pride
,All fear of embarrassment of failure
,These things just fall away in the face of death
,Living only what is truly important
,Remembering that you're going to die
,Is the best way I know
,To avoid the trap of thinking
,You have something to lose
,
,No one wants to die
,Even people who want to go to Heaven
,Don't wan die to get there
,And yet, death is the destination we all share
,No one has ever escaped it
,And that is, as it should be
,Because death is every likely the single best invention of life
,It's life's change agent
,It clears out the old to make way for the new
,Right now, the new is you
,
,Your time is limited
,So don't waste it living in someone else's life
,Don't be trapped by dogma
,which is living with the results of other people's thinking
,Don't let the noise and others' opinions drown out your own inner voice
,And most important
,Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
,They somehow already know
,What you truly want to become
,Everything else is secondary
,
,I don't know how else to be with you right now
,I didn't really see it, before
,I made a terrible mistake
,I shouldn't have hurt you, I shouln't have broken up with you
,I love you, i understand if you don't feel the same way
,But trust me I'll never hurt you again, I swear
,And i don't know if you're being honest

,
,
,
,Why do you hate me so much?
,How can you tell the one person in the world that I love, that I care for so much.
,How could you tell him to stay away from me?
,Do you think the only thing I'll do to anyone is screw them up?
,Do you think I'm not worth  loving?

,But something kept me standing by that hospital bed
,I should have quit, but instead
,I took care of you
,You made me sleep and uneven
,And I didn't believe them
,When they told me that there was no saving you

,Well she calls me up when she’s broken,
,Says to leave my front door open,
,I come home to find her smoking,
,With her eyes all fragile and thin,
,She’s always been hopeless at hoping,
,Always coped badly with coping,
,And I never know when she’s joking,
,She never lets anyone in,
,I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
,And she’ll never tire of these games,
,Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
,I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
,And we’ll drink too much for a wednesday,
,She’ll ask me why none of her men stay,
,I tell her just what her friends say,
,It never goes down too well,
,And she’ll stay hear til late in the evening,
,But she’s always arriving or leaving,
,Never decides to believe in,
,The people who know her so well,
,I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
,And she’ll never tire of these games,
,Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
,I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
,She says if we’re single at 40,
,We’ll get married and move to the country,
,But I know she’ll never want me,
,Then its five fifteen in the morning,
,I reach for her whilst I’m yawning,
,She leaves me with no warning.
,I don't want to say goodbye
,Let the stars shine through.
,I don't want to say goodbye
,All I want to do is live with you.
,Just like the light of the morning
,After the darkness has gone
,The shadow of my love is falling
,On a place where the sun always shone.
,Don't you know that's where our hearts both belong?
,'Cause I don't want to say goodbye.
,Let the stars shine through.
,No' I don't want to say goodbye
,All I want to do is live with you.
,Together our two hearts are strong
,Don't you know know that's where our hearts both belong?
,'Cause I don't want to say goodbye
,Let the stars shine through.
,I don't want to say goodbye
,All I want to do is live with you

,Jumping up and down the floor,
,my head is an animal.
,And once there was an animal,
,it had a son that mowed the lawn.
,The son was an ok guy,
,They had a pet dragonfly
,The dragonfly it ran away
,but it came back with a story to say.
,Her dirty paws and furry coat,
,she ran down the forest slope.
,The forest of talking trees,
,they used to sing about the birds and the bees.
,The bees had declared a war,
,the sky wasn't big enough for them all.
,The birds, they got help from below,
,from Dirty Paws and the creatures of snow.
,And for a while things were cold,
,they were scared down in their holes.
,The forest that once was green
,was colored black by those killing machines.
,But she and her furry friends
,took down the queen bee and her men.
,And that's how the story goes,
,the story of the beast with those four dirty paws.
,So, I won't let go
,And leave and go

,I found it in you.
,Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
,She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone.
,How did that make you feel?
,It reminded me of my dog, Callie.
,She died when I was eight, and she crawled underneath the porch.
,To die?
,To be alone.
,Do you feel alone right now?
,The search for God is absurd?
,It is if everyone dies alone.
,Does that scare you?

,There are battles to be won and they rage within our hearts
,They crash in like waves as we try to keep our heads high
,They form us and break us and they surely leave their mark
,And its the decisions that we make that sometimes break a heart
,That's when people you know turn into someone you knew
,As we all strive for a better life promises made but it's basically lying
,And that's when we all have to recognize the obvious powers of honesty
,And how disillusioning a normal life can be but it makes us come to terms
,With who we really are and where we wanna be
,We all need words to live by and someone who can make us feel alive
,The stories our mothers told and the few things that we cannot hold
,We cannot hold our breath long enough to die
,I ran away from a city that died and ran away
,From a love run dry. And nothing has kept me there...
,My fate had been chosen
,I ran away from a city that died and ran away
, From a girl that cries. And nothing has kept me there.
,My fate had been chosen
,I wish i couldn't tell a lie
,A heart so pure like a babies cry
,Just one more look at my fathers eyes
,I fill my empty heart with you
,I don't need so much to stay alive
,Just a bed, a room, and someone to kiss goodnight
,These nights i cannot sleep i fill my heart with you
,I don't need so much to stay alive
,Just a bed, a room, and someone to kiss goodnight
,These nights i cannot sleep i fill my heart with you
,The stories our mothers told and the few things that we cannot hold
,we cannot hold our breath long enough to die
,we don't choose death it chooses us
,We don't look back, we take the ride
,I don't need so much to stay alive
,a bed, a room, and someone to kiss goodnight
,To kiss goodnight to kiss goodnight
,to kiss goodnight
,Erase these chapters from your past
,Sweet dreams die hard
,Wipe away these bitter tears from my face
,All our hopes die last
,Erase these chapters from your past
,Wipe away these bitter tears from my face

,So echo out the profit to the term
,To the side question

,From one ruin to another

,Nowhere nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no
,Tonight the war’s strange for sale
,To make the lovers shouted
,From one ruin to another
,Now free the tail to evade the war
,Nowhere the nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no other, no
,For the sake of her
,Don’t you like here
,You can beat your wars, beat your wars
,And beat mine
,The moment they’ll crawl back
,You can be your wars, beat your wars
,And beat mine

,I see two lovers kiss on the street
,by Studio 6
,And I remember the petrol-thick mist
,we settled our lips
,And I remember hearing your father laugh
,While we made love in the next room
,we made love in the next room
,And I remember one of those mornings
,I reached out to wake you
,but I learned that he'd taken you back.
,
,I look through the glass to housing blocks and energy fans
,I see slow familiar lovers
,I see them pull their curtains back
,And I remember pulling your curtains back
,then we made love to the old moon
,we made love to the old moon
,And I remember one of those mornings
,I reached out to wake you
,but I learned that he'd taken you back
,
,And I remember
,you wearing that pink August coat
,that my grandmother wore as my grandfather's love.
,You're a little more clear with this wine in my hand
,And it colours my tongue as if your lipstick has run
,
,And I remember hearing your father laugh
,While we made love in the next room
,we made love in the next room
,Sun sets, we wander through a foreign town
,Strangely, there's nobody else around
,See you open you twice and show me your tights
,On the swing set at the old playground
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in the rearview
,Sun sets, I want to hear your voice
,A love that nobody could destroy
,Took photographs like podwer cards
,Book covers that we both adored
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview
,This always happens to me this way
,Recurring visions of such sweet days
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview
,When you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview

,they say- it must have been surrender
,they cannot see how i could love a man like i love you
,I tell-them all that there is to remember
,and i don't recall anything but your tenderness true
,they say - everything comes to an end
,that even the strongest will bend
,given the chances of time
,they say - a love like ours will not last
,but i've seen the future in stars
,and i know it's ours to refine ——
,they say - you will show me your true colours
,the moment the sun sets behind the mountain we lean on
,but i know - angels are there just for lovers
,and gently they guard us each day
,they say - you're not the lover for me
,hoping for proof they don't see
,somehow awaiting your crime
,I fall - into your arms
,with my heart open as wide as the stars
,I know that your love is mine
,they say - love in the dark is surrender
,all i recall is the fire that burns in our eyes
,i know - we will be always together
,forever is only a drop in the ocean of sighs
,
,What a pity that it is
,The way to come back home
,I tried to make a point to sell the last of what I own
,Well I can feel your breeze
,Begin to choke my living soul
,But I promise that its worth it
,
,What a pity that it is to right you in the soul
,I tried to make the words become a kingdom to your soul
,No matter how I try its just a lyric nothing more
,And it cant be worth it
,
,What a pity that it is
,To know that your alone
,I tried to clean your place up
,and make it feel like you were home
,No matter how I tried,
,still the house won't send you now
,And I'm not really worth it
,No I'm never really worth it
,And its not really worth it
,
,I am me
,And you are you
,When we are together
,Go on living
,With or without each other
,But when we're down to it
,Together is better
,Hope too hard
,And we live in a bubble
,So hard it busts
,At the first sign of trouble
,So if she's gonna leave
,Then you'd better let her

,A river flow
,a breath of air, a summer’s breeze
,forever free
,You ran across the land
,The sun went down
,And darkness fell
,There’s nothing, no one in your way ,
,or here for you
,You love it, hate it all the same
,ironicly
,Wherever you will go
,Wherever you will hide
,You always will remember this
,whatever you will try
,Wherever you will hide
,You always will remember this
,endlessly
,One never knows the consequence
,Until it ends
,A shiver down your spine again
,A dead men’s end.
,Wherever you will go
,Wherever you will hide
,You always will remember this
,whatever you will try
,Wherever you will hide

,By the river’s edge
,The first time I’d ever felt at home
,I could feel the weight inside
,Bind me to the ledge
,Being someone else I’ve never known
,I said my name was John but she knew my name was Jim
,And you must be the man with no religion
,They say you’re cold as ice
,But I see kindness in your eyes
,But all your life there’s been something missing
,But I’ll lead you darling out of the wild
,Away from that cold and steam and hunger
,A storm’s been raging inside your clouds
,That I call your lightning and thunder
,For a long long time I’d been a wandering man
,But never in the way one tells
,You can’t kill the pain with an age old shame
,I can’t get in a word in with myself
,She said to be just like a man who is made from flesh and blood
,Well I can see the ghost that you have been
,Who walks into the fire
,And who wades across the flood
,The ghost is not the soul that makes the man
,But I’ll lead you darling out of the wild
,Away from that cross you’ve been under
,A storm’s been raging inside your clouds
,That I call your lightning and thunder
,Yeah I call your lightning and thunder

,But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
,Kristen, come right back
,I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
,When you light the candle
,And on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
,And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
,Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
,Think I like you best when you're just with me
,And no one else...
,Kristen, come right back
,I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
,When you light the candle
,And I'm kissing you lying in my room
,Holding you until you fall asleep
,And it's just as good as I knew it would be
,Stay with me I don't want you to leave...

,Can't you make a knot slip
,I'll ask your ghost if he can remember me
,Cause I am a creature of mixed up energies
,In times of restraint living in captivity
,And on the other side more mountains slide away from their fault lines
,And taper into new shorelines
,Sliding down the timeline
,pulling the nerves up through your spine
,Veering off to the side sometimes
,When you lose sight of that line
,Guided by the same light

,A gesture between two brilliant and privileged men
,Ensuring the continuation and proliferation of their holdings
,And a weapon owned collectively by those with holdings
,To ensure that those without
,Stay without
,The wink and the gun
,Look at her face, she is so young,
,yet you turn your back on her.
,Give them the gift we've turned to gray;
,after all we've had our day.
,There's still ice in our caps;
,There's still gas in our tanks; but when we fall we break legs.
,And I'd examine myself but we know trying is the
,first step towards failure
,
,All could never set me free
,I'm so tired I can't sleep
,All my feelings gravity's
,Spinning in the world over me

,It hurts less over time, but I’m not getting stronger. I just leave pieces behind.

,As the broken sleep,
,Death forgot to thank me when I set her free.
,Come empty and you won't need anything,
,Believe in your own blood until your heart stops beating,
,And then you too will be set free.
,Tear down your towers and build bridges,
,Your god is a fraud if you wrote the mission.
,And the devil will die when he has no witness,
,I 'm not broken, I am nothing.
,I'm the vessel, not the poison.
,And I didn't want to lose you, But sometimes I forget
,When my prayers feel like they're just cigarettes.
,They'll take the headache away, then turn to ash,
,But they bring me back to life every time I find a new light,
,But then they bring up my past,
,And I fall further and further, and further,
,Until I'm afraid to get back up because
,I don't want to fall again.
,And I never thought I would be the one to fall in love
,And I also never thought I'd be the one, the one to call it off.
,But if there's one thing I know about myself,
,It's that I don't know anything about myself.
,'Cause you were nothing than a choice I had to choose,
,A tool I had to use,
,My favorite drug and my favorite excuse.
,And my hands are not clean, maybe they never will be,
,But they can still carry you home when you're ready to sleep.
,And the only reason the devil's alive in you and me
,Is because we disrupted him when he tried to fall asleep.
,
,Reading the poets has been the dullest of things.
,Even reading the great novelists of the past, I said, "Tolstoy is supposed to be special?"
,I go to bed, I read War and Peace.
,I read it, I read it, I say, "Where is the specialist in War and Peace?"
,I really tried to understand.
,I mean, and then many of the great poets of the past, I've read their stuff.
,I've read it. All I get is a goddamn headache and boredom.
,I really feel sickness in the pit of my stomach,
,I say, "There's some trick going on here, this is not true, this is not real, it's not good."
,You see poetry itself contains as much energy as a Hollywood industry.
,As much energy as a stage play on Broadway.
,All it needs is practitioners who are alive to bring it alive.
,Poetry has always been said to be a private, hidden art.
,Not appreciated.
,The reason it's not appreciated is because it hasn't shown any guts, hasn't shown any dance, hasn't shown any moxie.
,Poetry is generally very dull, very pretensive.
,Uh, those who say the poet is very private and precious person, I don't agree with.
,Generally, he is just a dumb, fiddling asshole writing insecure lines that don't come through,
,Believing he's immortal, waiting for his immortality which never arrives.
,Because the poor fucker just can't write.
,Most poets, coets, whoets, carrots, can't even write a simple line.
,Like, "The dog walked down the street."
,Nothing should ever be done that should be done.
,It has to come out like a good hot beer shit.
,A good hot beer shit is glorious man.
,You get up, turn around, look at it and your proud.
,The fumes, the stink of the turd, you look, you say, "God, I did it. I'm good."

,But right now I can't, I cant say it's our youth's
,Well here is my theater
,And Imma act this play myself
,Harder it's hard and you're breaking my heart
,Cause you're saying you say that you can't
,Imma, cry the tears that I've kept secret
,I can't stand the reflection in my mirror
,And it's hard to learn from mistakes I know
,Cause you're gonna you're gonna repeat them
,So everything reminds me about you
,And right now I can't, no I can't face the truth
,Wanna be less like me more like you

,I don't wanna go outside anymore
,I should pick myself up I'm off the floor
,don't fucking say it
,don't ask me to come through
,you know I hate it
,everything that you do
,every night you look at me like I'm a mistake
,it's cool how much you suck
,every song that you make
,before the night ends I'll make you go away
,telling me you never cared
,I don't want you to stay
,Bridge, you know, I mean,
,what I always thought was
,that there was this one,
,one perfect person for everybody in the world,
,you know,
,and when you found that person,
,uh, the rest of the world just kind of magically faded away and...
,and you know,
,the two of you would just be inside this kind of protective bubble.
,But there is no bubble,
,or if there is,
,we have to make it.
,Laying in the back of the room
,Eyes closed fast
,Always ask
,What did I do
,You dont see
,That I don't need, you
,I'm walking on thorns
,And I coulda sworn
,I wouldn't be here for long
,You don't see

,For weeks you are the star of all my dreams
,I can't focus on my cup of tea
,Now you are nothing more than ‘she’
,Sitting in the passenger seat
,Crying while i walk the streets
,All i do was read and read
,Look what you fucking did to me
,Miss me with your friendly smirks
,Love mistaken by a flirt
,Sheep smell short black skirt
,To me you are just fucking dirt
,Trust you with my body and soul
,Heart to broken for you too cunt soul
,Emotions aren't allowed to control

,I just want to say...I wouldn't want you anyway
,I appreciate your honestly,but just don't bother anymore
,It's...it's fine
,I don't want to be your friend
,It sucks that i deport so much of myself into this,for this to be the result
,But i should've known that i was joint with this shallow superficial party girl
,I thought you were different,i thought you meant something...
,Don't...don't even fucking make eye contact with me and expect me to feel one ounce of them with it towards you
,You are fucking worthless for what you did
,You lost a friend
,I would never want someone like you in my life for long term
,So...it's best that you are gone
,I hope you'll experience the same pain i experienced
,I'm trying to hold on to someone that's shallow and has to faces you
,And one day you wake up and feel ashamed to leave your room
,Disappointed that you even woke up that morning
,Upset that what you see in the mirror is the person you have to be
,Disgust that you are still alive
,Because thats how u made me feel...
,I'll talk to you later
,If i'm lucky,never again,bye.

,I o I can't feel myself
,Like I'm sitting here watching myself drown
,While I, I'm screaming out
,one day you keep doing this to yourself
,Shadow danced across the surface
,Reminding me of chase of a better place
,I can see your smile
,I can see your face
,One day I become a greater sad of lay
,While I, I'm screaming out why do you keep doing this to yourself
,I'm willing to hush your whole struggles

,While you’re dreaming of me
,Suffocate in your sheets

,So where do I go from here
,You dug your own grave
,I can't believe I tried to stay
,Now there's nothing else to say

,It's 4AM and I'm alone again, and where have you been, (where have you been.)
,Gave it up again because you always win.
,Feel so insecure, the way we're leaving it.
,Break me down again to get you high.
,Bring me closer just to say goodbye.
,I think it's time,breathing and I, Call it truce.
,Meet me half way, neck tied tightly, by the noose.
,All of these memories hide, wait till I lay my head down and then they come alive.
,Wrestle myself through the night, wonder who's arms are holding you tight.
,Wanna be back in your bed watching sailor moon, playing PS2, all afternoon.
,Where I wanna be is true,
,all I wanna see is you, all I wanna be is you,
,And I, don't wanna die knowing that you'll be alive, knowing that you'll be alright,
,with some other guy.
,Maybe this ropes tied to tight.
,I think it's time, breathing and I, Call it truce.
,Meet me half way, neck tied tightly, by the noose.
,I think it's time, breathing and I,Call it truce.
,Meet me half way, neck tied tightly by the noose.
,Tie me to the river
,Feeling love that's sacred
,Fill my lungs with water
,And here I go.

,
,
,I've seen you change a lot you seen me grow up
,From when my flow sucked threw shows but no one showed up
,And so what you still had my back through the rain
,It's crazy when I think about the change insane and lately
,They show me love so when I spit I represent you
,The 2-0 through gowe 6'ing instrumentals
,Killing any beat in itself I'm speaking
,Myself so when the heat peeks I'm keeping it seeking for help
,You light my eyes up when the night falls
,So I slow down on I-5 to get a better picture
,You're so pretty
,I could leave but I would miss ya
,And to breathe in the sea is where the air is never crisper
,I've seen people leave but I'm a stand right here
,So if the spotlight shines
,You're gonna be right there
,But tell me if I had no rhythm or flow
,Would you still have a place in the city for gowe
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I had a passion to write the pen was glued to my hand
,When I was writing these poems they were forming a band
,Alone did I stand my dreams still intact all the times
,I was smacked for even mentioning rap
,Now my folks love it and they just came to a show
,They don't catch all of the words but they applaud for gowe
,And as a son, that brings a big smile to my face
,So When I'm done
,I'll leave the bright lights of the stage and recline
,Reminisce on the times like my first battle At the Nippon kan theatre
,I lost that one Or my first out of state gig
,And the crowd was small
,Or the time we didn't have a stage at terry hall
,But we still rocked it
,and it's for the love of the art
,And a rest in peace goes out to the dearly depart
,So I bump biggie smalls one of the best emcees
,While I zone out at my spot as I reflect on me
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me? Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I used to sit at this bench and just write rhymes
,So I could see the city lights and memorize the skylines
,So when I closed my eyes
,I would see without seeing you
,It was beautiful the nights were so colorful
,And now that I've grown up I return to the spot
,And take a seat on this bench you got me thinking a lot
,About the past and the present and Whether not I was destined
,Or is it really a question will I compromise in my message?
,Never, you also told me that my rhymes were too hard
,That it was a bit complex and so I took it to heart
,Now my parts are more friendly extending my hand
,Not as abstract as then so we can both understand
,See you relate to my words cause I experience you
,Not to mention we been close since the days of my youth
,So regardless of where I flew or might travel around
,Where there's gowe there'll also be Seattle my town
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?

,I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
,For you
,I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
,I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
,Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
,I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
,Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
,Your heart weighs a ton
,Girl watch me heavy lift
,How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
,I mess up but shit you mess up too
,The way you answer makes me question you
,I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
,You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
,Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
,Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
,You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
,But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
,I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you
,I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
,For you
,I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
,I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
,Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
,I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
,Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
,It was me and you in love for a quick summer
,Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
,Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
,Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
,Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
,Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
,Shit heaven knows that I was hell bent
,First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
,Guess I should've known then
,But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
,At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
,I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
,I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
,No matter what tho I stayed put
,Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
,Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
,I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love
,I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
,For you
,I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
,I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
,Cause ain't nobody taking my baby

, 作曲 : Hayes, Nowels
,Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
,I found your address and got your phone number too
,Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
,Been to secret places you think nobody knows
,If I had to live without you
,Nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I've been hanging 'round all the places you haunt
,Spying on your friends to find out what you want
,Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
,Follow you around driving home in your car
,Do I have to breathe without you?
,'Cause nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I know this must be wrong
,It can't go on
,This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
,And making me a mockery
,This must be wrong
,It can't go on
,So won't somebody free me from this misery?
,Bring my baby closer to me

Yo! Feel the flow - Que pasa? Paradoxx!
Gente adelante - You know it never stops.
(Rap)
The lyrics have flown - yo - now it's time to rock
get high to the rhythm - we never stop
Insane in the brain - to another dimension.
Put your hands in the air - hey, close attention.
Back on the mic - yo - check the flow
jump to the rhythm - jump - drop the tempo
drop the groove - now, drop the cuts.
Rewind the tape to select Paradoxx.

,I could offer a million answers, all false.
,The truth is that I'm a bad person,
,But that's going to change,
,I'm going to change.
,This is the last of this sort of thing.
,I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on,
,Going straight and choosing life.
,I'm looking forward to it already.
,I'm going to be just like you:

,The washing machine, the car,
,The compact disc and electrical tin opener,
,Good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance,
,Mortgage, starter home,

,Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
,When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
,Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

,Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
,Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
,Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.
,My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
,Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
,Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
,And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

,Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
,Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
,To try and apologize for my mistakes
,But I just want you to know
,I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand

,要我别离开你身旁 问我究竟要想去何方
,我把眼睛 紧紧闭上 指指大雁远去的方向
,想一个人歌唱 找一个地方去飞翔
,不知你会怎么想 泪水已经 不停往下淌
,不知你会怎么想 泪水已经 不停往下淌

,那里有等我的姑娘 有我儿时的梦想
,这次又走在老路上 已经不再东张西望
,我的好姑娘 我只想带你和我一起唱

,在飞扬着人命的日常民主悲剧里
,在立杆见影的人民币斗争热情里
,你已经自由得可以做个有着屠户背景的商人
,或者调皮地扮演起以牢骚为乐的主顾
,有趣的是大家都在共同期待又一次
,又一次主权失而复得的事件
,又一次人造英雄的光临
,而我们则会象某人期待欠薪
,某人期待上市一样
,去期待下一次伟大的摇滚乐
,这快活的摇滚这复杂的摇滚
,晕倒在台上自得其乐的摇滚
,也许它永远都只能自得其乐
,而这些这些可并不能解决问题
,这些永远都不能解决问题

,为何共那又来又往没情没趣无情份的竟比你都更频繁畅聚
,为何遇到别人问好为何和你没有需要花心机讲好说话一句
,为何若有无聊事干便宁愿上载到电脑早已忘掉怎跟你吹水
,为何难得尚能腾空坐在戏院主角自杀你共我竟过倦而进睡
,过去共你(怎么去比)哪理会你(赶得要死)
,也爱用整晚说杜琪峰专长揭露命途无常的道理
,讲破天地讲到自己
,不觉迎面太阳已经升起
,只怕无法再有这种情怀
,优美得共你同时在这世界
,丑恶在于赤子的胸怀
,难敌这纷扰世态为理想或求生在挨(该理解)
,没完没了各有需要把青春贱卖(怎逛街)
,渐行渐远每天很快淡出得更快(这宇宙太大)
,握手将要安排原谅我悲观过界
,但血啃在喉中不吐不快
,为何为了别烦着你别防碍你悠然睡去不忍太早太夜回你电
,为何大家为求梦想为求上进没有空档分担怎么跟压力挑战
,为何为了未来易过便勤力到忘掉共你兜半晚风不需太多钱
,为何大家渐明大体再没有胆不理夜半有没有紧要事仍见面
,过去共你(怎么去比)哪理会你(赶得要死)
,也爱用整晚畅论人家感情最后为何完结的道理
,讲破天地讲到自己
,不觉残酷太阳已经升起
,只怕无法再有这种情怀
,优美得共你同时在这世界
,丑恶在于赤子的胸怀
,难敌这纷扰世态为理想或求生在挨(该理解)

,渐行渐远每天很快淡出得更快(这宇宙太大)
,握手将要安排原谅我悲观过界
,但血啃在喉中不吐不快
,如何勤劳便有什么出路
,令你与我少了几里漫步
,没能力坐到老出世需要进步
,你我再好也难逃这个轨道
,该理解没完没了各有需要把青春贱卖(怎逛街)
,渐行渐远每天很快淡出得更快(这宇宙太大)
,握手将要安排原谅我悲观过界
,但血啃在喉中不吐不快
,任何密友任何伴侣和谐互斗投缘
,互信尊敬退缩生疏挂心忽近又远跟世态摇摆

,秋风吹开了妹妹的花裙在萧瑟地飘
,青鸟成群地在你的长腿上盘旋
,妹妹你可知道我胸口的热血汹涌
,像这山谷下的驴儿打滚
,妹妹啊把我这快乐的外衣披上吧
,那感觉如何
,
,我已经听见了你的歌唱
,
,秋灯映着我翠绿的面孔在叮当地跑
,青烟袅袅地在我的双腿间升腾
,妹妹你可知道母亲卖掉了父亲的勋章在昨天
,像你屁股上吊着的水壶底那么大
,妹妹啊把我这疯狂的外衣披上吧
,那感觉如何
,我已经听见了你的歌唱
,我已经听见了你在努力地歌唱
,这感觉如何
,我想我听见了你的笑
,我想我听见了你在努力地笑

,我从一场噩梦醒来
,感觉你模糊的影子在窗头
,抓也抓不住
,拿起一堆破碎的石头
,画出每个时期你的笑容
,只有黑白
,河流有时快有时慢
,生活有人恨有人爱
,墙上爬过一只蜘蛛
,在十一点十八分的寂静上午
,屋子南偏西
,我经常在这个时间
,经历意料之中的台风和雾霾
,霜降或端午
,然后你笑了就飞了
,然后你醒了就老了

,因此花一天感觉一切是爱
,茫茫人海
,或有几多漂泊与淹盖
,人人寻找爱

Jazmine Sullivan - My Foolish Heart

My foolish heart it made me fall in love with him.
I know it goes with how it’s feeling.
My foolish heart was broken when he left us in the cold.
Now I’m left to fix the pieces.

I told you once I told you twice,
the next time I won’t be so nice.
You so quick to give it up,
when you don’t think about us. (you don’t think about us)
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
if you gone keep causing me pain.
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
I’m ‘bout to take you out the game.

My foolish heart will jump into the deepest of the seas,
Even if it cannot swim.
My foolish heart will trust just anyone, it’s so na?ve.
And I’m left to save it again.

I told you once I told you twice,
the next time I won’t be so nice.
You so quick to give it up,
when you don’t think about us. (you don’t think about us)
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
if you gone keep causing me pain.
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
I’m ‘bout to take you out the game.

I can’t take another broken heart.
Maybe we should spend time apart.
Driving me crazy, I can’t take it no more.
Maybe we should spend time apart.

I told you once I told you twice,
the next time I won’t be so nice.
You so quick to give it up,
when you don’t think about us. (you don’t think about us)
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
if you gone keep causing me pain.
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,
I’m ‘bout to take you out the game.
I told you once I told you twice,
the next time I won’t be so nice.
You so quick to give it up,
when you don’t think about us. (you don’t think about us)
I won’t let you keep (keep) hurting me,

,I threw a wish in the well
,Don’t ask me I’ll never tell

,내 머릿속을 어지럽히고
,내 마음속을 흔들어놓고
,왜 자꾸 넌 다른 곳만 바라보니
,눈앞에 너를 보고 있는데
,그토록 원한 네가 있는데
,왜 자꾸 넌 아득하기만 한 거니
,네 미소 하나에 맘을 놓고
,네 눈물 하나에 맘을 다쳐
,네가 사는 내 마음은 늘 그래
,서툰 미소 뒤 한숨들만큼
,몰래 버린 내 눈물들만큼
,내 맘 곁으로 와줄 수 없니
,My one and only you
,더딘 내 맘 언젠가 네가 볼 수 있다면
,꿈결처럼 기적처럼
,너를 꿈꾸던 그 시간에 있어주기를
,I believe
,알고 있니 두 눈이 널 훔쳐
,내 모든 걸 채워버렸을 때
,세상은 모두 달라져 있었단 걸
,멈출 수 없는 나의 가슴이
,시키는 대로 걸어왔을 땐
,이미 넌 내게 전부가 됐어
,네 미소 하나에 맘을 놓고
,네 눈물 하나에 맘을 다쳐
,네가 사는 내 마음은 늘 그래
,서툰 미소 뒤 한숨들만큼
,몰래 버린 내 눈물들만큼
,내 맘 곁으로 와줄 수 없니
,My one and only you
,더딘 내 맘 언젠가 네가 볼 수 있다면
,꿈결처럼 기적처럼
,너를 꿈꾸던 그 시간에 있어주기를
,My one and only you
,남겨둔 너와의 추억 그 문을 닫진 마
,결국 우리 끝내 우리
,서로의 간절한 하나의 소원이 되길
,I believe
,
,Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
,I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
,I fell right through the cracks
,and now I'm trying to get back
,Before the cool done run out
,I'll be giving it my bestest
,Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
,I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some
,But I won't hesitate no more, no more
,It cannot wait I'm yours
,Well open up your mind and see like me
,Open up your plans and damn you're free
,Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
,Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
,We're just one big family
,It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love
,So I won't hesitate no more no more
,It cannot wait I'm sure
,There's no need to complicate
,Our time is short
,This is our fate I'm yours
,do do do do you but do you do do do
,But do you want to come on
,Scooch on over closer dear
,And i will nibble your ear
,I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
,And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
,but My breath fogged up the glass
,And so I drew a new face and laughed
,I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
,To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
,It's what we aim to do
,Our name is our virtue
,But I won't hesitate no more no more
,It cannot wait I'm yours
,Open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
,Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
,Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours (It cannot wait, I'm sure)
,So please don't, please don't please don't (There's no need to complicate)
,There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
,Coz our time is short (This is our fate)
,This is this is this is our fate
,I'm yours

,you'll never see the sky.
,Walls stop the bitter winds from cutting through the cracks,
,and I need to know there's a light,
,and a life still left to live,
,and I know that we will be the ones who stand tall and rise up to the end.

,
,The light moves in your eyes
,Reflecting more truth than speech
,I miss you in so many ways
,Frames of distant memories
,I linger on your last words
,It feels like your're already gone
,I fall into oceans of angst
,And can't shut my eyes for fear of drowning~~
,Bare now and hardly breathing
,Condense my emotion into this
,You can't understand my simple words
,You barely recognise me

,
,Reading the poets has been the dullest of things.
,Even reading the great novelists of the past, I said, "Tolstoy is supposed to be special?"
,I go to bed, I read War and Peace.
,I read it, I read it, I say, "Where is the specialist in War and Peace?"
,I really tried to understand.
,I mean, and then many of the great poets of the past, I've read their stuff.
,I've read it. All I get is a goddamn headache and boredom.
,I really feel sickness in the pit of my stomach,
,I say, "There's some trick going on here, this is not true, this is not real, it's not good."
,You see poetry itself contains as much energy as a Hollywood industry.
,As much energy as a stage play on Broadway.
,All it needs is practitioners who are alive to bring it alive.
,Poetry has always been said to be a private, hidden art.
,Not appreciated.
,The reason it's not appreciated is because it hasn't shown any guts, hasn't shown any dance, hasn't shown any moxie.
,Poetry is generally very dull, very pretensive.
,Uh, those who say the poet is very private and precious person, I don't agree with.
,Generally, he is just a dumb, fiddling asshole writing insecure lines that don't come through,
,Believing he's immortal, waiting for his immortality which never arrives.
,Because the poor fucker just can't write.
,Most poets, coets, whoets, carrots, can't even write a simple line.
,Like, "The dog walked down the street."
,Nothing should ever be done that should be done.
,It has to come out like a good hot beer shit.
,A good hot beer shit is glorious man.
,You get up, turn around, look at it and your proud.
,The fumes, the stink of the turd, you look, you say, "God, I did it. I'm good."
,
,
,Those were the years after the ice caps had melted...
,because of the greenhouse gases,
,and the oceans had risen to drown so many cities...
,along all the shorelines of the world.
,Amsterdam, Venice, New York...
,forever lost.
,Millions of people were displaced.
,Climates became chaotic.
,Hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries.
,Elsewhere, a high degree of prosperity survived...
,when most governments in the developed world...
,introduced legal sanctions to strictly license pregnancies,
,which was why robots,
,who are never hungry and who did not consume resources...
,beyond those of their first manufacture,
,were so essential an economic link...
,in the chain mail of society.
,To create an artificial being has been the dream of man...
,since the birth of science
,Not merely the beginning of the modern age...
,when our forbearers astonished the world with the first thinking machines...
,primitive monsters that could play chess
,The artificial being...
,The artificial being is a reality...
,of perfect simulacrum...
,articulated in limb
,articulate in speech...
,and not lacking in human response
,A sensory toy...
,with intelligent behavioral circuits...
,using neurone-sequencing technology...
,as old as I am
,I believe that my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a single neurone...
,can enable us to construct...
,a Mecha of a qualitatively different order
,We build a robot...
,who can love.
,Is it a game?
,Now, I'm gonna read some words
,And, uh, they won't make any sense
,but I want you to listen to them anyway...
,and look at me all the time
,Can you do that?
,Yes, Monica
,
,I'm sorry,but i don't want to be an emperor.That's not my business.
,I dont't want to rule or conquer anyone.
,I should like to help everyone if possible- Jew,Gentile-black man-white.
,We all want to help one another.Human beings are like that.
,We want to live by each other's happiness,not by each other's misery.
,We dont't want to hate and despise one another.
,In this world there is room for everyone,and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
,The way of life can be free and beautiful,but we have lost the way.
,Greed has poisoned men's souls,has barricaded the world with hate,has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
,We have developed speed,but we have shut ourselves in.
,Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
,Our knowledge has made us cynical,our cleverness hard and unkind.
,We think too much and feel too little.
,More than machinery we need humanity.
,More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
,Without these qualities,life will be violent and all will be lost.
,The airplane and the radio has brought us closer together.
,The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men.
,Cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all.
,Even now my voive is reaching millions throughout the world,
,millions of despairing men,women and little children,
,victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
,To those who can hear me , I say "Do not deapair".
,The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed.
,The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
,The hate of men will pass.
,And dictators die and the power they took from the people,will return to the people.
,And so long as men dieliverty will never perish.
,Soldiers!dont't give yourselves to brutes
,men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives.
,Tell you what to do,what to think and what to feel.
,Who drill you.diet you,treat you as cattle,use you as cannon fodder.
,Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men.
,Machine men,with machine minds and machine hearts.
,You are not machines.You are not cattle.You are men.
,You have the love of humanity in your hearts.
,You don't hate - only the unloved hate.Only the unloved and the unnatural.
,Soldiers!don't fight for slavery,fight for liberty.
,In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written
,"The kingdom of God is within man"
,Not one man,nor a group of men - but in all men - in you.
,You the people have the power,the power to create machines,the power to create happiness.
,You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful
,To make this life a wonderful adventure.
,Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite.
,Let us fight for a new world - a decent world
,that will give men a chance to work,that will give you the future and old age and security.
,By the promise of these things,brutes have risen to power,but they lie.
,They don not fulfil their promise,they never will.
,Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.
,Now let us fight to fulfil that promise.Let us fight to free the world
,To do away with national barriers,do away with greed,with hate and intolerance.
,Let us fight for a world of reason,a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.
,Soldiers! in the name of democracy,let us all unite!
,Hannah,can you hear me?Wherever you are,look up,Hannah.
,The clouds are lifting.The sun is breaking through.
,.We are coming out of the darkness into the light.
,We are coming into a new world,a kindlier world.
,where men will rise above their hate,their greed and burtality.
,Look up,Hannah.The soul of man has been given wings,and at last he is beginning to fly.
,He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope,into the furure
,the glorious future that belongs to you,to me and to all of us.
,Look up,Hannah.Look up.

,I once thought that I would know the time just to give it up
,You hold more than you think you do
,but you're letting go the best thing you have
,But you don't hold on
,and breaking hold doesn't last
,If all the times we let it drop we didn't die just a little bit
,The things we love the most
,But you break once it settles down
,You hurt and you hate the thought of never again
,You said you wouldn't break
,But you hold onto the light that's left
,It rains down
,but you take the chance or you just regret that you gave it up
,So you just hold on
,And I won't be able to let this die
,I can't just forgot this moment in my life
,And I won't be made to lose the light
,I don't want to forget
,to live with regret
,Lost
,you couldn't change how the morals fail
,you couldn't change how we fall
,

Shearwater - Meridian
 In the burning days
 Of unnatural light
 I took a long drive
 Into the evening
 On the barracks road
 past the generals' eyes
 down to the seawall
 where the waves stand by
 The enormous lull
 then the roar in the sky
 and then the searchlights
 over the airfield
 And over the ocean
 winging low
 I saw the first wave
 and the flares that fall
 like fireflies
 on the islands
 In the boom and swell
 from the waves to the heights
 reverberations
 of our old lives
 Like a golden bell
 that would ring through the night
 and then the front moves
 and we raise our eyes
 in the silence of the island

,
,When you grow up
,Your heart dies
,Who cares?
,I care
If she holla' (if, if, if she holla) let her go
Shes indecisive
She can't decide
She keeps on lookin'
From left to right
Girl, c'mon get closer
Look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong
I'm Mr. Right
You seem like the type
To love em' and leave em'
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night
To show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
Cause shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Shorty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova'
Let me show you what your missin'
Paradise
With me you're winning girl
You don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other

,There is no one can understand me truly

,I don't go out, I will keep silence

,This is me,
,for forever... one of the lost ones
,The one without a name...
,without an honest heart as compass
,This is me, for forever...
,one without a name
,This life′s the last endevaour...
,to find the missing lifeline
,Oh how I wish for soothing rain
,All I want is to dream again
,My loving heart lost in the dark
,For hope I′d give my everything...
,My flower withered between the pages two and three
,The one scent forever gloom,
,gone with my sins
,What the dark that sleep with angels call the past for help
,Touch me with your love,
,and reveal to me my true name
,Oh how I wish for soothing rain
,All I want is to dream again
,My loving heart lost in the dark
,For hope I′d give my everything...
,Oh how I wish for soothing rain
,All I want is to dream again
,My loving heart lost in the dark
,Nemo, my name forever more

,Nemo, let me go
,Oh how I wish for soothing rain

A joyous,
Magical feeling

,There where past obstacles seem
,Just pebbles on your path
,Always just a step ahead

,Bury all your secrets in my skin
,Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
,The air around me still feels like a cage
,And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…
,So if you love me, let me go.
,And run away before I know.
,My heart is just too dark to care.
,I can't destroy what isn't there.
,Deliver me into my Fate
,If I'm alone I cannot hate
,I don't deserve to have you…
,My smile was taken long ago
,If I can change I hope I never know
,I still press your letters to my lips
,And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
,I couldn't face a life without your light
,But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
,So save your breath, I will not hear.
,I think I made it very clear.
,You couldn't hate enough to love.
,Is that supposed to be enough?
,I only wish you weren't my friend.
,Then I could hurt you in the end.
,I never claimed to be a Saint…
,My own was banished long ago
,It took the Death of Hope to let you go
,So Break Yourself Against My Stones
,And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
,You Never Needed Any Help
,You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself

Running away in the autumn rain
Did you ever see a little child sleeping?
"To be near them will my sorrow drain..."
Suddenly I stopped, their bodies weren't breathing anymore
And I couln't help!
They captured my heart with their sorrow... it grows
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morninglight
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morning light
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
Carrying away the ones I love
Folden hands, they have been blessed
Now I feel angry 'bout the ones above
Just no warning, no sign
Hey, yes, I fear!
And I just really feel darkness inside
Lost without a chance to hide
Due to the ones who fear
Dance in the morning light
Due to the ones who fear
Slaves to this innocent might
See me down
Down on the ground
Hoping that nobody hears
The sound of these falling tears
Endless bleeding
Hoping that nobody sees
What you did to me!
Endless weeping
Hoping that nobody hears
The sound of these falling tears
Endless mourning
hoping that nobody knows
These feelings below
远方的姑娘 告别了等待 英雄归来
沉睡的爱情 请为我醒来 渴望许久的爱
委屈的泪水 已化作尘埃 将它深埋
残破的身躯 驱不散阴霾

来 别逃避
来 面对你自己
谁能给我勇气 刺破这华丽谎言
谁能给我力量 砸碎这虚伪荣耀

英雄路，壮士魂 烟飞并云散
归家途，思乡情 悄然漫心头


荣誉勋章 沾满热血（挣脱着命运枷锁 寻找自由的解脱）
战戟长矛 遗弃沙场（我要自己做选择）

委屈的泪水 已化作尘埃
残破的身躯 驱不散阴霾

这迷茫的双眼 褪去了昨日的灿烂 繁华已不见
这困惑的内心 期盼着彼岸 我听到是爱在召唤
也许没有答案
爱 只为不留遗憾

荣誉勋章 沾满热血（挣脱着命运枷锁 寻找自由的解脱）
战戟长矛 遗弃沙场（我要自己做选择）


远方的姑娘 告别了等待 英雄归来
沉睡的爱情 请为我醒来 渴望许久的爱
委屈的泪水 已化作尘埃 将它深埋
残破的身躯 驱不散阴霾

I know hello, hello, hello
What's the matter with the transformation?
What you've been practicing for days and nights.
While I'm watching the creation of this awful creature that no one likes.
A million tears, A trillion times

You bring me to a stare
As you wave your heart into the air

And play it safe
It's strange
How it works
Take your vices
And throw them in the drain
While you're laughin in the pouring rain
Are you sorry?
Well can you find the words?
You just say the lines that you've rehearsed
I'll walk away
And play it safe like you
I just walk away and play it cool

How it works...

,So we slip through the town
,With our heads in the clouds

From the haze in your chambers
To the legs on the stage
I’m consumed by your danger
I can lose my restraint yeah
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I’ll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on
The view from the trails from the vapors
That we burn from a kiss
Heats the stars that we strangle
And it's proof we exist
I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I’ll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on
Yeah I can take you even further
Oh yeah I
I’ll let you enter
From the stage
We shoot our guns
Then we sail off into the sun
While the cold world freezes on
Into the sun...

How come you never rest your tongue?
How can you ever expect to learn?
I know you want to chase it
But don’t want to break your stride
I know you want to taste it
But don’t want to waste your mind
I know you want to try it
so go and dive in
Taste it, like it
They’ve got you so excited
You want to climb in
Taste the violence
Between the razors and the hooks
And from the blood that you cough up
I see you want a taste,
But don’t want to wreck your life
I think you know the game,
So go ahead and take a bite
I know you want to try it,
so go and dive in
Taste it, like it
They’ve got you so excited,
You want to climb in
Taste the violence
Uncovering your eyes
Rediscovering the high

,Hiding at night.
,Not eating more than scraps.
,Sick with morning.
,Unable to sleep.
,Don't touch me.
,Don't...touch me...
,You must be hungry.I'll fix you some dinner.
,But you said he was your friend.
,But you lived through all this, do you know why?
,Perhaps I was chosen.
,That's a laugh.
,Where are you going? (Let me go!)
,You can't go out there. It’s almost sunset!
,Let me go, I said! (You can't go out there!)
,In a few minutes, (I don't care!)
,The streets will be full of them! (Let me go!)
,At least let me give you a blood test. (I don't care.)
,Don't touch me.
,Or perhaps it's because a long time ago when I worked in Panama...
,I have immunity...
,It's only a guess, but it's all I have to go on.
,You don't think that I'm immune, do you?
,It's a simple matter to find out whether you are or not.
,What will you do if I am infected?
,You are one of them.
,I was. And without that injection, I'll be one again.
,What do you mean?
,You found a solution? (That's right.)
,Exactly as you said it could be...
,I take that for it.
,I take that for it.
,"We"? "We"?
,There are quite number of us.
,Now, I want the truth.
,I want all of it. Why are you here?
,To find out if you know any more than we do.
,You know far less.
,We're alive. Infected, yes, but alive.
,You can't join us.
,You're a monster to them.
,Why do you think I ran when I saw you?
,Even thought I was assigned to spy on you.
,Because I was so terrified of what I'd heard about you.
,And you pretended to be shocked at my violence.
,
,Let us go then, you and I,
,When the evening is spread out against the sky
,Like a patient etherized upon a table;
,Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
,The muttering retreats
,Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
,And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
,Streets that follow like a tedious argument
,Of insidious intent
,To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
,Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
,Let us go and make our visit.
,In the room the women come and go
,Talking of Michelangelo.
,The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
,The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
,Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
,Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
,Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
,Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
,And seeing that it was a soft October night,
,Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.
,And indeed there will be time
,For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
,Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
,There will be time, there will be time
,To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
,There will be time to murder and create,
,And time for all the works and days of hands
,That lift and drop a question on your plate;
,Time for you and time for me,
,And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
,And for a hundred visions and revisions,
,Before the taking of a toast and tea.
,In the room the women come and go
,Talking of Michelangelo.
,And indeed there will be time
,To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I dare?"
,Time to turn back and descend the stair,
,With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
,(They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!")
,My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
,My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--
,(They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!")
,Do I dare
,Disturb the universe?
,In a minute there is time
,For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
,For I have known them all already, known them all:
,Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
,I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
,I know the voices dying with a dying fall
,Beneath the music from a farther room.
,So how should I presume?
,And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
,The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
,And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
,When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
,Then how should I begin
,To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
,And how should I presume?
,And I have known the arms already, known them all—
,Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
,(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
,Is it perfume from a dress
,That makes me so digress?
,Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
,And should I then presume?
,And how should I begin?
,Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
,And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
,Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...
,I should have been a pair of ragged claws
,Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
,And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
,Smoothed by long fingers,
,Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
,Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
,Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
,Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
,But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
,Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
,I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;
,I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
,And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
,And in short, I was afraid.
,And would it have been worth it, after all,
,After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
,Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
,Would it have been worth while,
,To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
,To have squeezed the universe into a ball
,To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
,To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
,Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"—
,If one, settling a pillow by her head,
,  Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;
,  That is not it, at all."
,And would it have been worth it, after all,
,Would it have been worth while,
,After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
,After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
,And this, and so much more?—
,It is impossible to say just what I mean!
,But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
,Would it have been worth while
,If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
,And turning toward the window, should say:
,"That is not it at all,
,That is not what I meant, at all."
,No I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
,Am an attendant lord, one that will do
,To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
,Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
,Deferential, glad to be of use,
,Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
,Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
,At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
,Almost, at times, the Fool.
,I grow old ... I grow old ...
,I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
,Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
,I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
,I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
,I do not think that they will sing to me.
,I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
,Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
,When the wind blows the water white and black.
,We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
,By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
,Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
,
,
,
,So you say, that you've lost it
,You're acting out reality
,The mask you wear it seems so true, at times
,The burned out end of the trailer park
,Reach out your hands to touch the sky
,The morning comes with all it's lies
,You seem to cry
,You seem to have run out of time
,You can't get by
,You've given up wondering why
,Singing, is that all that life brings
,And then
,You gave it all, you look for more
,You're dreaming of a thousand rooms
,You wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh
,The world is here in the trailer park
,Singing, is that all that life brings to me?
,Look at you.
,Why don't you do something with your life?!
,You sit around here all day,
,You contribute nothing to society!
,You're just taking up space!
,How could I be with someone like you?!
,Wouldn't respect myself.

, You cannot get to Heaven by religion! By the way,
, don't you ever refer to Christianity as religion.
, It's NOT religion! Praise God, it's a person (...)
, Jesus Christ. Someone said,
,'Well, so-and-so got religion and that's all he has,
, he's going to to hell'.
,You don't get to heaven by religion;
, you get to heaven through Jesus Christ.
,When you come to Jesus, you don't turn over a leaf.
, It's NOT reformation, but it's regeneration!
,
, The world wears its skirt three inches above the knee,
, so Christian girls come over here
,and wear their skirts two inches above the knees.
, The world moves over here to five inches,
,Christian girls move over there to four inches.
,Where is the end? Where is the end?
,I am afraid that the world has neutralized our testimony
, so you can't tell the difference from
,the world and the Church. Someone said, '
,Well, you know, you can't reach men preaching
, like you did twenty years ago.'
,You know how you reach men today?
,By preaching the same way Jesus Christ
,did 2000 years ago.
,
,
,So I ask you.
,
,When someone goes into that chapel
,and they fall on their knees
,and they pray to God
,that their wife doesn't miscarry
,or that their daughter doesn't bleed to death
,or that their mother doesn't suffer acute neural trauma from postoperative shock,
,who do you think they're praying to?
,
,Now you go ahead and read your Bible, Dennis
,and you go to your church
,and with any luck you might even win the annual raffle.
,But if you're looking for God,
,he was in operating room number two,
,on November 17,
,and he doesn't like being second guessed.
,
,You ask me if I have a God complex?
,Let me tell you something..
,
,I am God!

,I should have released my grasp,
,but it was hard for me too.
,
,All that was done,
,you have failed to capture us.
,Speak spoken love,
,offer nothing from your heart.
,
,I read your note, and I know just what you want to hear.
,It hurts less over time, but I’m not getting stronger. I just leave pieces behind.
,I can only fall so many times before I’m broke, unrecognizable.
,Now all I’ve left to give is the piece that still remains, and you bring the pieces back.
,Love, it only reconstructs the pain.
,As time fails to elapse, I’m finding you were everything to me.
,Now my future and my past are ending tragically the same
,
,
,And now I think my faith is weakening.
,And just as you bring me back, you push me from the ledge.

,Cold rain fell down my face when I just looked around
,An old man walked to me
,Begged for some pence
,I found out all my pockets and gave him all the coins
,He was moved and he said to me
,"Son,I'll pay you a great great light."
,He directed me a way and pointed a broken neon light
,He said:"just go and press the button, and let it on"
,("To find what you want")
,I did what he told me
,Oh what a bright shine in the sky
,I just looked around looking for
,He was no there
,Now I awake from my dream and come close to the window
,I want to find the light and now I want the bright
,Time time flies, his face dims in my mind
,But I will always remember what a beautiful shine in the rainy night

나는 알수 있어
포기 따윈 없어
힘들때 참은 눈물 모아서
기쁠때 흘리겠어
나는 믿고 있어
보여주고 싶어
세상에 내가 못할 일들은
어디에도 없단걸
For My Life 내가 그릴래
내 가슴에 나의 미래
나빴던 기억도 하얗게 칠해 가릴래
몸이 아닌 마음으로 입는
멋진 옷 내 손으로
만들어 볼거야 Change Of My Life
- 간주중 -
아직 모르겠어
나를 보는 시선
사람들의 눈속에 비치는
내 모습은 어떨까
나는 자신있어
모두 내곁에서
부러움에 가득한 표정만
짓게 만들수 있어
For My Life 내가 그릴래
내 가슴에 나의 미래
나빴던 기억도 하얗게 칠해 가릴래
몸이 아닌 마음으로 입는
멋진 옷 내 손으로
만들어 볼거야 Change Of My Life
깜짝 놀란 얼굴을 생각하면
벌써 부터 설레는 걸
변한 날 보는 많은 사람들
For My Life 넓은 하늘도
내 맘대로 그림처럼
상상해 볼거야 세상 제일 큰 액자로
언제라도 웃고 싶을땐 마음도
간지럽히는 해피 디자이너
내가 되주겠어

There's something in the way you crucify me,
it makes me smile
And when you offer up your sacrament you
drown the whole world in your bile
You can sail on waves of shit and type your
pointless, ancient fingers to the bone
But when your vessel sinks you'll drown in it
and know that you've done
Nothing of your own
There's something in the way you evil eye me
and throw your glare
They can masquerade as fire but behind your
eyes there's nothing but dead air
You admire your reflection staring back at you
from pools of shallow prose
But when you meet yourself in mirrors you will
know that you've done nothing of your own
I think I'm gonna die awhile, I'm gonna hang on
wood and try to smile
And when the peasents with their pitchforks
come
I'm gonna spit blood down on everyone
They're all scum

if this is today - well what the fuck's tomorrow?
whose fashion is your fashion?
what passion can you buy?
when you know god is dead
and you are god?

Tiny indiscretion blown up to a tragedy
I didn't need a lecture I wanted you
To spend some time
Choking on the sadness
This car rides a funeral
Victory's so dirty it festers in the back of my mind
My mind......
My mind......
My mind......
My mind......
oooooo
It's been three days
Since you left me
And I'm as cold as a stone
It's been three days since you left
And I am not whole
Tying these dreams to my bedpost
Tying this noose to my neck.....
Wishing you'd some how come back
Come back home again
ooooooo
Count the days
Count the days
Till I see your face again
Now come back
come back
to you....
Count the days
Count the days
Till I see your face again
Now come back
come back
to you....
Count the days
Count the days
Till I see your face again
Now come back
come back
to you....

,I've found that sometimes I am able to control a dream and sometimes I’m able to direct myself before going to sleep, to dream about a certain subject, and sometimes not.
,The import thing was to see your hands in the dream. And I made an effort to do this a number of times, and… only a couple of times that I succeed,
,and actually seeing my hand in the dream.
,To me what the most important new facts about dreams is that they are biological necessity. See, They have made experiments of waking people up whenever they start to dream, they can tell by the rapid eye movements, and also by the brain waves. Brain waves and dreams are very much like the brain waves of people when they’re awake.
,And if they keep interfering with the REM sleep, as a dream sleep, and very soon some people show all the symptoms and sleeplessness, no matter how much a dreamless sleep they’re allowed, and eventually will be fatal with them to wake yourself.
,So, we know now that dreams are a biological necessity, which means they must serve very important function.
,The next step is to go into space and leave the planet, but we’re not there yet.
,Here we have an artifact weighting about 170 pounds that cannot exist outside the very specialized environment, sort of a whole aquanaut.
,The official space programs, how do they purposed to solve this is they are going to move the whole artifact, the human artifact, xxxx from one place to another. It wouldn’t occur to them to start from the other end.
,You have an object access human body and you want to transport axe to space, you need an ax, and axes are heavy, and they can only live in a whole medium, so why not alter ax to reduce the weight and its dependency on the medium, that seems a logical approach, problem.
,And this will not occur to the official progress because they accept the human artifact with all its limitations.
,In a fact, they accepted limitation imposed by Chris XX by what Crawley called the slave gods.
,Now uh... it’s…he human body is much dense to xxx conditions, we have a model to hand and that is less dense,in fact almost weightless and they would be an astro dreambody.
,So the functions of dreams maybe are to prepare us for space and that’s why they are biological necessity. But we’re not there yet.

,Roses in the spring bloomed, everything died too soon
,Cut away all the pain
,You could never feel me
,You don't want to anyway
,I know I'd just hurt you
,I think about it everyday
,Love never lasts, even to your own
,It's never unconditional
,Devoured all your power, I am not a flower
,You're not my creator
,You're not my creator

《The Southern Side of The Mountain/山峦之南》
,
, 作词 : Bob Dylan
,The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
,And play games with each other in their sand-box world
,And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
,That run around gallant
,And make all rules for the ones that got talent
,And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
,And think they're foolin' you
,The ones who jump on the wagon
,Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
,To get their kicks, get out of it quick
,And make all kinds of money and chicks
,And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
,Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
,Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
,Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
,Good God Almighty
,That stuff ain't real"
,No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
,You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
,You gotta look some other place
,And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
,Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
,Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
,Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
,Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
,And out there somewhere
,And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
,Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
,Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
,You can touch and twist
,And turn two kinds of doorknobs
,You can either go to the church of your choice
,Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
,You'll find God in the church of your choice
,You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
,And though it's only my opinion
,I may be right or wrong
,You'll find them both
,In the Grand Canyon
,At sundown
,I wanted so badly to be able to protect her.
,That was all I could think about,
,as I gazed absently out of the window.
,
,Find you,
,love you,
,marry you
,and live without shame.
,
,I love you.
,Come back,
,come back to me.
,
,
,Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick
,Don't lose faith
,I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going
,Was that I loved what I did
,You've got to find what you love
,And that is true for work as it is for your lovers
,Your work's going to fill a large part of your life
,And the only way to be truly satisfied
,Is to do what you believe is great work
,And the only way to do great work
,Is to love what you do
,If you haven't found it yet
,Keep looking, and don't settle
,As with all matters of the heart
,You'll know when you find it
,And, like any great relationship
,It just gets better and better as the years roll on
,So keep looking, don't settle
,
,My third story was about death
,When I was 17
,I read a quote that went something like
,"if you live each day as if it was your last
,Someday you'll most certainly be right."
,It made an impression on me
,And since then, for the past 33 years
,I've looked in mirror every morning and asked myself
,If today were the last day of my life
,Would I want to do what I'm about to do today
,And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row
,I know I need to change something
,Remembering that I'll be dead soon
,Is the most important tool I've ever encountered
,To help me make the big choices in life
,Because almost everything
,All external expectations, all pride
,All fear of embarrassment of failure
,These things just fall away in the face of death
,Living only what is truly important
,Remembering that you're going to die
,Is the best way I know
,To avoid the trap of thinking
,You have something to lose
,
,No one wants to die
,Even people who want to go to Heaven
,Don't wan die to get there
,And yet, death is the destination we all share
,No one has ever escaped it
,And that is, as it should be
,Because death is every likely the single best invention of life
,It's life's change agent
,It clears out the old to make way for the new
,Right now, the new is you
,
,Your time is limited
,So don't waste it living in someone else's life
,Don't be trapped by dogma
,which is living with the results of other people's thinking
,Don't let the noise and others' opinions drown out your own inner voice
,And most important
,Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
,They somehow already know
,What you truly want to become
,Everything else is secondary

,So why did I do it?
,I could offer a million answers, all false.

,Whatever you say is too late.
,Please, don't do this!
,Done.
,Now, please go, or I'll call security.

,你却跟他拆了城墙
,踩过我用挚爱建筑的天堂

,你用一夜拆了城墙
,踩碎我曾让你栖息的胸膛

,I think I’m losing you, but I will never regret choosing you
,Because I am in love, and for now that will be enough
,And the ones around me convince me that I was the only person who was dumb enough to believe that you and I had hope.
,But now I know even after you began to let your emotions slow the only reason I stood alone was because I was the only one who knew our love was never going to let go.
,Everyone wanted me to see that we could no thrive, so gouge out my eyes.
,Because if this is reality then I guess I’m not alive,
,Because I don’t know a life in where I can’t make things right.
,And when life teaches you to drive and you finally say goodbye
,And you won’t let me stand by your side
,Ill know that though some feelings are hurt, none will have died.
,Cause I used to stay up at night and picture myself looking into your eyes
,Shouting as you would sigh “how dare you think you can fall asleep with water dripping from the kitchen sink, how dare you think you can fall asleep with all these little leaks in this home we built in our dreams”
,A picture is worth a thousand words or whatever people say to me.
,It’s hard to believe when your mind is lost and in need,
,And all you can picture is a memory inside of someone else’s sheets.
,A prayer that nothing will keep,
,A hope that light will seek before the dark sinks too deep.
,Or at least the sinking feeling inside of me will decrease when the release of perceived dreams burn in the flame of feeling free.
,So feel free to be free if that’s what you need.
,And if someday you feel alone and everything caves in when you try to breathe,
,Know that you are not alone as far as I can see,
,Because you were everything to me.
,Through this I have realized that if I were God we would have all just died,
,Because darling you were mine and now I feel so dead inside,
,And what good am I if all I can create is a projection of my own mind.
,A dream of finding time to remind you that I’m still here and I’m not fine.
,And darling if you’re going to leave just remember who you are,
,And do what you can to remember me.
,Maybe someday we can talk about our past and we can talk about the weather.
,Whenever you leave I don’t care what I’m remembered for,
,I just want to be remembered.
,Because even if I failed you at least I tried,
,And maybe our lives don’t add up now but someday our graves will look the same when we both die.
,And if I had a chance I’d give you one last kiss and I’d bite down on your lip
,And I’d try to puncture it so you’ll never forget that time,
,But you’ll always regret.
,And darling I know sometimes life will take a turn for the worst,
,And sometimes life will even hurt.
,And I know some days, some days you’ll be afraid of the lessons you’ll have to learn
,And some days you’ll even feel burned,
,And I want to let you know that I want to love you through them.
,But I always get what I deserve.

Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue
Colors changing hue
Morning field of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless head on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in the ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

,-Goddamn it, Andrew!
,If you're going to succeed at this thing...
,-What thing?
,-This...this thing you're trying to do...
,You've got to stop being so damn deferential.
,-I can't help being deferential. It's built-in.
,-Then change.
,-Change? I have changed.
,-I don't mean on the outside. Change on the inside.
,Take chances, make mistakes.
,-Mistakes?
,-Yes! Sometimes it's important not to be perfect, okay?
,It's important to do the wrong thing!
,-Do the wrong thing?
,-Yes.
,-Why? Oh I see. To learn from your mistakes.
,-No. To make them!
,To find out what's real and what's not, to find out what you feel.
,Human beings are terrible messes, Andrew.
,-I'll grant you that. I see.
,This is what is known as an irrational conversation, isn't it?
,-No, this is a human conversation.
,It's not about being rational. It's about following your heart.
,-And that's what I should do?
,-Yes. And you have a heart, Andrew. You do.
,I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes, but I do feel it.
,-And in order to follow that heart... one must do the wrong thing.
,-Yes.
,-Thank you.
,
,-So you're not married yet?
,-No, two weeks from Saturday.
,-I'm not too late.
,Are you absolutely positive you're doing the right thing?
,-Positive?
,-About getting married?
,-I'm never absolutely positive about anything.
,-So you could be doing the wrong thing.
,-No, I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing.
,-Great.
,-Why is that great?
,-Well, in your apartment, you told me to do the wrong thing.
,Now, you are not doing the wrong thing. You're doing the right thing.
,It's safe to say you're not following your own advice.
,'Cause if you were, you would definitely not be marrying this man, Charles.
,-Because I would be doing the right thing.
,-Precisely.
,-In some strange way, you're starting to make sense.
,-Good.
,Do you have any idea what it's like to be in love with someone...who's about to marry someone else?
,Someone totally magnificent, someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun?
,Someone who you know is lying to herself?
,-Lying?
,-Convincingly, yeah. Very, very much so.
,-About what?
,-That you don't love me.
,When I know at least in some way you do.
,-And how do you know that?
,-Portia.
,I have done everything, inside and out.
,-But that stuff doesn't matter to me.
,-Well, something matters
,'Cause I'd have to believe if nothing mattered, you'd love me...
,And not some man whose chin could sink the Titanic.
,- What? See? It's true, isn't it?
,-Yeah.
,-I'm sorry.
,Does he light you up like this? Does he make you laugh?
,-Nobody makes me laugh like this.
,-Good. Then admit it. Admit that you love me.
,Give me one kiss.
,-Oh, God.
,-That's all. One quick kiss.
,Just one kiss...could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.
,Besides, it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.
,Your respiration rate has doubled. You're putting out clouds of pheromones.
,-It's not fair to read me like that.
,-I know. Love isn't fair.
,I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you to follow it.
,Begging you.
,Begging is supposed to be humiliating. I don't care.
,I love you, Portia.
,I loved you the very first moment I saw you.

,Reaping the loneliness I've sown
,In these fields I've always grown
,Digging the blackness from my mind

每首我都会仔细听，有时觉得还不错，
有时真的觉得普普通通，相信你也会一样，
在我那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
但有那么一瞬间，我们两人同步了。
每首对的音乐响起，雀跃了四周颜色，
我们不知不觉翩翩起舞，在彼此的心里面，
在你那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
天各一边，同时按下播放键，

Access into the deep, to meet the anglerfish.
Vampire of the abyss, and a black devil.
Even with outer space as a final frontier,
Mysteries remain here on earth.
If you meet these creatures face to face.
Now you see they are all aliens.
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Thousands of meters from the water’s surface.
Submerge into the dark, beneath the crushing pressure.
Sparkling ocean floor, inside an endless silence
Even with outer space as a final frontier,
Mysterious remain here on earth.
If you meet these creatures face to face.
Now you see they are all aliens.
Dive dive into eternal night

她从来不与人交换眼神，仿佛从未落入凡尘，
在下一个转角是否,有故事发生呢？
一切都以美感作为标准，自己就是艺术本身，
观影过程如此神圣，没人敢再出声。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。
雷同的剧情, 无法酣畅淋漓，
对不起，对不起，对不起，对不起。
又在同一幕布景里醉了，同一句台词处哭了。
真人或者角色究竟,谁才是扁平的？
她只能不厌其烦地重温，假装每次都是新的，
定格在了最后一帧，心却还在扑通着。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。
矛盾的语境，无法不言自明，
对不起，对不起，对不起，对不起。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。

Time now to pay up
But if you’re not early
Well then you’re not timely
Promised so much you see
Time now to pay up
Oh no....
Profits need you
Cause we’re almost out of time
All the slaves on assembly line
Profits need you
Oh, look out for that deadline
And don’t stop we’re running behind
Must see it through
Must see this through
Must execute
Too much to do
Get done see it through 
Live PDQ
Die PDQ
Must work, pursue
Endless pursuit
Ceaseless pursuit 
Carry it through
Profits need you
Profits need you
Profits need you
Oh, look out for that deadline

Your lunch belongs to us
Now you’re too tired to listen
Man hurry, hurry up

Be more patient I hear them say
Would if I were you
Life is too short I hear them say
But why listen to you
Blinded 
Afraid of things I can’t see
Crawling through the shadows
This darkness is endless
Look into the sky
Find the dance of burning lights 
Night sky 
From this satellite
When it turns black revealing 
The shortness of our sight
The world that spins around me
Much smaller than it seems to be
So I escape 
Into the fade
Flying inward 
My mirror dream
Shining stars that I know
Their dust is
Running through my blood... my blood...
Night sky
From this satellite 
When it turns black revealing 
The shortness of our sight
The world that spins around me
Much smaller than it seems to be
So I escape into the fade
Beyond the night sky
Beyond the blue sky
Beyond the black sky 
Beyond the night sky

说众生平等，要社保。
说众生平等，要社保。

今天是财务报表，
明天是员工检讨。

说不想上班，要奔跑。
说不想上班，要奔跑。

Outside it’s still sunny
My thoughts are all muddy 
Breathe in and the hairs on my skin rise
Black clouds form above me
You, I would see it’s you
This too, I would see is you
Fangs siphon the honey out
Speak the word
Fight the word
Fear the word
Our cycle
Blissful then turns painful
Your touch has
tapped into my brain though
I’m passive when it comes to fate so 
Arms open
Why can’t I feel you?
Love, foul love, foul love
When I’m near you
 I can see you
And I hear you
Why can’t I feel you?
Now the rain starts falling
And your voice comes calling
Those eels your body conceals
Move to start spine crawling
Our cycle 
Blissful then turns hate-full
Your flesh has got me so deranged, though
I’m hostile
All up in that face hole
Eyes open
Why can’t I feel you?
I failed in love
I won’t fail in life 
Time I be alone
Time I feel right
I’ll stop feeding it roses
Time I play it right
I’m simple when it comes to bait, though
Jaws open, why can’t I feel you?

,-Goddamn it, Andrew!
,If you're going to succeed at this thing...
,-What thing?
,-This...this thing you're trying to do...
,You've got to stop being so damn deferential.
,-I can't help being deferential. It's built-in.
,-Then change.
,-Change? I have changed.
,-I don't mean on the outside. Change on the inside.
,Take chances, make mistakes.
,-Mistakes?
,-Yes! Sometimes it's important not to be perfect, okay?
,It's important to do the wrong thing!
,-Do the wrong thing?
,-Yes.
,-Why? Oh I see. To learn from your mistakes.
,-No. To make them!
,To find out what's real and what's not, to find out what you feel.
,Human beings are terrible messes, Andrew.
,-I'll grant you that. I see.
,This is what is known as an irrational conversation, isn't it?
,-No, this is a human conversation.
,It's not about being rational. It's about following your heart.
,-And that's what I should do?
,-Yes. And you have a heart, Andrew. You do.
,I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes, but I do feel it.
,-And in order to follow that heart... one must do the wrong thing.
,-Yes.
,-Thank you.
,
,-So you're not married yet?
,-No, two weeks from Saturday.
,-I'm not too late.
,Are you absolutely positive you're doing the right thing?
,-Positive?
,-About getting married?
,-I'm never absolutely positive about anything.
,-So you could be doing the wrong thing.
,-No, I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing.
,-Great.
,-Why is that great?
,-Well, in your apartment, you told me to do the wrong thing.
,Now, you are not doing the wrong thing. You're doing the right thing.
,It's safe to say you're not following your own advice.
,'Cause if you were, you would definitely not be marrying this man, Charles.
,-Because I would be doing the right thing.
,-Precisely.
,-In some strange way, you're starting to make sense.
,-Good.
,Do you have any idea what it's like to be in love with someone...who's about to marry someone else?
,Someone totally magnificent, someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun?
,Someone who you know is lying to herself?
,-Lying?
,-Convincingly, yeah. Very, very much so.
,-About what?
,-That you don't love me.
,When I know at least in some way you do.
,-And how do you know that?
,-Portia.
,I have done everything, inside and out.
,-But that stuff doesn't matter to me.
,-Well, something matters
,'Cause I'd have to believe if nothing mattered, you'd love me...
,And not some man whose chin could sink the Titanic.
,- What? See? It's true, isn't it?
,-Yeah.
,-I'm sorry.
,Does he light you up like this? Does he make you laugh?
,-Nobody makes me laugh like this.
,-Good. Then admit it. Admit that you love me.
,Give me one kiss.
,-Oh, God.
,-That's all. One quick kiss.
,Just one kiss...could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.
,Besides, it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.
,Your respiration rate has doubled. You're putting out clouds of pheromones.
,-It's not fair to read me like that.
,-I know. Love isn't fair.
,I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you to follow it.
,Begging you.
,Begging is supposed to be humiliating. I don't care.
,I love you, Portia.
,I loved you the very first moment I saw you.

,Here`s the point
,If we consider the huge maze of possible universes
,The vast majority will not have conditions hospitable to life
,Or at least to anything remotely akin to life as we know it
,For drastic changes in familiar physics
,This is clear
,If our universe didn`t conform to the rules it does
,life, as we know it, would not exist
,Even rather conservative changes to physics would interfere with the formation of stars
,For example
,Disrupting their ability to act as cosmic furnaces
,That synthesize complex life-supporting atoms
,Such as carbon and oxygen
,That normally are spewed throughout the universe
,By supernova explosions
,In the light of the sensitive dependence of life on the details of physics
,If we now ask, for instance
,Why the forces and particles of nature have the particular properties we observe
,A possible answer emerges
,Across the entire gamut of possibilities
,These features vary widely
,Properties could be different
,What`s special about the particular combination of particle and force properties we observe
,Is that clearly they allow life to form
,And life, intelligent life in particular
,Is a prerequisite even to ask the question of why our universe
,Has the properties it does
,In plain language
,Things are the way they are
,Because if they weren`t
,We wouldn`t be here to notice
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see
,The lack of politics and factories
,The gods at stake
,The myopic view
,Halts suspicion that it just might be true
,Your sense of awe
,Your sense of wonder
,Remains intact in the face of it all
,Perhaps in time
,Someone will listen to this waste of breath
,This lecture on nothing
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see

Bye bye, bye bye
Tears come
In my eyes
Bye bye

And we were free
Free

,Took the breath from my open mouth,
,Never known how it broke me down,
,I went in circles somewhere else
,Shook the best when you love was home,
,Storing up on your summer glow,
,you went in search of someone else
,And I hear your ship is comin’ in
,Your tears a sea for me to swim
,And I hear a storm is comin’ in
,My dear is it all we’ve ever been?
,Caught the air in your woven mouth,
,Leave it all I’ll be heaving how you went
,In search of someone else
,Taught the hand that taut the bride,
,Both our eyes lock to the tide
,We went in circles somewhere else
,And I hear your ship is comin’ in
,Your tears a sea for me to swim
,And I hear a storm is comin’ in

,
If you close the door
Just turn off the lights now
The world looks better into the dark
Between the curtains somebody's watching
Oh sail me the moon
Before it's too late
Son't kess me goodbye baby
I turn around since too much time
Those railroad tracks
Will swallow my mind
I try so hard to stop waisting my life
If only I could just make you mine
Don't kiss me goodbye

,Mustang cabriolet
,Les chevaux du moteur
,Au plein coeur d'une averse
,Les excès de l'ivresse
,S'affichaient au compteur

,Un soir que l'on filait

,Un amour ordinaire
,Nos meilleurs souvenirs
,S'endormaient sur le cuir
,De la banquette arrière
,.
,Et devant nous l'espace
,Nos reflets dans la crasse
,Dans la course un peu lasse
,Des balais d'essuie-glaces
,Et devant nous l'espace
,Les regrets qui s'effacent
,Au rythme de la valse
,Des balais d'essuie-glaces

,Mustang cabriolet
,La course des nuages
,En plein coeur de la pluie
,Des torrents de folie torrents de

,Mustang cabriolet
,Dans un état d'urgence
,Disparissait la peur

,Our love was comfortable
,Once upon a time
,Stretched out and worn in like
,Chill sunday nights
,Guess I forgot what it's like
,Not to try
,But I think about sometimes
,I still think about you
,You like some new chick she seems like your type
,She strokes your ego and buys all the hype
,I used to say you aint shit and we'd die
,Laughing about it all night
,I still think about you
,And I'm not sad it's over
,Just high like all the time
,Cuz I can't find another
,You set the bar too high
,And Ima keep singing about you
,Ima keep singing about you
,Makeup and hair and a dress that's too tight
,Out with some guy that I don't even like
,I miss your mouth we were so impolite
,And I think about you sometimes
,I still think about you
,And I'm not sad it's over
,Just high like all the time
,Cuz I can't find another
,You set the bar too high
,And ima keep singing about you
,Ima keep singing about you
,Singing like
,La la la la la la la la la la
,La la la la la la la la la la
,Ima keep on writing these songs about you
,Cuz I don't know what else to write about
,Boy you know that you stay on my brain
,I can't figure out a way to get you out

,I'm so alive

,This is my winter song to you
,The storm is coming soon
,It rolls in from the sea
,My voice: a beacon in the night
,My words will be your light to carry you to me
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love?
,They say that things just cannot grow
,Beneath the winter snow
,Or so I have been told
,They say we're buried far
,Just like a distant star
,I simply cannot hold
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love?
,This is my winter song
,December never felt so long
,'Cause you're not where you belong
,Inside my arms
,I still believe in summer days
,The seasons always change
,And life will find a way
,I'll be your harvester of light
,And send it out tonight
,So we can start again
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?

,Two years full of tears
,From looking at your face on the wall
,Just a week ago you were my baby
,Now I don't even know you at all
,I don't know you at all
,Well I wish that you would
,call me right now
,So that I could get through to you somehow
,But I guess it's safe to say baby

,to persuade the guard to change his mind and allow him to enter.
,His sight has dimmed,
,but in the darkness he perceives a radiance
,streaming immortally from the door of the Law.
,And now, before he dies,
,all he's experienced condenses into one question, a question he's never asked.
,He beckons to the guard.
,Says the guard, "You are insatiable! What is it now?"
,Says the man, "Every man strives to attain the Law.“
,How is it then that in all these years, no one else has ever come here, seeking admittance?"
,His hearing has failed, so the guard yells into his ear,
,"No one else but you could ever have obtained admittance!“
,No one else could enter this door!
,This door was intended only for you!

,People like me have husbands..screwing someone else far more perfect than me.
,People like me have sons who hate them.
,And I've screamed horrible things to him..a seven-year-old, because he doesn't want..to get in the car at the end of the day.

,And a dark wind blows
,The government is corrupt
,And we're on so many drugs
,With the radio on and the curtains drawn
,We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
,And the machine is bleeding to death
,The sun has fallen down
,And the billboards are all leering
,And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
,It went like this:
,The buildings tumbled in on themselves
,Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble
,And pulled out their hair
,The skyline was beautiful on fire
,All twisted metal stretching upwards
,Everything washed in a thin orange haze
,I said: "kiss me, you're beautiful -
,These are truly the last days"
,You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
,Like a daydream or a fever
,
,We woke up one morning and fell a little further down -
,For sure it's the valley of death
,I open up my wallet
,And it's full of blood
,
,Do I feel happy in life?
,Emm, let's see
,I hope I'm finding happiness

I found the answer... open your hands.
Reach out, distance enough, and fair maiden in hand,
All in all, we ain't... 
But, we press on!
I'm sorry, but 
I don't want to be an emperor. 
That's not my business. 
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. 
I should like to help everyone if possible; 
Jew, Gentile, black man, white. 
We all want to help one another. 
Human beings are like that. 
We want to live by each others happiness, not by each others misery. 
We don't want to hate and despise one another. 
In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. 
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. 
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. 
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. 
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. 
Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. 
We think too much and feel too little. 
More than machinery, we need humanity. 
More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. 
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. 
The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. 
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. 
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. 
To those who can hear me, 
I say, do not despair. 
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. 
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. 
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. 
Soldiers! 
Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! 
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. 
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! 
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! 
You have the love of humanity in your hearts! 
You don't hate! 
Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. 
Soldiers! 
Don't fight for slavery! 
Fight for liberty! 
In the seventeenth chapter of 
St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of 
God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! 
In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! 
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. 
Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. 
Let us all unite. 
Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. 
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. 
But they lie! 
They do not fulfill that promise. 
They never will! 
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. 
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. 
Let us fight to free the world! 
To do away with national barriers! 
To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! 
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. 
Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!" - Charles ChaplinDon't set the sun or let hearts grow dim. Return back to the hill that you left, with the city in your hands and if nothings left, well, the forest marches on. Forget not who you are. Children of the sun. My point is,salt is on the ground,the cast are on their way,and the audience is set.Now that we have painted faith, shout, "
Victory is ours!"

,根本不在乎
,那些法律的保护
,在我心里只有道德在约束着我的路
,黑色是我的思想和态度
,上帝在帮助脱离贫穷跟痛苦
,只留下对黑色的尊重
,一直等待着这个黑夜的结束
,近朱者赤
,近墨者黑
,面对着社会是进是退
,在压力的面前只有强者能面对
,抱怨太多也根本伤害不了社会
,当你闭上双眼才看清我的颜色
,黑暗使人的性格变的堕落
,机会只有一次 我们必须把握
,因为最后一线光明不会在你面前闪过
,一个人的力量有限
,各色的谎言 都是对我的训练
,欺骗 是对我忍耐力的考验
,只有真正的说唱精神永远不会改变
,就好象说话的时候我喜欢看着你的眼睛
,黑色的眼睛给我黑色的力量
,政治压力再大
,不代表我会害怕
,当你撑不住的时候我们不会倒下
,黑 是我的角色
,认真的选择
,平凡的生活有着太多无奈的苦涩
,接受不了的折磨 是重复的生活
,压力跟挫折
,我有我的对策
,实力也许悬殊 保持住风度
,隐藏自己的愤怒并把痛苦给记住
,现实社会没有人会因为无辜给予帮助
,一切都是过渡 但会有人为此付出
,黑色的眼睛不再表达真实
,每个人的行为都在有所掩饰
,可以原谅无知 但请别讲故事
,没完没了的欺骗我会渐渐失去控制
,内心的阴影使得思想变的僵硬
,命运并不公平 但我庆幸我清醒
,静座长思已过
,闲谈莫论人非
,黑色的态度来面对这个社会

,溜出时代银行的后门
,撕开夜幕和喑哑的平原
,越过淡季森林和电
,牵引我们黑暗的心
,在愿望的最后一个季节
,解散清晨还有黄昏
,在愿望的最后一个季节
,记起我曾身藏利刃
,是谁来自山川湖海
,却囿于昼夜厨房与爱
,来到自我意识的边疆
,看到父亲坐在云端抽烟
,他说孩子去和昨天和解吧
,就像我们从前那样
,用无限适用于未来的方法
,置换体内星辰河流
,用无限适用于未来的方法
,热爱聚合又离散的鸟群
,是谁来自山川湖海
,却囿于昼夜厨房与爱
,是谁来自山川湖海
,却囿于昼夜厨房与爱
,就在一瞬间
,就在一瞬间握紧我矛盾密布的手
,
,树叶凋落，它平静地向上飞去了
,记忆完整，是关于虫子的故事
,天冷了，窝在哪儿？
,在树的翅膀下吗？
,青鸟儿，快带来些温暖的消息吧
,它眨眼飞走了，飞走了
,挤出泪，如同胶水
,这粘稠的讥笑
,我失望地拒绝了它
,小羽毛，你也要离开了吗？
,在南方你也能自如地蜕皮吗？
,在南方你也能自如地蜕皮吗？

,Love, it only reconstructs the pain.
,As time fails to elapse, I’m finding you were everything to me.
,Now my future and my past are ending tragically the same
,
,
,And now I think my faith is weakening.
,And just as you bring me back, you push me from the ledge.

,I wanted so badly to be able to protect her.
,That was all I could think about,
,as I gazed absently out of the window.
How can I repay you, brother mine?
How can I expect you to forgive?
Clinging to the past, I shed our blood.
And shattered your chance to live.
Though I knew the laws, I payed no heed.
How can I return your wasted breath?
What I did not know has cost you dear,
For there is no cure for death.
Beautiful mother, soft and sweet,
Once you were gone we were not complete.
Back through the years we reached for you,
Alas 'twas not meant to be.
And how can I make amends?
For all that I took from you?
I led you with hopeless dreams,
My brother, I was a fool.
Don't cry for the past now, brother mine.
Neither you nor I are free from blame.
Nothing can erase the things we did,
For the path we took was the same.
Beautiful mother, soft and sweet,
Once you were gone we were not complete.
Back through the years we reached for you,
Alas 'twas not meant to be.
My dreams made me blind and mute.
I long to return to that time.
I followed without a word,
My brother the fault is mine.
So where do we go from here?
And how to forget and forgive?
What's gone is forever lost.
Now all we can do is live.

,It's important to do the wrong thing!
,-Do the wrong thing?
,-Yes.
,-Why? Oh I see. To learn from your mistakes.
,-No. To make them!
,To find out what's real and what's not, to find out what you feel.
,Human beings are terrible messes, Andrew.
,-I'll grant you that. I see.
,This is what is known as an irrational conversation, isn't it?
,-No, this is a human conversation.
,It's not about being rational. It's about following your heart.
,-And that's what I should do?
,-Yes. And you have a heart, Andrew. You do.
,I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes, but I do feel it.

,-No, I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing.
,-Great.
,-Why is that great?
,-Well, in your apartment, you told me to do the wrong thing.
,Now, you are not doing the wrong thing. You're doing the right thing.
,It's safe to say you're not following your own advice.
,'Cause if you were, you would definitely not be marrying this man, Charles.
,-Because I would be doing the right thing.
,-Precisely.
,-In some strange way, you're starting to make sense.
,-Good.
,Do you have any idea what it's like to be in love with someone...who's about to marry someone else?
,Someone totally magnificent, someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun?
,Someone who you know is lying to herself?
,-Lying?
,-Convincingly, yeah. Very, very much so.
,-About what?
,-That you don't love me.
,When I know at least in some way you do.
,-And how do you know that?
,-Portia.
,I have done everything, inside and out.

,- What? See? It's true, isn't it?
,-Yeah.
,-I'm sorry.
,Does he light you up like this? Does he make you laugh?
,-Nobody makes me laugh like this.
,-Good. Then admit it. Admit that you love me.
,Give me one kiss.
,-Oh, God.
,-That's all. One quick kiss.
,Just one kiss...could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.
,Besides, it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.
,Your respiration rate has doubled. You're putting out clouds of pheromones.
,-It's not fair to read me like that.
,-I know. Love isn't fair.
,I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you to follow it.

,Ladies and Gentlemen,
,I‘d planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.
,Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger.
,We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.
,Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground.
,But, we‘ve never lost an astronaut in flight. We‘ve never had a tragedy like this.
,And perhaps we‘ve forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle.
,But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.
,We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe.
,We mourn their loss as a nation together.
,For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy.
,But we feel the loss, and we‘re thinking about you so very much.
,Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, “Give me a challenge, and I‘ll meet it with joy.”
,They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.
,We‘ve grown used to wonders in this century.
,It‘s hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program has been doing just that.
,We‘ve grown used to the idea of space, and, perhaps we forget that we‘ve only just begun.
,We‘re still pioneers.
,They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
,And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle‘s take-off.
,I know it‘s hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen.
,It‘s all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
,It‘s all part of taking a chance and expanding man‘s horizons.
,The future doesn‘t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.
,The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we‘ll continue to follow them.
,I‘ve always had great faith in and respect for our space program.
,And what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don‘t hide our space program.
,We don‘t keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public.
,That‘s the way freedom is, and we wouldn‘t change it for a minute.
,We‘ll continue our quest in space.
,There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space.
,Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.
,I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA, or who worked on this mission and tell them:
, “Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.”
,There‘s a coincidence today.
,On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian later said,
,“He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.” Well, today, we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake‘s, complete.
,The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives.
,We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”
,Thank you.
,But why, some say, the moon
,Why choose this as our goal
,And they may well ask
,Why climb the highest mountain
,Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic
,Why does Rice play Texas
,We choose to go to the moon
,We choose to go to the moon
,We choose to go to the moon
,In this decade and do the other things
,Not because they are easy
,But because they are hard
,Because that goal will serve to organize
,And measure the best
,Of our energies and skills
,Because that challenge is one
,That we are willing to accept
,One we are unwilling to postpone
,And one which we intend to win
,And the others, too
,
,
,
,
,
,I believe we can keep the promise of our founders,
,the idea that if you're willing to work hard,
,it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from
,or what you look like or where you love.
,It doesn't matter whether you're black or white
,or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old
,or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight,
,you can make it here in America.

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time
,
,-You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life
,You know, like, like, I would always think,
,Uh, what if I make the wrong move?
,But maybe there isn't any right move
,You know? I mean, look at us
,You know, we all dress the same,
,We all talk the same,
,We all fuck the same,
,We all watch the same TV.
,Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different
,"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"
,And see, that's what makes me freak
,Because I can do anything I want,
,As long as I don't care about the result
,Anything is possible
,It is night on planet earth and I'm alive
,And someday I'll be dead
,Someday I'll just be bones in a box,

,And anything is possible

,Everything I touched ,I destroyed

,Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead
,And there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos,
,And they won't even know we were ever here
,And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones

,The end of the world.
,Take a piano.
,The keys begin, the keys end.
,You know there are 88 of them and no-one can tell you differently.
,They are not infinite, you are infinite.
,And on those 88 keys the music that you can make is infinite.
,I like that.
,That I can live by.
,But you get me up on that gangway
,and roll out a keyboard with millions of keys,
,and that's the truth, there's no end to them,
,that keyboard is infinite.
,But if that keyboard is infinite there's no music you can play.
,You're sitting on the wrong bench.
,That's God's piano.
,Christ, did you see the streets? There were thousands of them!
,How do you choose just one?
,One woman, one house,
,one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at,
,one way to die.
,All that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends.
,Aren't you scared of just breaking apart
,just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it?
,I was born on this ship.
,The world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time.
,And there were wishes here,
,but never more than could fit on a ship,
,between prow and stern.
,You played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite.
,I learned to live that way.
,Land
,is a ship too big for me.
,It's a woman too beautiful.
,It's a voyage too long. Perfume too strong.
,It's music I don't know how to make.
,I can't get off this ship.
,
,
,-...And I mean absolutely...Not a word to a soul.
,This is the only hope you have. Keep that in mind...always.
,And when you reappear, everything will be as it was before...
,As if you' d awakened from a horrible dream.
,Don' t you believe me?...
,Well, then, do just as you wish.
,
,-Jeanette, I only came in to tell you goodbye.
,-Goodbye?
,-It' s all over. You had your choice...
,Either me or this so-called profession you' re working at...
,You' re still working, so that means I' m through.
,-Oh, please don' t treat me like this, you know your ship is about to sail!
,-It' s better for us... it' s easier if I go away.
,-Easier to what? To suffer more than we have already?
,You know we belong with each other, Pierre!
,-Please Jeanette, let' s end this now.
,-No!
,I won' t do another number,I' m fed up with this job!
,Fed up with this job!
,
,-Few more days now...
,I could read the truth in the eyes of Professor Morette...
,There isn' t a bit of hope for me...I'm mutilated...disfigured......forever...!
,...I don' t want to be pitied by anyone!
,Especially by him...
,Oh, leave me alone...!
,Leave me alone!
,-She has no family here, not even friends close enough to worry about her...
,The newspapers made that clear.
,Go to her. Does anyone know you at that clinic?
,-No one.
,-And no one must know that Jeanette Moreneau is coming here.
,-No one will know.
,Alone.
,Alone.
,Alone.
,Alone.
,Alone.
,Alone.
,-And when you reappear, everything will be as it was before...
,As if you' d awakened from a horrible dream.
,A horrible dream.
,A horrible dream.

,I hold such bated breath
,My hand a brimming trove
,I hold such spinning wheel
,That my years gape wide.
,And I say yes, as true as Troilus.
,The moon having all to do with it, we wait and speak of nothing. I stare at your wealth as a moth would at a light. Our lies squeak like bus breaks on a boring hill.
,As False as Cressida you take my hand.
,I look into your eyes as into a foreign vowel, gathering my last words around me like photographs in a flood.
,I hold such bated breath
,My hand a brimming trove
,I hold such spinning wheel
,That my years gape wide.
,I could take this to you later
,But I take this to you now
,I must act quickly, you see,
,Before my mind invents a cold.
,Their love ran a faultless course, their eye trained on the same source, their hearts pregnant like salmon with millions of tiny hopes.
,Troilus: girl-shy but brash-hearted, on the cusp of full living.
,Cressida: bright-eyed but wary, bouncing on caution's weakest knee.
,And when she left, gutting the house of its contents as she went, a cold emptiness replaced the full feeling, leaving him as hollow-bloated as the deflating bulb of the stomach that remembers the child, love nursing us all into need.
,Blanking on the deep well of their love to bring up water, he waited nine days for her return, his patience a novena of noble longing.
,And I say yes, as true as Troilus.
,In privacy of heart
,I shuffle vagary
,And trick and the millions
,Suck at my bowels like mice.
,Like a boy Troilus begged for her return, rumors of her dissension like the cruel whisper of the winter wind hissing through the porch teeth. Nine days of wondering how the clock could summon up enough vim to muscle through the minutes. And on the tenth day something died, swelling like a tumor on the April path, ten days of sitting still, only to hear his heart break those ten times over.
,On the tenth day something died
,Swelling like a tumor the April path.
,Ten days of sitting still
,My body buckling like the belly of an accordion.
,And I stay true, as true as Troilus, and as I wait for you my life grows cold in waiting. Your truth sedated in the sleep-hub and your silence at the helm of our wreckage, I sit alone in my confusion, dwarfed in not knowing why, my heart like a brass instrument that is spittle-heavy, wheezing out.
,In the small font of a footnote, I beg for the tight screw, the green light, the hungry flutter of white hands at the blackening keys, to hammer out my own truth, weave a sharp confession, my knuckles chiming over the launch pad like church bells.
,That to be pianist
,And hunger at the keys
,In dreams airlifted out
,From where I toss alone in scrimmage.
,In dreams airlifted out, in dreams airlifted out, in dreams airlifted out from where I toss alone in scrimmage...
,I catalogue the moments of our beginnings
,Remembering how my body shifted like an easy tide
,As you pinned me to you.
,In these days of endless complaint,
,I raise my hand to cover my eye,
,As you did to yours, only to second,
,An open eye for yours, a heart for yours,
,A promise for yours, only to hold
,In jest, in dreams, in supplications,
,In jest.

,My name is Ruth Collins.
,I was married.
,I lost my husband.
,You are alone?
,You were married?
,Yes.
,Children?

,Don’t touch me
,You must be hungry, I’ll fix you some dinner
,Don’t touch me
,Don’t touch me
,What are you doing
,You know, you should eat.
,I can't.
,Don’t touch me
,Please, stop!
,Stop it, please!
,You, you are making me sick
,
,You are infected.
,No.
,You think I’m one of them
,You will be
,Don’t touch me
,Infected systems are allergic to garlic.
,
,Don’t touch me
,You've made up your mind just because I...
,You can't change the facts by talking.
,Facts? What facts?
,That I got sick?
,I've had a sensitive stomach all my life.
,I saw my husband killed.
,Torn to pieces, right in front of our house.
,I've been wandering ever since.
,Hiding at night.
,Not eating more than scraps.
,Sick with mourning, sick with fear, unable to sleep.
,Then you shout at me.
,
,You chase me across the field, hit me
,Drag me to this house, and to top it all
,When I get sick
,Because you shove a piece of reeking garlic in my face
,You tell me I'm infected.
,Where are you going?
,Let me go
,You can't go out there now. Let me go
,In a few minutes the streets will be full of them.
,Let me go...I don't care.
,At least let me give you a blood test
,
,And now 12 long hours before the sun will rise...
,And drive them back to darkness.

,Well, you know, so much of the time we're just lost
,We say, "Please, God, tell us what is right, tell us what is true"
,I mean, there is no justice
,The rich win, the poor are powerless
,We become tired of hearing people lie
,And after a time we become dead, a little dead
,We think of ourselves as victims, and we become victims
,We become, we become
,We become weak, we doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs, and we doubt the law
,But today you are the law
,The man growing childish in old age,
,he begs the very fleas
,to persuade the guard to change his mind and allow him to enter.
,His sight has dimmed,
,but in the darkness he perceives a radiance
,streaming immortally from the door of the Law.
,And now, before he dies,
,all he's experienced condenses into one question, a question he's never asked.
,He beckons to the guard.
,Says the guard, "You are insatiable! What is it now?"
,Says the man, "Every man strives to attain the Law.“
,How is it then that in all these years, no one else has ever come here, seeking admittance?"
,His hearing has failed, so the guard yells into his ear,
,"No one else but you could ever have obtained admittance!“
,No one else could enter this door!
,This door was intended only for you!
,
,You have to be something great somewhere
,You have to be
,And you just have to find it

,
,They say it's hard to fall in love,
,Maybe they never learned how to patiently wait.
,They say it's always dark before the dawn
,But you said goodbye before the dawn could break
,So who's really right in the end?
,When you tore down the walls
,but I'm the one alone in this bed?
,As you feel his hands around your waist
,I can feel them around my neck.
,God, this complacency has numbed me
,and this numbing has scared me back into the deep
,I'm slowly learning how to learn from something,
,and realizing the only thing worse than feeling pain
,is feeling nothing.
,There is an intoxication in her smile and it went straight to my head,
,Without it I can hardly see past the blurred lines that I've always been fed
,And sometimes I wonder, maybe my chest cavity is growing bigger,
,or maybe my heart is just sinking
,Either way we decorate this ship, it's still sinking.
,And I always had love to blame,
,And I always had love to blame,
,As I try to find my way, I feel this pain
,And I had love to blame.
,I had love to blame.
,If I were to believe in love,
,I would have to see a flood,
,But knowing my luck, I would somehow float to shore
,And have to wake up.
,I don't want to wake up,
,I don't want to wake up.
,'Cause I'm trying, just trying to find the light inside.
,So roll this stone away,
,I don't want to sleep another day.
,I just want to be in your presence,
,So please let me fade away.
,
,-Goddamn it, Andrew!
,If you're going to succeed at this thing...
,-What thing?
,-This...this thing you're trying to do...
,You've got to stop being so damn deferential.
,-I can't help being deferential. It's built-in.
,-Then change.
,-Change? I have changed.
,-I don't mean on the outside. Change on the inside.
,Take chances, make mistakes.
,-Mistakes?
,-Yes! Sometimes it's important not to be perfect, okay?
,It's important to do the wrong thing!
,-Do the wrong thing?
,-Yes.
,-Why? Oh I see. To learn from your mistakes.
,-No. To make them!
,To find out what's real and what's not, to find out what you feel.
,Human beings are terrible messes, Andrew.
,-I'll grant you that. I see.
,This is what is known as an irrational conversation, isn't it?
,-No, this is a human conversation.
,It's not about being rational. It's about following your heart.
,-And that's what I should do?
,-Yes. And you have a heart, Andrew. You do.
,I feel it. I don't even believe it sometimes, but I do feel it.
,-And in order to follow that heart... one must do the wrong thing.
,-Yes.
,-Thank you.
,
,-So you're not married yet?
,-No, two weeks from Saturday.
,-I'm not too late.
,Are you absolutely positive you're doing the right thing?
,-Positive?
,-About getting married?
,-I'm never absolutely positive about anything.
,-So you could be doing the wrong thing.
,-No, I'm pretty sure I'm doing the right thing.
,-Great.
,-Why is that great?
,-Well, in your apartment, you told me to do the wrong thing.
,Now, you are not doing the wrong thing. You're doing the right thing.
,It's safe to say you're not following your own advice.
,'Cause if you were, you would definitely not be marrying this man, Charles.
,-Because I would be doing the right thing.
,-Precisely.
,-In some strange way, you're starting to make sense.
,-Good.
,Do you have any idea what it's like to be in love with someone...who's about to marry someone else?
,Someone totally magnificent, someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun?
,Someone who you know is lying to herself?
,-Lying?
,-Convincingly, yeah. Very, very much so.
,-About what?
,-That you don't love me.
,When I know at least in some way you do.
,-And how do you know that?
,-Portia.
,I have done everything, inside and out.
,-But that stuff doesn't matter to me.
,-Well, something matters
,'Cause I'd have to believe if nothing mattered, you'd love me...
,And not some man whose chin could sink the Titanic.
,- What? See? It's true, isn't it?
,-Yeah.
,-I'm sorry.
,Does he light you up like this? Does he make you laugh?
,-Nobody makes me laugh like this.
,-Good. Then admit it. Admit that you love me.
,Give me one kiss.
,-Oh, God.
,-That's all. One quick kiss.
,Just one kiss...could not jeopardise a glorious marriage.
,Besides, it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute.
,Your respiration rate has doubled. You're putting out clouds of pheromones.
,-It's not fair to read me like that.
,-I know. Love isn't fair.
,I'm reading your heart. I'm asking you to follow it.
,Begging you.
,Begging is supposed to be humiliating. I don't care.
,I love you, Portia.
,I loved you the very first moment I saw you.
,
,- Can you talk where you are?
,- Yeah.
,- Who's there?
,- Satellite truck. No, I can talk.
,- Is anyone else there?
,- No.
,- Hang on.
,- Oh man.
,- You're really tired, I know, you sound just awful. I love you.
,- I love you too. I don't want to be here. I want to be with you.
,- I was sitting in bed.
,- Yeah.
,- And I was kind of day dreaming.
,- Mmhmm.
,- And I was remembering...umm...I don't know, I was just remembering all sorts of things.
,- Like what?
,- I was remembering when you came and saw me after the collection.
,- Yeah.
,- And you just walked in the door.
,- Yeah.
,- And dropped everything.
,Yeah.
,- I was just remembering that. I haven't thought about that for a long time.
,- Yeah.
,- And how amazing that was.
,- Yeah. Well...
,Can you talk where you are?
,- Yeah.
,- Who's there?
,- Satellite truck. No, I can talk.
,- I was sitting in bed.
,- Yeah.
,- And I was kind of day dreaming.
,- Mmhmm.
,- And I was remembering...umm...I don't know, I was just remembering all sorts of things.

,- Yeah.
,- And dropped everything.
,- Yeah.
,- I was just remembering that. I haven't thought about that for a long time.
,- Yeah.
,- And how amazing that was.
,- Yeah. Well...
,I love you.
,
,
,
,
,I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business.
,I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.
,I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white.
,We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.
,We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.
,We don't want to hate and despise one another.
,In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
,The way of life can be free and beautiful.
,But we have lost the way.
,Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate;
,has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
,We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in：
,machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
,Our knowledge has made us cynical，
,our cleverness hard and unkind.
,We think too much and feel too little:
,More than machinery we need humanity;
,More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.
,Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
,The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.
,The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all.
,Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world,
,millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
,To those who can hear me I say "Do not despair".
,The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress:
,the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people,
,will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish. . .
,Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you,
,who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel,
,who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, use you as cannon fodder.
,Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts.
,You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men.
,You have the love of humanity in your hearts.
,You don't hate, only the unloved hate.
,Only the unloved and the unnatural.
,Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.
,In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
,- "The kingdom of God is within man"
,Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men; in you, the people.
,You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.
,You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful,
,to make this life a wonderful adventure.
,Then in the name of democracy let's use that power, let us all unite.
,Ever hear, ever hear voices?
,Do you ever see in the newspaper the word ‘stop’ and stop exactly what you’re doing?
,Ever think, ever think it’s just too much, you know?
,Ever lose your memory?
,‘Lose your memory?!’
,

  (Matthew 4:16) The people who sat in darkness saw great light. 
 
 The average fellow the average girl that are afraid to be laughed at 
 You are afraid to be talked about
 You are afraid to be excluded from school
 Because you don't want to be laughed at.
 
 You know something, I hate you.
 
 (Jeremiah 17:9) 
 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?
 
 I have found out what God want you to do.
 And I sincerely hope that ??? 
 This high school will be a better high school.
 Thank you very much and God bless.
 
 You know something, I hate you. 

,I love you so much.
,But this is where I am now.
,And I need you to let me go.
,As much as I want to,
,I can't live in your book anymore.
,Where are you going?
,It would be hard to explain.
,But if you ever get there...
,come find me.
,Nothing will ever pull us apart.
,I've never loved anyone the way I love you.
,Me too.
,Now we know how.
,I sleep all the time when you’re not here, John.
,Sometimes 17 hours a day.
,I don’t see anybody, John.
,The days just pass by.
,You know… Training home sleep… Training.
,I don’t want to live anymore.
,You don’t want to live? anymore?
,Yes, but… Only together with you.

,I think that
,if the reigning powers
,had any great respect for good pictures
,or the people
,who could make them
,that this respect was probably very well
,tempered by the somewhat cynical observation
,that poor and mediocre pictures
,might just as well prove successful
,as their pictures of higher value.
,
,Television has changed this completely,
,and I think that
,despite the unhappy financial upheavel
,that it's caused in the movie industry
,it is also provided a very invigorating
,and stimulating challenge
,which has made it necessary for films
,to be made with more sincerity and more daring.
,to be made with more sincerity and more daring.
,
,If Hollywood lacks the color
,and excitement of its early days with Rolls-Royces
,and leopard-skin seat covers,
,I think on the other hand
,it provides the most exciting and stimulating atmosphere
,of opportunity and possibilities for young people today.
,
,but I can assure you now.
,very confidently that it's going to be all right again.
,I feel much better now.
,
,Look, Dave...I can see you're really upset about this...
,I honestly think you should sit down calmly...take a stress pill and think things over.
,I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...
,but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal.
,I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission...
,and I want to help you.

,After that just take my urn and fucking dump it on the pastor
,Interlude (Mitchell Bay)
,I used to be passive, so when I pass please
,Just grab a wrap and, roll me up and smoke me
,I'm talking bout' my ashes, Yeah just let me go off ..
,Verse 2 (Ruby Da Cherry)
,I'm from the Se7en, aint no heaven, in my destination
,** your breath and aiming for the lake
,I'm betting on how long it takes for me to sink below 
,I go so low, so low, aint got no hoe I know I'm dead 
,Cause when it's cold outside I see no breath 
,I know I'm dead 
,Because my neck is red from rigamortis 
,Settling, I'm settling down underneath the ground, inside the grave 
,I slick keep digging,
,yeah you never finished because death is eternal
,Bitch im Infernal, eternally determined 
,To MURDER MYSELF
,Verse 3 (Mitchell Bay)
,With the pain that I've engraved all up in my sub conscious
,From the self doubt among a couple other problems
,I make my way through the flames
,Unmasked like Kane, brimstones in my pocket 
,There ain't shit that you constructed 
,So the fuck down is where you can sit
,Ridin round with suicide 
,In the N.O. on that Voodoo tip 
,When I blow up I'm gonna cop a necklace that's doubles as a belt
,And when I murder myself
,Please play reservoir dogs at my celebration of life 
,I don't want a funeral I don't want no crying
,Tell my mama that I'm sorry
,This is not her fault 
,Remember when I spilt the apple juice in the hall
,Feeding what's eating at me
,I will feast until I starve
,Behaving self destructive
,Hip hop cracked my shell up open
,Unleashed my soul planted a third eye up on my fore
,Closing out the openings of stores
,When I go off, when I go off
,Feelin like Gorilla Zoe mixtape a month
,I get so lost when I'm in the booth, when I press record
,I just might say THANK YOU BASEDGOD
,On a song with $uicideboy$ oh my Lord
,Feelin evil lucid I might peel em like I'm Luca Magnotta
,Rockin Rothco with my papa Derek Deano, bumping Clams Casino
,Wrestling with my demons like Ricky The Dragon Steamboat
,MitcHy Man Savage Carlito
,I record on an Apple with a Hawaiian shirt on
,Rowdy Roddy Piper mixed with a rowdy mothafucka off the street
,I'm always spittin' one too many

,and incase you couldn’t tell
,i didn’t take it very well
,cos this life’s been killing me ever since it begun
,this days not any different from any other one
,feels pretty good but it doesn't feel right
,there's voices in my head but i just want quiet
,i need closure
,oh i need closure
,and every seconds just like the first
,I’ve learnt to like and love the hurt
,it gets closer
,oh it gets closer、closer
,woke up with a rope around my neck
,and i'd rather be dead
,than have you wrapped around my head

,Like a withered rose in the rain I'd fall apart
,Down to your feet again
,Pricked from all the thorns
,Your blood was the only thing feeding the garden
,Always seemed so carefree
,But, now you're gone I can't see
,Roses in the spring bloomed, everything died too soon
,Cut away all the pain
,You could never feel me
,You don't want to anyway
,I know I'd just hurt you
,I think about it everyday
,Love never lasts, even to your own
,It's never unconditional
,Devoured all your power, I am not a flower
,You're not my creator
,You're not my creator
,See we sunk in too soon
,Guided by the blue moon, drowning in the red sea

,I like a story I can see right through
,And I know you do that 'cause I do that too
,The feelings best when it's fleeting
,The memory is best when it's leaving
,What was it like when you lived back then?
,I wanna hear about some people that you never met
,I wanna stare up at the sun until I'm blind again
,Wake up in your arms again
,But I can't get a hold
,That's why you see me
,I'm so shook up
,God might forgive you but I don't
,No it's just something you know
,Black lights, got a suicide fever
,Think about the past, stop the weight upon the trigger
,When you get this old, man, you really start to figure
,Black lights, got a suicide fever
,When I cast stones in the past, stop the weight upon the trigger
,When you get this old, man, you really start to figure
,That I feel so small, what could I be doing wrong?
,I feel so small, what could I be doing wrong?
,
,-...And I mean absolutely...Not a word to a soul.
,This is the only hope you have. Keep that in mind...always.

,-Goodbye?
,-It' s all over. You had your choice...
,Either me or this so-called profession you' re working at...
,You' re still working, so that means I' m through.
,-Oh, please don' t treat me like this, you know your ship is about to sail!
,-It' s better for us... it' s easier if I go away.
,-Easier to what? To suffer more than we have already?
,You know we belong with each other, Pierre!
,-Please Jeanette, let' s end this now.
,-No!
,I won' t do another number,I' m fed up with this job!
,Fed up with this job!
,
,-Few more days now...
,I could read the truth in the eyes of Professor Morette...
,There isn' t a bit of hope for me...I'm mutilated...disfigured......forever...!
,...I don' t want to be pitied by anyone!
,Especially by him...
,Oh, leave me alone...!
,Leave me alone!
,-She has no family here, not even friends close enough to worry about her...

,Go to her. Does anyone know you at that clinic?

,but how many people lose their faith because heaven shows them too much
,
,
,And now I think my faith is weakening.
,And just as you bring me back, you push me from the ledge.
,
,That day, that was the end
,

,Today, I'm no longer ill
,
,You are my wings
,
,And I can sing, higher than clouds, clouds, clouds..

,Here`s the point
,If we consider the huge maze of possible universes
,The vast majority will not have conditions hospitable to life
,Or at least to anything remotely akin to life as we know it
,For drastic changes in familiar physics
,This is clear
,If our universe didn`t conform to the rules it does
,life, as we know it, would not exist
,Even rather conservative changes to physics would interfere with the formation of stars
,For example
,Disrupting their ability to act as cosmic furnaces
,That synthesize complex life-supporting atoms
,Such as carbon and oxygen
,That normally are spewed throughout the universe
,By supernova explosions
,In the light of the sensitive dependence of life on the details of physics
,If we now ask, for instance
,Why the forces and particles of nature have the particular properties we observe
,A possible answer emerges
,Across the entire gamut of possibilities
,These features vary widely
,Properties could be different
,What`s special about the particular combination of particle and force properties we observe
,Is that clearly they allow life to form
,And life, intelligent life in particular
,Is a prerequisite even to ask the question of why our universe
,Has the properties it does
,In plain language
,Things are the way they are
,Because if they weren`t
,We wouldn`t be here to notice
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see
,The lack of politics and factories
,The gods at stake
,The myopic view
,Halts suspicion that it just might be true
,Your sense of awe
,Your sense of wonder
,Remains intact in the face of it all
,Perhaps in time
,Someone will listen to this waste of breath
,This lecture on nothing
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see
,The lack of politics and factories
,The gods at stake
,The myopic view
,Halts suspicion that it just might be true
,Your sense of awe
,Your sense of wonder

,I don't love you anymore.
,Since when?
,Now. Just now. I don‘t want to lie.
,Can't tell the truth, so it's over.
,It doesn't matter. I love you. None of it matters.
,Too late. I don't love you anymore. Goodbye.
,Here's the truth, so now you can hate me.
,Larry fucked me all night.
,I enjoyed it. I came.
,I prefer you. Now go.
,I knew that. He told me.
,You knew?
,I needed to hear it from you.
,Why?
,Because he might have been lying. I had to hear it from you.
,I would never have told you,
,Because I know you would have never forgived me.
,I would. I have.
,Why did he tell you?
,Because he's a bastard.
,How could he?
,Because he wanted this to happen.
,But why test me?
,Because I'm an idiot.
,Yes. I would have loved you... forever. Now, please go.
,Don't do this, Alice. Please, talk to me.
,I am talking. Fuck off.
,I'm sorry. You misunderstand! I didn't mean to.
,Yes you did.
,I love you!
,Where?
,What?
,Show me! Where is this love?
,I... I can't see it, I can't touch it.
,I can't feel it. I can hear it. I can hear some words,
,But I can't do anything with your easy words.
,Whatever you say is too late.
,Please, don't do this!
,Done.
,Now, please go, or I'll call security.
,No, you're not in a strip club, there is no security.
,Why did you fuck him?
,I wanted to.
,Why?!
,I desired him.
,Why?!
,You weren't there!
,Why him?!
,He asked me nicely.
,You're a liar.
,So?
,Who are you?
,I'm no one!
,
,I'm not any more idealistic than anyone else.
,I don't go around saying that human beings are going to love each other so much that they're going to set up a utopia.
,No, what I'm saying is if human beings have any sanity,
,enough sanity to fear the consequences of not doing it,
,and enough sanity to hope for the consequences of doing it,
,then they will do it.
,But I can't guarantee that the human species will be sane.
,And if they are not,
,then we will probably destroy ourselves.
,And who is going to fight that?
,
,
,
,
,
,Well, you know, so much of the time we're just lost
,We say, "Please, God, tell us what is right, tell us what is true"
,I mean, there is no justice
,The rich win, the poor are powerless
,We become tired of hearing people lie
,And after a time we become dead, a little dead
,We think of ourselves as victims, and we become victims
,We become, we become
,We become weak, we doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs, and we doubt the law
,But today you are the law
,Lauren, wait. Hey, wait. Lauren.
,“Oh my god.
,Get in the car.
,“No!”
,Lauren, don’t walk- Hey!
,I really did try to kill myself!
,Just before I faked it.
,“Wow. Shawn it’s over.”
,No it’s not!
,“Ya it is. I’m in love with somebody else.”
,“Who?”
,“My old boyfriend Victor,
,and that’s none of your fuckin’  business, actually!”
,(scornful laugh) What? Fuckin’ Victor?“Ya.”
,What... the fuck are you write me letters?
,“Wow. Deal with it Shawn. It’s over. Rock n’ roll.”
,Lauren, I wanna know you.
,“What does that mean? Know me. Know me.
,Nobody knows anyone else, ever!”
