This is the happy house-we're happy here in the happy house oh it's such fun
We've come to play in the happy house
And waste a day in the happy house-it never rains
We've come to scream in the happy house we're in a dream in the happy house
We're all quite sane
This is the happy house-we're happy here there's room for you if you say i do
But don't say no or you'll have to go
We've done no wrong with our blinkers on it's safe and calm if you sing along
This is the happy house-we're happy here in the happy house. to forget ourselves-and pretend all's well there is no hell. 

Stop me, oh oh-oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh oh-oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
â€~Cause nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop, I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder, yeah
Who said lied I'd to her?
Who said I'd lied? â€~Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
Broke my knee and broke my spleen
And then he really laid into me, yeah
Friday night in Out-Patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Who said I'd lied? â€~Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied to her?
So I drank one, it became four
And when I fell on the floor I drank more
Stop me, oh oh-oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh I said, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
â€~Cause nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
Set me free, why don't you?
Get out my life, why don't you?
â€~Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on
Set me free, why don't you girl?
Get out my life, why don't you baby?
â€~Cause you don't really love me, no no no
You just keep my hanging on

,蟑螂在旁好心 的加油
,发现我 适合在 梦中的生活
,壁上有只壁虎 在漫步
,四只脚的速度 突然之间觉得实在是酷
,在一栋旧的仓库 没人的空屋
,有只壁虎懒洋洋的 在漫步
,但他吃起蚊子的动作 很迅速
,像我们精准舞步
,分不清 是打招呼还是在梦游
,在跳舞 我们这支舞的名字是叫壁虎在漫步
,但GIRL不像蚊子傻呼呼舌头 一伸就抓住

,喜欢跟冲动有时难分辨
,想要冒险 靠近一点
,别人的动作比我先
,就站在我的面前 然后将你的手牵
,时间 没站在我这边
,不过也才有一瞬间
,拍拍尘土准备 要上路
,我就是 停不住
,我们帅性跳舞 叫壁虎漫步
,对那地板有礼貌 是我们壁虎一族
,最基本的态度
,就算你穿上二手的牛仔裤
,你还是要有那种一流的技术
,完美演出
,不是手脚在忙碌
,辛苦就是酷 绝对是错误

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'
Til I'm free fallin
I live for the nights

I am tryna holla got that ink up on my colla'
Drinkin til it's nada, isn't whiskey I don't bother
My bitches ain't no dimes they be mothafuckin' dollars
So we stack our drinks up high, skyscrappin' til we taller
Ring ring hit that up show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood dance until you get enough
Ring ring hit that up show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood dance until you get enough 

Imma do what I want, whatever
Imma rage til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night 
Free fallin'

I'm a grim reaper when I'm blarin' out your speaker 
Killin' out the weaker welcome to the final feature
My head is in the clouds, you can say that I'm a dreamer 
But I bang it super loud turn that bitch into a screamer

Imma do what I want, whatever
Imma rage til the dawn, all nighter
Don't hold your breath you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'

I live for the night
I live for the lights 
I live for the high til I'm free fallin' 
I live for the night
I live for the lights
I live for the high til I'm free fallin'

,I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
,I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
,I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
,They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
,I didn't know that I could get this low
,
,And I, and I don't know where to go
,And I, and I, know, know
,And I, and I don't know where to go
,And I don't know where to go
,And I don't know where to go
,
,I see a dark reflection in my dashboard
,Don't even know where I'm driving to anymore
,I think about us back together someday
,What you doing this Sunday
,I needed space so I left home
,But now I'm desperate for the things I know
,Like how you made me laugh on a bad day
,
,I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
,I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
,I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
,They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
,I didn't know that I could get this low
,
,And I don't know where to go
,
,Promises promises, year after year on my knees
,Paradise knocks for my future, just have to believe
,Flood flood flood in the streets so they said
,Blood blood blood in the streets of my head
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you
,
,Just listen to Father and he’ll set you up to suc-seeds
,In the soil to dry to produce what we
,Need for our family trees
,Cutting down to our knees
,We look up to the sky to retell the old
,Stories of glorious, battles victorious
,Brothers notorious, empires turn to dust
,Men turned delirious, reasons mysterious
,Destruction comes near to us, our mothers shed tears for us
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you
,
,Lived on my knees
,They told me that you’d set me free
,We lost our years together because of the fear
,Know i’m never gonna make it there
,I just wanted Eden on repeated sunny days
,The land below me cracks and tears
,Look into the sky through the thick and rainy haze
,
,Do you believe in me
,Do you believe in me
,We believed in you
,We believed in you

,Pounding out of rhythm through the air
,Empty bottles left to tryin' it out

,Then I close my eyes, off my day,
,You want conflict to broken, when you gotta someone:

,Think you did the demolition, that's a definition
,What you did, yeah?

,When I met you in the summer

,Somewhere I lost a piece of me
,Smoking cigarettes on balconies
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side
,So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
,I'll be there for you
,I'll be there for you
,When you're screaming but they only hear you whisper
,I'll be loud for you
,But you gotta be there for me too
,But you gotta be there for me too
,Last year took a toll on me
,But I made it with you next to me
,Around the world and back again
,I hope you're waiting at the end
,But I can't do this alone
,Sometimes I just need a light
,If I call you on the phone
,And you're on the other side

,But you gotta be there for me too
,But I'm holding on to something
,Wake up if you feel nothing
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,There was a time that I was sober
,What I got to do to show you
,I'm running running just to keep my hands on you
,Running running just to keep my hands on you

,We were all lost
,Almost something so close
,On the outlines of your west coast
,We were waving red balloons
,We were wide-eyed
,Oh, we only lived in highlights
,A delusion, some were twilight
,We were dumb and beautiful
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,And no one else would ever do
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you
,That's something that I can't refuse
,It's something that I didn't choose
,I only wanna be

,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you
,We were perish
,We were subtle, we were drastic
,We were calm, we were dramatic
,We were fantasy and fear
,And you changed me
,You were sunny and you faced me
,Yeah, you saw me and encouraged me
,Like a tourist, souvenir (woah)
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew
,I only wanna be with you

,Mama said don’t lose your head
,or forget where you’re from
,I swore when I got older,
,gonna leave this place behind
,I ain’t never looking back
,and I never changed my mind
,I never knew the world would be so cold
,Now all I want to do is find my way home
,No place like home
,No place like home
,No place like
,
,I’m not afraid of losing
,and I’m not afraid to fall
,I’m always taking chances,
,I’m down to risk it all
,I’m really far from perfect,
,so take me as I am
,I’m may be bruised and broken
,but I don’t give a damn

,Now all I want to do is find my way home

,We were both young when I first saw you.
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
,I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
,See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
,See you make your way through the crowd
,And say, "Hello."
,Little did I know...
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes,
,Escape this town for a little while.
,Oh, oh.
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
,But you were everything to me,
,I was begging you, "Please don't go."
,And I said...
,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
,I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
,Romeo, save me.
,They're trying to tell me how to feel.
,This love is difficult but it's real.
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
,It's a love story, baby, just say...

,Watch the darkness turn the light
,It likes moon glows
,I know that I won't sleep tonight
,Cos there's fire in my heart
,And I don't know where it start
,I'm searching where I know
,And if I had crystal ball
,Would wanna know it all
,The mysteries had the show
,Because of this midnight
,And I dreaming while awake

,And I dreaming while awake
,My body so tired
,But my mind won't let me sleep
,Getting higher and higher
,And less plausibility
,Cos I can feel it in my bones
,I can winning take throw
,There's nobody else want more
,I don't need to have control
,Got feeling in my soul
,Don't kown why my life is get stoned

,Одинокий странник потерял свою дорогу
,Время потеряло часовые пояса
,Сердце так измучено веретеном пороков
,И где-то вдалеке далёко ждёт его она:
,Чистая, не раз не тронута руками грязными -
,Девушка, чьё сердце в двери не пускала зла
,Злые врали страннику, что с ней не станет счастлив он
,Но он упрямо верил, что найдёт покой в её глазах
,
,И снова новый рассвет перебьёт сон
,Ноги снова пойдут в путь, несмотря на боль
,Солнечный пик засветит в небе, бросив намёк
,Чтобы помочь тебя найти мне...
,И снова новый рассвет перебьёт сон
,Ноги снова пойдут в путь, несмотря на боль
,Чтобы почувствовать рук твоих тепло -
,Хочу найти тебя - Медина
,Хочу найти тебя - Медина. Хочу найти тебя - Медина
,Хочу найти тебя - Медина. Хочу найти тебя - Медина
,Хочу найти тебя - Медина. Хочу найти тебя - Медина
,Хочу найти тебя - Медина. Хочу найти тебя - Медина
,
,Одинокий странник потерял свою дорогу
,И кажется, что цель его всё так же далека
,Корабль в его разуме качает непогода
,Но маятник в душе ему укажет берега
,Пытаясь сделать все его усилия напрасными -
,Жизнь раскидала их по разным полюсам
,Их судьбы были связаны законами негласными
,И он упрямо верит, что найдёт покой в её глазах

,我就说
,你晓得撒
,不要
,在美好的一天里空等
,在整日浮沉里空等，找不到点乐子
,我只想说
,我们将我们要
,我们应该嗨起来啊
,和兄弟们出去玩
,小妞们一个个都神色飞舞
,我们唯一要做的就是把今天浪过去
,heyy我们将放纵一天
,没人会悲伤哭泣
,又没人快死了
,把你的烦恼都抛诸脑后吧
,heyy今天就只管畅快玩
,剪个新发型
,喷点古龙香水
,换个手机壳颜色感觉还不错
,橙味酷爱一直很受欢迎
,我的手机铃声还是那个“哦不兄弟别这样”
,在免费洗车点连道奇都得洗干净
,当我能重叱风云时我就回来
,教民们炸了鱼
,配着芥末辣椒酱、白面包还有炸薯条
,虔心信奉着上帝
,去公园晃荡
,看男孩们大秀街舞舞技
,音响里放着nappy roots来打节拍
,昨晚我中了pick3的奖
,买了几双空军一号
,我们将要嘿
,4件高领T恤哦天呐我爱死BG（某牌子）了
,我们要放纵一天
,和兄弟们出去玩
,小妞们一个个都神色飞舞
,我们今天就是要怎么开心怎么过
,heyy我们会玩得贼开心
,没人会悲伤哭泣
,又没人快死了

,heyy今天就只管畅快玩
,我才不管那些无名之辈说什么
,我还活着
,我就得为之祈祷
,车洗好了准备浪了
,打电话告诉兄弟们我来了
,听到电话那头老表在做饭
,待会儿我得好好尝尝
,穿着市面上还买不到的新装嘚瑟
,但要是没人问起哪还有啥意思
,哎今天还是挺操蛋的
,这些大波霸非让我呆在这里
,极度难熬
,戴上墨镜露齿笑
,笑得有点猥琐但我绝比是好人
,整个街区都充满了爱爱爱，所以我感觉我人还可以
,heyy我们要放纵一天

,我们也许可以照孩子们说的那样
,去公园放松一天
,整点烧烤小吸一口，举起双手摇起来
,如果闹矛盾了，和气生财
,别管那些继续嗨
,也是该换条路走了
,这样才能空出时间
,陪陪孩子给他们创造一个更好的环境
,最好的话
,解散你的帮派找个稳定的事做吧
,如果你要继续干脏活
,就得手脚麻利会飞叶子....（嘘）
,但你要想做大事就得像个正真的玩家敢于冒险
,不如享受每一天
,代表整个街区
,世界都是你的
,但我们始终是一条船上的
,所以你怎么选择都OK
,heyy我们今天先畅快玩

,От звона монет, дым сигарет.
,Есть сказочный мир, за окнами мы.
,От слова терпеть я сжал кулаки.
,Есть я и есть мы.
,За окнами мир, где мы влюблены.
,Половина моя, половина твоя.
,Я себя не делю, все что любишь на два.
,Это трудно было принять.
,Это трудно было простить.
,Но без капли твоей любви.
,Упал на землю камнем без сил.
,Водопадами, удары МиМиМи.

,Моно или стерео судьбы когда ты один, а вас два, дотла.
,И если тело умрет раньше половины.
,Я продолжу жить в самом прямом смысле.
,Моя душа в ее сердце, в серидине.
,Память в поступках, плоть просто кейсы.

,And I can't keep a girl, no

,Only hate the road when you’re missin’ home
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Staring at the bottom of your glass
,Hoping one day you’ll make a dream last
,But dreams come slow and they go so fast
,You see her when you close your eyes
,Maybe one day you’ll understand why
,Everything you touch surely dies
,But you only need the light when it’s burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

 When it comes around again it's not too clear
 You say yes, they say no,
 Everybody's talking everywhere you go
You try to give another man a helping hand
 He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
 Never do to others what they do to you
 Try to find another way to make it through
What I say is what I know,
 Try to get a favour going from door to door
 You stop and pray it's out of style,
 You get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles

In a minute, darling, coming for us
FOR US
Summertime with no returning
TURNING
I don't wanna be that prisoner
I don't wanna get caught up again
Take me down and I'll keep breaking out
AND OUT
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
There's a man who's got something for you
FOR YOU
Come around and all your secrets
SECRETS
Trigger my things you need to heal
Holding on to broken souvenirs
Pull at strangers who start to reaper
APPEAR
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
Waken up to no one
Taking all the floor
Wishing I'm holding
Here on the floor
Waken up to no one
Taking all the floor
Wishing I'm holding
Here on the floor

Fill the groove
Into something

On the run

Peace will come
This world will rest
Once we have
Togetherness
Day or night

That's the scene
You gotta do your thing
You gotta do your thing
Day or night
Black or white
Oh we had fun

It's just begun
It's just begun

,Nu rezist
,Respir un aer mult prea trist
,Si raze-n gand m-au mai atins
,De cand, nu mai esti cu mine
,Eu tot mai visez
,Cum in brate-mi adormi
,Si ne-atingem in somn
,Pe umarul tau sunt lacrimi de inger
,De ce nu esti aici
,Sami spui cu un sarut
,Ca ma iubesti prea mult
,Sa plangem impreuna
,De ce nu esti aici
,Cand cerul m-a uitat
,Si printre nori eu cad
,Tu sa ma prinzi de mana

,Cand nu, nu sunt langa tine

,Se nota en tu mirada que él no te quiere

,Y no te vas, tu no te vas
,Yo sé que tu no entiendes
,Pero él me jura que va a cambiar
,No sé que hacer, ni a quien amar
,Él nunca va a tratarte mejor
,Mientras yo estoy loco de amor
,Él te negó un beso y te doy mucho más que eso
,Sabes que me muero por ti cada vez que me hablas así

,Y cuando tu me miras mi corazón explota
,En el amor es nuevo e a veces se equivoca
,Por ti yo estoy loca
,Contigo yo me he vuelto loco, loco
,Supiste enamorarme sin querer poco a poco
,Y aunque no tengas dueño yo también me equivoco

,Widespread reports of the infectious X-Virus are pouring in as people around the world are beginning to panic
,Medical experts have informed us that alterations of human DNA has led to the creation of an entirely new type of virus
,This X-Virus is somehow able to spread through sound waves
,Rearranging and permanently modifying humans on a cellular level
,By creating auditory and visual hallucinations
,It starts with seemingly random changes in pitch until slowly the infected begin to loose the ability to understand language

,你爱过一个人吗
,你知道爱一个人什么滋味吗
,我今天就告诉你
,爱一个人很累很累
,你做的每件事都想讨他的欢心
,但是他根本不领情
,你会被他的若即若离而受折磨
,你会因为他跟别人的亲密而吃醋
,晚上你会因为思念和心痛睡不着觉
,一想到他眼泪就止不住的流下来
,就是因为这么一个人
,你突然发现
,你把身体里的自己已经掏空了
,那个时候你才明白
,你付出的所有感情在他看来根本就一文不值

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,
,得意げに呟いた 心配ないからと
,人の少ないホームで ヘタクソに強がった
,唐突に鳴り響く 僕を呼ぶ別れの音
,見慣れたその泣き顔も しばらくは見れないね
,
,声が遮られていく 身振り手振りで伝える
,「いってらっしゃい」のサイン
,
,少しずつ小さくなってく 全部置いたまま
,悲しくなんかないさと イヤホンで閉じ込めたよ
,
,見えたんだぼんやりと 暖かい昨日のビジョン
,右と左に広がって 僕を連れて行くのさ
,
,僕の横をすり抜けて 遠ざかっていく景色
,あの日の僕を置いてく
,
,こぼれた涙一滴（ひとしずく）の 意味も分からずに
,タイムマシンにゆられて 明日も元気でいるよ
,
,こぼれた涙一滴（ひとしずく）の 意味も分からずに
,タイムマシンにゆられて 明日も元気で
,溢れる涙抑え切れず 意味も分からずに
,タイムマシンにゆられて また戻ってくるよ
,
,待ち合わせは2時間前で
,此処に独り それが答えでしょ
,街ゆく人 流れる雲
,僕のことを嘲笑ってた
,それは簡単で とても困難で
,認めることで前に進めるのに
,信じられなくて 信じたくなくて
,君の中できっと僕は道化師なんでしょ
,回って 回って 回り疲れて
,息が 息が切れたの
,そう これが悲しい僕の末路だ
,君に辿り着けないままで
,僕を乗せて地球は回る
,何も知らない顔して回る
,1秒だけ呼吸を止めて
,何も言えず立ちすくむ僕
,それは偶然で そして運命で
,知らないほうが良いと知ってたのに
,触れてしまったの 君の温もりに
,その笑顔で その仕草で
,僕が壊れてしまうから
,回って 回って 回り疲れて
,回って 回って 回り疲れて
,息が 息が 息が止まるの
,息が 息が 息が止まるの
,変わって 変わって 変わってゆくのが
,怖い 怖いだけなの
,もうやめた ここで君を待つのは
,僕が壊れてしまうだけだ
,回って 回って 回り疲れて
,息が 息が止まるの
,そう 僕は君が望むピエロだ
,君が思うままに 操ってよ

,君は変な声で　奇妙な見た目で
,時に気持ち悪いと言われてきた
,でも　心臓が動いてないから
,傷くことはなかった
,第一印象はマイナス　変化してったバイアス
,流れ流れて　月日は経ち
,まだ　こんな歌を作っていた
,こんにちは　はじめまして
,さようなら　またあした
,変わらぬ愛も　儚い恋も
,君からすれば　ただの記号で
,正義も悪も　帰らぬ日々も
,君の前では　どうでもよくて
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,今日も
,君は変な声で　奇妙な見た目で
,時に　素晴らしいと持て囃された
,でも　感情がわからないから
,喜び方も　手のぬくもりも知らなかった
,知らなかった　知らなかった
,知らなかったはずなのに
,巡り巡って　たどり着いた
,想像もしていなかった未来
,ひさしぶり　ごめんなさい
,おめでとう　おげんきで
,楽し夜も　虚しい朝も
,君からすれば　ただの記録で
,破れた夢も　心の傷も
,景色のように　ただ　すり抜けて
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,今日も
,変わらぬ愛も　儚い恋も
,君からすれば　ただの記号で
,正義も悪も　帰らぬ日々も
,君の前では　どうでもよくて
,ここにいること　いなくなること
,君からすれば　不思議じゃなくて
,この世の果ても　命の謎も
,君の前では　どうでもよくて
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,ずっと　ずっと
,君が生きてなくてよかった
,くだらない　理想じゃない
,非日常のゴミ溜めで
,ぼんやり　君は歌ってて
,未来が楽しいか　わからないけれど
,もう少しここにいさせて
,悲しみの海に沈んだ私
,目を開けるのも億劫
,このままどこまでも堕ちて行き
,誰にも見つけられないのかな
,どこへ向かい、何をすれば
,ふと射し込む一筋の光
,手を伸ばせば届きそうだけど
,波に拐(さら)われて見失った
,あれは一体なんだったのかな
,あたたかくて眩しかったの
,無意識のカウンターイルミネーション
,嘘つきは誰？
,深海少女 まだまだ沈む
,暗闇の彼方へ閉じこもる
,深海少女 だけど知りたい
,心惹かれるあの人を見つけたから
,昼も夜も無かったこの場所
,なのに眠れない夜は続く
,自由の羽大きく広げて
,泳ぐあなたは綺麗でした
,そしてまた光は降りそそぐ
,見とれていたら目が合った
,気付いてこっちを振り返るあなたに
,嘘つきな私…
,深海少女 わざわざ沈む
,暗闇のさなかに赤い頬
,深海少女 ハダカの心を見せる勇気
,黒い海がまだ許さない
,こんなに服は汚れてしまった
,笑顔も醜くゆがんでいった
,誰にも合わせる顔なんて無いの
,もう放っておいてよ
,声にならない気持ちが溢れてとけた
,次の瞬間、君が突然姿を消した
,心配性の 彼女は焦る
,闇が彼を隠しひとりきり
,限界少女 その手を伸ばす
,ほらね、君も素敵な色を隠してた
,深海少女 腕を引かれる
,歌う祝福のマリンスノー
,深海少女 もっと知りたい
,心惹かれるあの人を見つけたから
,この海を出て 今飛び立つの

Verse one：
I wake up to another day of life and wish i didnt
Cuz my records predicted a future of bill clinton
But i continue to do my thang to make a livin
Fuck the police and judge brennan cuz i aint givin in
I'm cops so say the notorious killa
Last seen in the hilla in a black vigga
Smokin' lye with an unidentified man
The feds believe it was a member of the clan
A wild nigga so jiggy better be cautious
Fuck wit delores im bringin 50 crime bosses
From bk to jersey niggaz wanna murder me
Aint nuttin sweet kid they bettah bring their whole army
Fake ass gangstaz pretend to be killaz
End the drama with a slug from the 4-5th for real uh
1 - makin green for the next man
Money ?strugglin plans for the dividends
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
(repeat)
Verse two:
Same shit different day i scheme to make the paper
God dreams of livin large makin niggaz steal and rob
Fuck the pleadin ill leave ya bleedin
If ya take to long deliverin
Dividends, see nigga, im menances like 8 sharp
Cracks on my moms china plate
Bag 'em up and wait till it gets late and hit the gate
Keep my eyes open cuz po po they be keepin
They tryin to get locked on friday and spend the weekend
Then on ruckus island adolescents be watchin
So when im in the four buildin im hollerin staten island
With my ? in my hand like a 4-5th
The first nigga to fake a move is gettin phillied with the quickness
I'm hip to this wild ass game called street life
It's a cut throat bi with mens who live trife
You squig you my nigga (no doubt to the death)
I got the isle in my right hand so son part in the left
And let's go to war i got a tech and nine and 3 3-80's
Straight from haiti, ill turn a nigga into gravy
And fuck the media ? ? put this on the news
Cause its so safe to know the notorious rulz
Repeat 1
(fade)

,Turn my mic up
,Turn my mic up
,(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
,(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down nigga

,(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout niggas!
,Oh my lord, lower the casket down
,Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow!

,Grounds zero, shapiro the king cash cow
,Do I make 'em say 'Wow!', strip, ow, bow

,When I pop off I never stop, cause
,When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
,The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lockjaws
,No need to cook up the coke, you see me cop raw
,And if you ain’t have enough
,What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal Fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
,Back with the B.A barrackus callous
,bang on another song I’mma have these niggas nervous
,And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
,Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
,Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
,And I shit on these males ‘til it's stinkin' fouler than a weed smell
,Nigga your tree fell
,See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming a email
,Talking, I’m sick and I got them shook and I bang em at retail
,Until they cripple, see I cook like I’m slanging a weed sale
,Until I triple bread and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
,Oh see well, these niggas already know
,The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
,The case is shut
,Your bitch remind me of my replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
,It's going down like she was a basement fuck
,Swell up this shit like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
,So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
,Ragdolling these niggas and attack them like apes in the cut
,I’m waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet
,fuck
,It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
,And drinking ‘til I’m blasted harassing
,and erase a nigga (crunk) keeping 'em over
,Keeping 'em up and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
,I got ‘em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck
,While I’m chasing a buck these funny niggas be chasing they luck
,I be lacing them up like boots
,when I’m pushing they face in the mud (ahh)
,Missiles I fling while I spit live wire
,‘Til this shit circling back around
,With more fire for me to melt the break a brick surfacing back a sound
,While I'm lighting up shit that'll cause quick
,Worship and gatheraround, it's
,Certain this shit'll splatter cliques painful and make ‘em scatter
,Shameful the way I shatter, split shit apart, it doesn't matter (rip)
,Your head up off your shoulders (with) bullets bigger than a boulder
,And they break ‘em and they know us, classic
,And the way it’s going you could easily get your ass kicked
,See, me and Shady together we’re crazy
,Like baking a vomit and a rabies cake like a pastry bitch
,(We that sick)
,Like I'm from Haiti, I’m suggesting you pay me
,Don’t make me wanna spazz (Alalala)
,Like I’m a crazy Israeli, bastards
,While I bite the beat up and I'm starting to heat up, yack
,I’m chopping your foot off, now it’s mine
,And I’m putting my feet up, black
,Back to the hood and off to the wild
,And I’m hoping you protect your child
,And I been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
,Naw, but the beat is fried!
,Apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
,It just might make you sick
,So irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
,Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit
,Narrow minded, but go through such a wide range of this emotion
,That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
,I just pulled up in Clive Davis' driveway
,With his personal memoir saying he's bi
,Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
,Making him cry "rape" then arrive naked
,And drive straight through the gay pride parade, yippee-Ki-Yay
,Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
,And should I take it as a sign?
,Maybe to take 'em back into time (Shady)
,I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger
,To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
,Changed the whole complexion of the game
,But just in case you was thinking
,An inkling of replacing the kingpin
,Of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
,So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
,You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
,Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
,That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen and
,Who raps nasally, eyes hazelly, rhymes crazily
,But sounds like he may need some Flonase when he's speaking?
,What kind of stupid question is that?
,Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln
,Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
,How'd you think that play was this weekend?
,You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
,See me on a ballot? I'm running for class clown
,Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just a candidate
,To come fuck up the whole party
,Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
,To have every campus on a fucking rampage
,Act my goddamn age? I am eight
,So let's get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed
,covered in Band-Aids
,Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades
,But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
,Shady for president, ho
,Don't make me go take it back to the days of old
,Where Sway & Tech radio when I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
,I almost fell asleep on the wake up show
,Fuck you telling me, fools?
,I was rippin' shop raisin' hell up in Drew's
,When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
,Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
,You're fucking with vets dawg, fucking internet bloggers
,"I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
,Everything, I'm an expert on everything
,everything sucks, play the next song"
,Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
,With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you
,I'd be dead wrong
,Son of God I'm the S.O.G. like a wet log
,pores never get clogged
,I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
,Yes, yes y’all, steady on the left, y’all
,Step off 'forr you get stepped on, soft?
,Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
,Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
,I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
,Alert, alert, girl, alert
,Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt, so
,Jump around, jump, jump, get that ass shaking
,Jump around, jump, came to hit you with a fan favorite
,But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
,and freaking hands flailing
,And jump like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind
,More afraid of success than I am of failure
,So what does that tell ya?
,That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
,Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
,Before he ran straight into the damn railing
,Chill, man, chill
,Check The Annotated Cover Art Here!
,
,
,
,
,
,Why is that?Why is that?(Tell me why)
,I wasn't sleepin' I was creepin' slidin', hidin'
,I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
,Mentally sinkin' 'specially brinkin'
,Two decades and a half making a path for mine to follow
,The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap, prepared to gamble
,I give you half of chiseled pencil
,What's the come up, cried a ton of tears, drunk a ton of beers
,That's fun at first but learned in person fear throughout the years
,Kept my ears open, eyes scoping, mouth locked
,Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
,Nobody may not be there with the limb to limb
,This is the end, still I can't explain the fact
,Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?
,Baby, tell me why it's gotta be like that
,Know what, I said it
,Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
,That they need to be beheaded, why?
,I'm readily, steadily stimulate and then mutilate
,And all sloppily, copied imitations
,Cause they irritatin' so I'm intimidatin' them
,Over the snare with simply a stare
,Bringin' them turbulent terror
,And they know this 'cause they can feel it
,He knew that it was mine
,Still the sucker tried to steal it
,So I had to reveal it, through provin'
,That I am a star machine and fly
,And by just blinkin' my eye in a flash
,I flush out the face, layin' low-key
,Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
,Mister sometime-homey, why he act like that
,I thought he had my back, I thought he had our backs
,But it was him who I should've never trusted
,And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
,Or mouth busted for acting all dusted
,But bust this now when I'm out
,I seek and thought out the whole scene
,For all sinister's types, sneak that scheme
,They come into my face
,I send them tightmen home
,When they're sufferin'
,From the double agent syndrome, why?
,Why it gotta be like that
,Baby, tell me why it's gotta be like that
,Sometimes this world means everything to me
,The inside is lovely to these eyes I see
,And sometimes in my mind all I wanna do is cry
,Holly off, seven of them drops from my eye
,Thugs drain out my skin 'cause I'm pissed from within
,I see a situation now and all I do is grin
,People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelin'
,Agin' in short times 'cause life's a unravelin'
,While I'm straddlin' more's up this fuckin' mike
,I hate to be a pilot, crashin' in a flight
,People need to know about this thing called life
,'Cause if you see the light then life's alright
,So can you dig it

,Be like that you just be like that

,I jumped inside the jeep as I embark on my darkness
,Popped in my freestyle tapes
,Started reminiscing about my little homie
,Who was raised in Wyoming wanted to be famous
,So he came to Californey on the microphony
,Was super bad and what not
,But he was the kinda fella to follow paths that was hot
,He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
,That he modificated rearranged his behavior
,He hooked up quick with the influential slang
,Gangsta-strow corn rolls the whole shabbang
,Braggin' and boastin', boastin' and braggin'
,How we 'posed to be hangin' with Baby Gees, I was baggin'
,But what you tryin' hooride up on the bandwagon
,Hopin' they'd hit him in the head but he steady saggin'
,Like he a hog creepin' through the smog
,Smokin' on some Indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
,Like most who come to this West Coast society
,Tried to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
,So what a relic way to end this, got rolled up
,When he was strolling on a Sunday after tennis
,Niggas never listen, they gotta learn their lesson
,The hard way I'm guessin', guessin'
,BD as I hit the B and make a right on Weston
,Pops in my head the proverbial question, why?
,Be like that, you just be like that
,Baby, tell me why it's gotta be like that
,Tell me why
,(Baby, tell me why it's gotta be like that)
Uh-huh uhh, uhh, uh-uhh

I surely appreciate it - whoo!
What you about to witness is my thoughts
Just my thoughts man - right or wrong
Just what I was feeling at the time, uhh
You ever felt like this, you vibe with me
Walk with a nigga man - just vibe with me
Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin
And get on down, to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now GIMME back my bread
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to
plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin back
I'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow

Hopeless Hai Tu Phir Bhi Thodi Hope Hai

Haan Tal Gayi, Haan Tal Gayi
Aafat Ki Tarah Tal Gayi
Haan Khal Gayi, Tujhe Khal Gayi
Meri Beparwahi Khal Gayi
Mohtarma Tu Kis Khet Ki Mooli
Hai Zara Bata

Udti Phirti... Udti Phirti Afwah Tera Ghagra
Baghdad Ho Ya Delhi Via Agra

TV Pe Breaking News, Haye Re Mera Ghagra
Baghdad Se Leke Dilli Via Agra

Ghagra Ghagra Tera Ghagra Ghagra
Tera Ghagra Ghagra Via Agra
Ghagra Ghagra Tera Ghagra Ghagra
Tera Ghagra Ghagra Via Agra

Imaandari ki bimari 
Chhod de aaja, daud ke aaja 
O kare dil tujhko invite 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ik tu. ik main. 
Aur ho dim dim ye light 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height. 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height. 
Ik tu. ik main. 
Aur ho dim dim ye light 
Aye bigda hoon main yun 
thoda tu bhi bigad jaa 
Arey aage badhun main 
thoda tu bhi aage badh jaa 
Aaj neeyat thodi hone de kharaab si 
Dikhne lagi hai inn hawaaon me sharaab si 
Sharaab si sharab si, sharab si sharab si 
Sharaab si sharab si, sharab si sharab si 
Saari ki saari, hai jo khumaari 
Aa dono peele lamhe nasheele 
Karein humko ye bada excite 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ik tu. ik main. 
Aur ho dim dim ye light 
Dil ye gaayab ho gaya hai apni jagah se 
Jo bhi hua hai wo hua hai teri wajah se 
Leni hai saanse mujhe ab tere sath mein 
Kahin bhi leja haath leke tere haath me 
Haath mein, haath mein, haath mein 
Saath mein, saath mein, saath mein 
Hai jawaani, kare shaitani 
Iss umar mein, dil ke safar mein 
Kya wrong hai, kya right. 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ik tu. ik main. 
Aur ho dim dim ye light 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ho saari night besharmi ki height 
Ik tu. ik main. 
Aur ho dim-dim ye light 
Wo oo...

(I’m there
I’m there)
Ho meri jaan tera yoon muskurana
Toh galat baat hai
Apne aashiq ko sankat mein laana
Toh galat baat hai
Ho meri jaan tera yoon muskurana
Toh galat baat hai
Apne aashiq ko sankat mein laana
Toh galat baat hai
Jab mein tujhe se mila 19 ka tha
Din yaad hai mujhe valentine ka tha
Dil mein aake yun phir dil se jaana
Toh galat baat hai
(I’m there)
Ho meri jaan tera yoon muskurana
Toh galat baat hai
Apne aashiq ko sankat mein laana
Toh galat baat hai
I’m there
(Instrumental Break)
(Neeti mohan Begins)
Chookar dil ko choo ho jana,
Aadat hai teri buri
Haaye chup ke dikhna,
Dikh ke chupna
Aafat hai dekho badhi
Dhire dhire chadhe jo hai ishq wahi
jaldi jaldi main lena hai risk nahi
(I’m there)
Chodhe kapde pehen ke yoon nachna
Toh galat baat hai
Ho chodhe kapde pehen ke yoon nachna
Toh galat baat hai
Ho khote naino se humko yoon takna
Toh galat baat hai
(Instrumental Break)
(I’m there
I’m there)
Thodi thodi si tere sang,
Main bhi phisalne lagi
Ho thodi thodi tujhse lipat kar
Main bhi sambhalne lagi..
Thoda khudko kudiyon sambhalo zara
Yun khule aam humko patana hai bura
Tum karo toh sahi, hum karein toh
Kyun galat baat hai
Ho pyaar mein kaun jaane sahi kya
Kya galat baat hai
Jab mein tujhe se mila 19 ka tha
Din yaad hai mujhe valentine ka tha
Yun purane lover ko satana
Toh galat baat hai
(I’m there)
Ho meri jaan tera yoon muskurana
Toh galat baat hai
(I’m there)

,曾经意外他和她相爱
,再不会犹豫的时代
,以为明白所以爱的痛快
,一双手紧紧放不开
,心中的执着与未来
,忘不了你的爱
,但结局难更改
,我没能把你留下来
,更不想他能给你
,一个期待的未来
,那幼稚的男孩
,你的关怀一直随身携带
,无人的地方在打开
,想问你现在
,是否忧伤不在
,像躺在阳光下的海
,像用心涂抹的色彩
,让你微笑起来勇敢起来
,忘不了你的爱
,但结局难更改
,我没能把你留下来
,更不想他能给你
,一个期待的未来
,那幼稚的男孩
,想你就现在
,想你每当我又徘徊
,所有遗憾的都不是未来
,所有爱最后都难免逃不过伤害
,不必在重来
,现在我只希望疼痛来的更痛快
,反正不能够重来

,You've never seen it look so easy
,I've tried playing it cool
,Girl when I'm looking at you
,And I'll be gone gone tonight
,The ground beneath my feet is open wide
,The way that I been holdin' on too tight
,I can never be brave
,Cause you make my heart race
,The story of my life I take her home
,I drive all night to keep her warm and time
,Is frozen
,The story of my life
,All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
,All these lights that can't blind me
,With your love
,Baby you light up my world like nobody else
,The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
,But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
,You don't know oh oh
,And we danced all night
,To the best song ever
,We knew every line
,Now I can't remember
,How it goes but I know
,That I won't forget her
,Cause we danced all night
,To the best song ever
,Nobody can drag me down
,Baby you light up,the story of my life,you got that one thing.

,「あっそ」で片付けられて

,なんか笑えてきたって
,あの頃の僕らも愛しく思えてきたんだ
,人1人が生きていくだけで
,何でこんなに辛いのだろう
,共に誰かと生きていくのは
,きっと奇跡みたいな事だよ
,ある日 ある時 ある惑星で
,僕らは出会って離れただけ
,ただそれだけの事が今も
,僕の胸を突き刺してる
,子供達の帰ったあとの夜の公園に
,なんとなく感じたシンパシー
,今年も夏は終わるらしい
,君の大嫌いなこの季節に今はただ
,取り残されていたいだけ
,そこに君がいないだけ Ah

,僕をやけに照らすんだ
,恥ずかしくなって逃げ出そうとした

,Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
,and nothin but the truth so help your black ass?
,you gotta damn right
,Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
,Fuck tha police
,Comin straight from the underground
,Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown
,And not the other color so police think
,They have the authority to kill a minority
,Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one
,For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
,To be beatin on, and throwin in jail
,We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
,Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager
,With a little bit of gold and a pager
,Searchin my car, lookin for the product
,Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
,You'd rather see me in the pen
,Then me and Lorenzo rollin in the Benzo
,Beat tha police outta shape
,And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
,To tape off the scene of the slaughter
,Still can't swallow bread and water
,I don't know if they fags or what
,Search a nigga down and grabbin his nuts
,And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
,But don't let it be a black and a white one
,Cuz they slam ya down to the street top
,Black police showin out for the white cop
,Ice Cube will swarm
,On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
,Just cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
,A young nigga on a warpath
,And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
,Of cops, dyin in LA
,Yo Dre, I got somethin to say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident.>
,Fuck tha police and Ren said it with authority
,because the niggaz on the street is a majority.
,A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
,and the motherfuckin' weapon
,is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
,wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
,Lights start flashin behind me
,But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
,But that shit don't work, I just laugh
,Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
,To the police I'm sayin fuck you punk
,Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk
,Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
,With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
,But take off the gun so you can see what's up
,And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up
,Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
,But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
,I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
,But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
,Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
,Or any assho that threatens me
,I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
,Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
,The muthafuckin villian that's mad
,With potential to get bad as fuck
,So I'm a turn it around
,Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
,Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
,Takin out a police would make my day
,But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
,Fuck the police (4X)~~~~
,
,Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest.
,Get down and put your hands up where I can see em.
,Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor.
,and tell the jury how you feel abou this bullshit.>
,I'm tired of the muthafuckin jackin
,Sweatin my gang while I'm chillin in the shackin
,Shining tha light in my face, and for what
,Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
,I kick ass, or maybe cuz I blast
,On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigga
,Of any Uzi or an AK
,Cuz the police always got somethin stupid to say
,They put up my picture with silence
,Cuz my identity by itself causes violence
,The E with the criminal behavior
,Yeah, I'm a gansta, but still I got flavor
,Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
,A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot,
,By me, or another nigga.
,and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
,MC Ren: Sidle him, kid, he's from the old school, foo
,And as you all know, E's here to rule
,Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
,And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
,Dumb muthafucka with a gun
,And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be tha one
,That I take out, and then get away
,And while I'm drivin off laughin
,This is what I'll say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,
,whitebread, chickenshit muthafucka.
,Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie.

The only one I know
Has come to take me away
The only one I know
Is mine when she stitches me
The only one I see
Has found an aching in me
The only one I see
Has turned her tongue into me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

The only one I know
Never cries, never open her eyes
The only one I know
Wide awake and then she's away
The only one I see
Is mine when she walks down our street
The only one I see
Has carved her way in to me

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain
Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

Everyone has been burned before
Everybody knows the pain

,before the world fell at our feet
,There's such a difference between us
,And a million miles
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,that I've done
,But when I call you
,never seem to be home
,to tell you
,Hello how are you
,It's so typical of me
,to talk about myself
,I'm sorry
,I hope

,Did you ever make it out of that town
,Where nothing ever happened
,It's no secret
,That the both of us
,are running out of time
,So hello from the other side

,to tell you I'm sorry
,for breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

would give it all,
for a chance to be with you,
When I'm in your arms,
I feel love, and I know you feel it too…
Cause every breath you take will clear my way,
I hope the love we share comes true someday…
I'm losing my mind when I think of you,
And you are always around,
in my thoughts
it's nothing new…
Cause every breath you take
will clear my way,
I hope the love we share
comes true someday…
There is no place
I'd rather be,
than anywhere with you
Cause every breath you take
will clear my way,
I hope the love we share comes true someday…

,And I get you I know
,The way you turn around and chase away the smoke
,Go bring it all down
,Before the night comes down and breaks your heart and bones
,
,And so away you go but hopes are getting close
,You are so cold, days were high and low
,They've been and gone, strangled as you are
,You are so cold

Ow!
Ho!

Alot of people say that you can make it in this world today.
But, I know exactly how, I'd like to show ya if you let me now.

Just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line just be yourself. Just be yourself put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

Sometimes it might take long to clear your mind and make yourself feel strong.

I know its worth the wait just tighten up and keep your head on straight. Just be yourself say what's on your mind just be yourself.

Put it on the line just be yourself, say what's on your mind, just be yourself, put it on the line!

If you think you have something to say, don't you hold back just...say it. Why do you think you have to take all that the people say?

,Before it all starts they suffer through harm just to touch a dream

,Rise from the ashes, smoke from the gun
,Dust from the fallout, covers the sun
,So just let me find my way, reckless and young

Yo! Feel the flow - Que pasa? Paradoxx!
Gente adelante - You know it never stops.

The lyrics have flown - yo - now it's time to rock
get high to the rhythm - we never stop
Insane in the brain - to another dimension.
Put your hands in the air - hey, close attention.
Back on the mic - yo - check the flow
jump to the rhythm - jump - drop the tempo
drop the groove - now, drop the cuts.
Rewind the tape to select Paradoxx.

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose
,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing
,And I was runnin' outta luck
,I never thought I’d find this feeling
,'Cause I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me (A rhapsody for you and me)
,And every melody is timeless

,Let's see how far
,We can take this without breaking hearts
,See what we're made of
,So what are we afraid of?
,
,We pretend we're not falling
,But you can't keep your hands off of me
,You caught me without warning
,You hold me, you hold me
,Closer enough to see right through me
,I can't take my eyes off of you
,You caught me without warning
,You hold me, you hold me
,
,You hold me
,
,Wanna be where you are
,I'm drowning in my thoughts, I'm losing sleep
,It's just perception
,But I wish that you were lying next to me

,I feel a lot less younger then I did last year
,But have I start wondering, lost all fear
,Of the dark, of the dark
,Can you tell me, when did you become my ghost?

,In your arms, in your arms

,I just drive through the night with the memories
,Down the same back streets while the songs plays
,On repeat, on repeat
,Now time has gone, most has haunted me
,And you went on, I can't look in my eyes
,In the string, in the string
,
,But I'm talking to you, you, you, you

,These hearts are cold, its hard no joke
,We go for broke (lips touch face up)
,You say it yourself, I'm heaven, I'm hell
,You crack my shell (fake that gets off)
,Favorite room at the Roosevelt
,Head is spinning like carousel
,Strip tease and tequila
,Mad love is a healer
,Til' I knock you off your pedestal
,Blame my shit on the chemicals
,'Cause I always speak my feelings
,I mean it

,You have your doubts (I don't blame ya)
,I'm weak I'm tough, fuck up, makeup
,Then words get rough (that's my nature)
,I stay unpredictable
,Borderline too cynical
,You bounce out that crazy
,So between my feelings
,
,So I put on you on that pedestal
,All on fire like chemical

, It's three o'clock in the morning
, No one can make me go home
, 'Cause no one's waiting there for me
, And I just can't be alone

, I'm just gonna fall in faster
, 'Cause I don't wanna go slow, oh
, Go slow, oh
, No one likes being honest, but I'mma give you that
, So ask me how much I want you, and I'mma whisper back
, How many other girls you know
, Say it "all up front, I'll take care of you"
, 'Cause now I fell for the bad one, and it never lasts
, So I don't wanna go slow, oh

,I can't help it, I just–
,Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
,I can't help it, I just–
,I’ve got the reach and the teeth of a killin’ machine,
,with a need to bleed you when the light goes green
,best believe, I’m in a zone to be, from my Yin to my Yang to my Yang Tze
,put a grin on my chin when you come to me,
,‘cuz I’ll win, I’m a one-of-a-kind and I’ll bring death
,to the place you’re about to be: another river of blood runnin’ under my feet
,forged in a fire lit long ago, stand next to me, you’ll never stand alone
,I’m last to leave, but the first to go, Lord, make me dead before you make me old
,I feed on the fear of the devil inside of the enemy faces in my sights:
,aim with the hand, shoot with the mind, kill with a heart like arctic ice
,I am a soldier and I’m marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,
,I bask in the glow of the rising war, lay waste to the ground of an enemy shore
,wade through the blood spilled on the floor, and if another one stands I’ll kill some more
,bullet in the breach and a fire in me, like a cigarette thrown, to gasoline
,if death don’t bring you fear, I swear, you’ll fear these marchin’ feet
,Come to the nightmare, come to me, deep down in the dark where the devil be
,in the maw with the jaws and the razor teeth,
,where the brimstone burns and the angel weeps
,call to the gods if I cross your path and my silhouette hangs like a body bag
,hope is a moment now long past, the shadow of death is the one I cast.
,I am a soldier and I’m marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,my eyes are steel and my gaze is long
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,now I live lean and I mean to inflict the grief,
,and the least of me is still out of your reach
,the killing machine’s gonna do the deed,
,until the river runs dry and my last breath leaves
,chin in the air with a head held high,
,I’ll stand in the path of the enemy line
,feel no fear, know my pride:
,for God and Country I’ll end your life
,I am a soldier and I’m marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,my eyes are steel and my gaze is long
,I am a warrior and this is my song

,Mi vida era normal hasta que descubrí youtube
,Podía pasarme horas y más horas viendo lo que todos suben
,Quería ser como ellos es difícil me imagino
,Comencé a trabajar sin importarme el destino
,Contaba con el apoyo de algunos de mis amigos
,Por desgracia me fallaron algunos por el camino
,Pero pese a quien le pese a veces la vida no es justa
,Unos se rinden y otros luchan por aquello que les gusta
,Yo!
,Quiero ser youtuber poder llevar mi propio canal
,Tener familia fans
,A mi nunca me dijeron como debo empezar
,Tengo mil dudas que me surgen no sé si hacer spam
,Yo se que el tren pasa una vez no dejes que este se te escape
,Conseguir mi propia placa para mi era algo importante
,Representa mi trabajo el gran esfuerzo y ser constante
,Se que los sue?os se cumplen quiero el botón de diamante
,Le agradezco a mi gente por quererme como soy
,Sé que sin ellos no estaría donde estoy
,Le pido a dios que esto no acabe por favor
,Por eso siempre os llevaré a todos en mi corazón

,Aun recuerdo aquel momento en que llegué a los diez mil
,Estaba muy feliz
,Me dio todo un subidón
,Quizás llegue a los cien mil
,O con suerte al millón
,Después yo me independicé mis padres me dieron más pena
,Y paso más tiempo con gente que me rodea
,Ahora comparto piso con mi amigo y pedimos para la cena
,La gente nos conoce y ahora todos nos shippean
,Me resultaba extra?o para mi era todo nuevo
,Forjarte tu futuro jugando a los videojuegos
,En mi caso yo hago música pero esa no es la única
,Salida que youtube te ofrece a ti ni mucho menos
,Desde luego
,Que quiero
,Jugar a videojuegos y sentir que rozo el cielo
,?Qué importará el dinero?
,Harás lo que te gusta sin que importe lo que ganes
,Tampoco quiero saber nada de las cazapartners
,Le agradezco a mi gente por quererme como soy,
,Sé que sin ellos no estaría donde estoy
,Le pido a dios que esto no acabe por favor

,Will you open your eyes, is the world insane?

,Emptied a mag in the middle of the game
,Our stains on the newstands
,Like a photograph in the killers hand

,What's its worth? Forget your love for money

,Because we are expecting the children to save us all
,But how can they save us?
,If they don't even have any examples
,Well what kind of examples, preacher?
,Example of leadership, love, peace, joy and harmony
,Those examples of caring and sharing
,See we must break those generational curses
,That peck our families and communities
,They must know that knowledge is power
,And wisdom is gaining understanding
,The Bible says train up a child in the way they should go
,And when they become old, they shall not deport from it
,I always hear us praising that famous slogan
,Each one - teach one
,But are we really doing our best to be effective in lives of our children?
,Only God can save our souls!

,Almost something so close
,On the outlines of your west coast

,We were subtle, we were drastic
,We were calm, we were dramatic
,We were fantasy and fear
,And you changed me
,You were sunny and you faced me
,Yeah, you saw me and encouraged me
,Like a tourist, souvenir (woah)

,Saltimbanque, Fier de l'être,
,Depuis tout petit je suis amoureux des lettres
,Et aussi bizarre
,Que cela puisse paraitre
,J'ai écrit au départ
,Pour combattre mon mal-être
,Je me suis battu pour y'arriver
,Mettant entre parenthèses ma vie privée
,Et même si cela était le prix à payer
,Jamais je ne le regretterai
,Et tout le monde
,Lè lè lè lève les mains en l'air
,Moi j'ai choisi la musique car je préfère l’atmosphère
,Des boites de nuit, de la foule et des salles de concert
,Je ne suis qu'un saltimbanque
,Pourtant je vise le top
,Lè lè lè lève les mains en l'air

,Difficilement impressionné
,Pour mon public j'ai tout donné
,Et j'n'ai jamais abandonné
,Même si les galères tu connais
,Tache de ne pas déconner
,Car tu ne peux même pas soup?onner
,Ce que la vie peut te donner
,Non je n'vais pas changer
,Le monde avec des paroles
,Parce que je n'suis ni tes parents
,Ni ton maitre d'école
,Je ne suis pas un exemple
,Et encore moins une idole
,J'veux juste que ton moral décolle

一不小心弄丢了曾经的初恋
记忆中那张青春荡漾的脸
经常在心里不经意的回旋
祈求上苍让我们再次遇见

不想岁月淹没那张熟悉的脸
怕模糊了梦里长长的缠绵
是不是心有所想千次默念
看那熟悉的身影闪过眼前

一帘幽梦在现实中出现
记忆中那对诱人的眼
多了点成熟魅力不减
勾起我心底深藏的爱恋

回忆第一次亲吻你的脸
你羞涩的闭起了双眼
心里的甜蜜再次涌现
紫藤花开再次爬满心间

最美的情郎

今夜东山顶 升起了皎洁的月亮
你用不老的月光 写下情诗两行
一行化作了殿前 悠远的藏香
一行凝结成眼中 清澈的泪光
  
今夜理塘 是谁的歌声在回荡
让仙鹤的翅膀 带你飞到我身旁
你说只愿和有情人 做快乐的事
我**在时光里 等你为我梳妆
  
雪域里你是最大的王
人世间你是最美的情郎
你是我心上最温暖的念想
就像拉萨城最明艳的阳光
  
雪域里你是最大的王
人世间你是最美的情郎
如果前世今生都终将错过
我会等你在**的路上
  
我不爱雪域里最大的王
只爱你世间上最美的情郎

我是真的不想分开
心里是那么的伤怀 
求求你珍惜我们的现在
让我在感受到你的爱

爱不是践踏和伤害 
真情需要真爱来灌溉 
难道上辈子欠了你的债 
要我用一生补偿等待 

你真的真的是我的爱 
却让我深深陷进苦海 
我不知道是继续还是离开 
心痛的感觉无法说出来
            
你真的真的是我的爱 
却把我绝情的来伤害 
昔日的柔情蜜意已经不在
多想重温初恋时的那种爱

月披轻纱鸟朦胧
天籁寂静蝉不鸣

多少情意无言中

劲雨不解浓浓情
双目凝望天边星
方知黄粱人无影

梦离别离别梦中
可恨小楼又东风
未曾折柳来相送
怎就甜蜜已成空

梦离别离别梦中
谁把缱绻化成空
不求能许山海盟
只盼有缘再相逢

只盼有缘再相逢

-----间奏-----

疾风吹落满地红
劲雨不解浓浓情

我们有最美的相遇
丁香中寻找五瓣的真谛
天空下着毛毛细雨
原来幸福可以偶遇

你就是我梦里的鱼 
心的海洋任你而游弋 
我是鸟儿伴你飞翔 
守护着你平安嬉戏

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
我们的相遇就注定了结局
是上天安排这游戏
不是谁要把谁遗弃

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
相遇就注定了今天的结局
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍 

……间奏……

我们有刻骨的分离
冬日雪花夹着冰冷的雨
相对的目光在游离
破碎在这寒冷冬季

你是要远行的游鱼
心儿向往神秘的海底
水面蒙上冰做的墙
风儿催我他乡栖息

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
我们的相遇就注定了结局
是上天安排这游戏
不是谁要把谁遗弃

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
相遇就注定了今天的结局
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍
我们注定了分离

青青草原辽阔的牧场
蓝蓝天空白云在飘荡
牧马少年坐在马背上
轻舞长鞭追逐着牛羊

微风吹来阵阵的花香
动听的牧歌随风飞扬
热情奔放的牧羊姑娘
是我心中最美的月亮
  

姑娘姑娘你在我心上
草原的雄鹰为你翱翔
草原的花儿为你绽放
请你快快来到我身旁


姑娘姑娘你在我心上
奶茶飘香是你的芬芳
格桑花开是你的嫁妆
美丽毡房梦中的天堂

,Last night I was thinking
,About the time when I was weakened
,When I let you take advantage
,Those were the times
,Those were the times
,Ah, ah...
,This morning I was remembering
,About the times when I became more stubborn
,And when I decided that I was stronger
,Than how you made me feel
,Those times are real
,I used to lose myself so I could find you quicker
,I used to lose myself so I could love you better
,Ah, ah...
,I used to lose myself so I could find you quicker
,I used to lose myself so I could love you better

,Luv(sic)
,Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
,developing this new theory of relativity
,connecting our souls resting in captivity,
,positive life sacrifice what it is to me
,our history, only a quarter of a century
,reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
,see ain't no mystery, the colours that we mix will set the mind free,
,let the blind see beyond harmony!
,breathe life into dead space blow away all clouds of doubt
,new territory we determine to be
,everything a safe haven is supposed to be
,now it might seem distant but the time is near
,when our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
,pure sound waves travel semi-infinitely,
,plus I'll see you there utmost definitely!
,'cause the beat plus the melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,'cause the beat plus the melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
,god bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
,for some words that have waited for way too long
,low wages, small tips on the avenue
,never wasted, all hits for a revenue
,haven't you heard the news lately?
,seems we've been living for sometimes in a purgatory
,but yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
,but I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
,I could still hear it in the room past midnite,
,gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
,sometimes I do forget , oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
,if we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
,return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
,so you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to express definition of grace
,but the method I choose my prerogative,
,there's so much love in me I got to give!
,'cause your beat plus my melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,'cause my beat plus your melody makes me speak of l.o.v.e. eloquently, so evidently
,oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel,
,but how about this song that I wrote for you?
,what I feel like... I wanna put my trust in these simple words
,for you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
,reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together?
,remember the time that you told me in the cold night,
,to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
,remember the time that I spoke to a crowd in a full house and realized that you was my ace?
,I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
,all eyes on me and had nothing to prove
,but yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
,but I felt a sharper love in the limelight,
,from the queen of hearts watching me quietly in the upper deck balcony
,sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
,when I look back at that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
,now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
,for you to know that the music help us carry on,
,like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

,
,This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P.
,A message to God
,Since you finishin him early, what posessed you to start him?
,We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
,Lord, I thought we was made for each other
,You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
,Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
,I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
,You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
,you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
,He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
,The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
,I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why
,Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it
,We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do
,We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
,He had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow
,Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go
,Listen listen listen.
,Listen listen listen.
,Listen listen listen.
,Listen. mmm-mmm-mmm
,If you wanna know why. {why I live my life}
,The way that I do. {cause I got to get this money}
,So don't worry about me. {cause I know my way around}
,I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper
,Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
,Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
,If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
,I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
,We lost a thug, a son, and a father

,Y'all know me, still the same O.G., but I been low key
,Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's
,No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
,Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
,Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall full of plaques
,Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
,Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?Hoe please
,You better bow down on both knees
,Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
,Who you think brought you the oldies?
,Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's
,The Snoop D-O-double-G's and the group that said mother-"Fuck Tha Police"
,Gave you a tape full of dope beats to bump when youstroll through in your hood
,And when your album sales wasn't doin too good who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
,Y'all better listen up closely
,All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped
,Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
,So FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME!
,Y'all are gonna keep fuckin around wit me and turn me back to the old me

,So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
,Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way?
,Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (YUP)
,Then just study a tape of N.W.A.!
,One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when Icaught a guy give me an awkward eye (What you lookin at?)
,And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani
,I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
,I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge when I'm drunk as fuck
,Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage{CRUNCH}
,Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off
,"Fuck you too bitch, call the cops!"
,I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
,And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
,Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
,And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE)
,From here on out it's the Chronic 2
,Startin today and tomorrow's the new
,And I'm still loco enough
,To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
,Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babiesin aMercedes Benz wit the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
,Callin men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy
,There's no way that you can save me
,It's okay, go with him Hailey (Da-da?)

,But now that I got this little company
,Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
,But you won't get a crumb from me
,Cause I'm from the streets of (Compton, Compton)
,I told em all - all them little gangstas
,Who you think helped mold 'em all?
,Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none
,What you think I sold 'em all?
,Cause I stay well off
,Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
,What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad tryin toget this damn label off?
,I ain't havin that; this is the millenium of Aftermath
,It ain't gon' be nothin after that
,So give me one more platinum plaqueand fuck rap!You can have it back
,So where's all the Madd Rappers at?

, Head in the clouds, both looking down
, Doesn't mean that we're falling, oh
,
, We can keep it simple, baby
, Let's not make it complicated
, Labels are so overrated
, Let's not make it complicated
, Rules are meant for breaking, baby
, Let's not make it complicated
, Why don't we just go get naked?
, Let's not make it complicated

,诱惑我投降
,说我已长大

,穿过黑夜走向黎明
,不回头看只想前进
,就会有意义
,想走过九百六十万平方公里
,穿过平淡无奇等奇迹

,我相信从无到有不止运气
,从零开始不过练习

不要追问对与错 
毕竟我们深爱过 
有你陪的日子里 
我真的好快乐 
你总是小心翼翼的 
因为你怕我难过
而我却不能给你
给你想要的结果
一万个舍不得 
不能回到从前了 
爱你没有后悔过 
只是应该结束了 
一万个舍不得 
我是永远爱你的
爱你我觉得值得 
只是不能再爱了
不要追问对与错 
毕竟我们深爱过
有你陪的日子里 
我真的真的好快乐 
你总是小心翼翼的 
因为你怕我难过
而我却不能给你想要的结果
你永远都是最好的
分开了 不代表不爱你了
我心里 你永远都是最好的

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,All you hear are oohhs and ahhhs as the kids go
,Off into a trance got their eyes hypnotized
,By the colors and sounds , it's like no others around
,It's like they lit up the town , like the speaker's surround sound
,And everything is vivid , captured every minute
,Admit it we got to live it now , cuz the summer won't be around forever

,You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
,But I'll be fine
,
,Why we fight? I don't know
,We say what hurts the most
,Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
,All these firing shots and making ground
,It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go
,
,Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
,When it don't work out for the better

Khushboo Hai Ya Nasha
Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane

Ladki Hai Ya Hai Jaadu
Khushboo Hai Ya Nasha
Paas Wo Aaye To
Chhoo Ke Main Dekhoon Zara
Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane
Poochhoon To Main Zara
Dekhe Wo Idhar Hanske Bekhabar
Thaamke Dil Hum Khade Hain
Gumsum Si Nazar Uski Hai Magar
Honthon Pe Shikve Bade Hain
Baat Ban Jaaye To
Main Baat Chhedoon Zara
Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane
Poochhoon To Main Zara
Ladki Hai Ya Hai Jaadu
Khushboo Hai Ya Nasha
Sharma Wo Gayi Ghabra Vo Gayi
Maine Jo Usko Pukaara
Ye Dil Le Liya Usne Kar Diya
Aankhon Hi Aankhon Mein Ishaara
Jaan Bhi Jaaye To
Gam Na Karoon Main Zara
Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane
Poochhoon To Main Zara
Ladki Hai Ya Hai Jaadu
Khushboo Hai Ya Nasha
Mehfil Mein Haseen Tu Hi To Nahin
Roothe Tu Kis Liye Akeli
Jis Pe Yoon Fida Ye Dil Ho Gaya
Wo To Hai Teri Ek Saheli
Maan Vo Jaaye To
Baahon Mein Le Loon Zara
Ruk Ja O Dil Deewane
Poochhoon To Main Zara
Ladki Hai Ya Hai Jaadu
Khushboo Hai Ya Nasha
Paas Wo Aaye To
Chhoo Ke Main Dekhoon Zara.

People have started calling me crazy lover
Ye deewangi hai kya
What is this sort of craziness
Humein bhi to ho pata
We should also get to know
Tumko kya ho gaya
What has happened to You
Arre kal tak mujhko sab hosh tha
Till yesterday, I was in all my senses
Dil mein khushiyon ka josh tha
In my heart there was a strong sense of happiness
Phir ye becheini hai kyon
Then why is this uneasiness
Phir ye betaabi hai kyon
They why is this restlessness
Kya koi kho gaya
Did someone disappear

Koi mil gaya koi mil gaya
I found someone
Mera dil gaya mera dil gaya
My heart went away
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
O Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Koi mil gaya, mil hi gaya
I found someone finally
Mil gaya hey 
Found someone hey
Mil hi gaya mil gaya
Found someone finally

Baadal banke kaun aa gaya
Who has come and covered us like a cloud
Kaun hai jo dil pe yoon chha gaya
Who has come and conquered our hearts
Baadal banke kaun aa gaya
Who has come and covered us like a cloud
Kaun hai jo dil pe yoon chha gaya
Who has come and conquered our hearts
Chaahoon ki bataoon main
I want to tell You about it
Phir bhi keh na paoon main
But still I cannot describe it to You
Naam uska hai kya
What is her name
O naam na lo par kuchh to kaho
Oh! Don't take her name, but still say something
Halka sa koi ishaara to do
At least give us a small hint 
Meri aankhon mein hai vo
She is in my eyes
Meri saanson mein hai vo
She is in my breath
Aur kahoon tumse kya
What more should I tell You

Koi mil gaya koi mil gaya
I found someone
Mera dil gaya o mera dil gaya
My heart went away
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Koi mil gaya 
I found someone
Mil hi gaya mil gaya 
Found someone finally
Hey mil hi gaya mil gaya
Found someone finally

Mujhko kya hua hai
What has happened to me
Kyon main kho gaya hoon
Where have I gotten lost
Paagal tha main pehle 
Was I crazy like this before
Ya ab ho gaya hoon
Or have I gotten crazy now
Behki hai nigahein 
Your eyes are intoxicated
Aur bikhre hain baal
And Your hair are withered
Tumne banaya hai
What state have You
Kya apna ye haal
Made of Yourself

O koi mil gaya koi mil gaya
I found someone
Arre mera dil gaya o mera dil gaya
My heart went away
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
Kya bataoon yaaron
What should I say friends
O Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Main to hil gaya
I just got shaken
Koi mil gaya 
I found someone
Mil hi gaya mil gaya 
Found someone finally
Mil hi gaya
Found someone finally
Mil hi gaya mil hi gaya
Found someone finally
Mil hi gaya mil hi gaya
Found someone finally

Әже,
балалық шақта!
Әлди әніңмен, ержеттім еркелеп.
Әже,
бозбала шақта!
Әз әуеніңмен, ән айтым сізге арнап.

Желкемнен иіскеп, тоймаушы едің әже...
Әлдилеуші едің тәтті әніңмен.
Сағындым мен жылы қойныңды,
Сездіртпейсің еш уайымды аже.
Көрінші, бір түсімде!

Әже,
өзіңмен өткен күн!
Оралмас шіркін,
Балдай бақытты дәурен!
Әже,
қайда әкетті?
Сізді ұрлап алып,
Сұм жалған көшкен керуен?!

Таба алмай сізді жүрмін, жүдеп бүгін,
Ақ шылау ұшты, елестеп жүзің...
Түсіме кіріп, күнім деп сүйіп,
Бір сәт кейде, қуантшы мені әже!..
Өтінем бір өзіңнен...

Аппақ самайың,
Әнім әрдайым.
Балаң ержетті,
Көрдің бе, әже?..

Желкемнен иіскеп, тоймаушы едің әже...
Әлдилеуші едің тәтті әніңмен.
Сағындым мен жылы қойныңды,
Сездіртпейсің еш уайымды аже.
Көрінші, бір түсімде!
歌词翻译：
Әже 奶奶
奶奶，我的童年，听着您的歌谣，快乐的成长
奶奶，年少时，我用我的方式，为你歌唱
奶奶你总会亲吻着我的脖子，说永远都不够
总会唱着甜美的歌谣，送我入梦乡
我想念您温暖的怀抱，
你从不会让我感受到忧愁，
奶奶，让我在梦里再见你一面！

奶奶，那些和你在一起的日子，
那些甜蜜的时光，一去再也不复返
奶奶，你去了哪里
是不是时光老人把你
从我的世界里偷偷带走了
再也找不到你的我
时常陷入深深的想念
您披着白色头巾总会浮现在我的脑海
您走近我亲吻着我的脸颊
让我再一次依偎在您的怀里
奶奶你总会亲吻着我的脖子，说永远都不够
总会唱着甜美的歌谣，送我入梦乡
我想念您温暖的怀抱，
你从不会让我感受到忧愁，
奶奶，让我在梦里再见你一面！

,再美的承诺也会有疲倦
,岁月的痕迹永远不改变
,不知你是否还在怀念
,是不是还想回到从前
,让我们的故事再重演
,就算结局不变

Махаббат жүректе ғажап әнге ұласқан,
Айнала ғашықтық сезім мәңгі дастанға.
Құс жолын серуендеп күнде жұлдызға мініп,
Екеуміз самғайық бірге зеңгір аспанда... 
We can fly in the sky!

2-куплет.
Болмаспын 
Касыңда жүрсем айналам қалай шат?
Тосады Марс та бізді сайран талай шақ.
Ғарышта күндерді шіркін, өткізіп бірге,
Мәңгілік тұрақтап қалсақ айда сарай сап!
We can fly in the sky!

,孤单的我还是没有改变
,美丽的梦何时才能出现
,亲爱的你好想再见你一面
,秋天的风一阵阵地吹过
,想起了去年的这个时候
,你的心到底在想些什么
,为什么留下这个结局让我承受
,最爱你的人是我你怎么舍得我难过
,在我最需要你的时候没有一句话就走

歌词大意：
萨马勒山 我挚爱的故乡
像镜子一样的湖水
如今我是士兵却不是为你而战
每天都是煎熬
你总是一次又一次的
出现在我的脑海里
生我 割下我脐带的我挚爱的土地
我们没有马
双脚已麻木没有知觉
好像已经走了15天
好像已经快到下一个战场了
我好像已经轮了两次本命年了
我记得我是牛年生的
命运把我驱赶到了如今的苍凉
萨马勒山 我挚爱的故乡
你曾就那样留在了身后
我们就像走丢了的马一样
再也找不到自己的马群
我们没有马
双脚已麻木没有了知觉
好像已经走了15天
好像已经快到下一个战场了
我家中也有父母
他们也已经年迈而苍老
让我唱出这样的歌
就是16年将临在我们身上的灾难

,笑 就歌颂 一皱眉头就心痛
,我没空理会我 只感受你的感受
,你要往哪走 把我灵魂也带走
,它为你着了魔 留着有什么用
,你是电 你是光 你是唯一的神话
,我只爱你 You are my super star
,你主宰 我崇拜 没有更好的办法
,只能爱你 You are my super star
,手 不是手 是温柔的宇宙
,我这颗小星球 就在你手中转动
,请 看见我 让我有梦可以做
,我为你发了疯 你必须奖励我
,你是电 你是光 你是唯一的神话
,我只爱你 You are my super star
,你主宰 我崇拜 没有更好的办法
,只能爱你 You are my super star
,你是 意义
,是天 是地 是神的旨意
,除了 爱你 没有真理
,你是电 你是光 你是唯一的神话
,我只爱你 You are my super star
没有你的日子我有多想你
分手那天 我看着你走远
所有承诺化成了句点
独自守在空荡的房间
爱与痛在我心里纠缠
我们的爱走到了今天
是不是我太自私了一点
如果爱可以重来
我会为你放弃一切
想你的夜
多希望你能在我身边
不知道你心里还能否为我改变
想你的夜
求你让我再爱你一遍
让爱再回到原点

春风，扬起你我的离別
夏雨，打湿孤单的屋檐
秋叶，收到你的明信片
冬雪，转眼又是一年
在，想你的三百六十五天
听，你我最爱的那首歌
泪，总是一不小心翻涌微笑的脸
突然我感觉，你沒走远
(music)
怀里，有你紧拥的温度
眼里，有你微笑和痛哭
心里，有你说过的故事
嗬......梦里，你在回家的路
在，想你的三百六十五天
读，你写來的每句安慰
爱，圈住你我在同一个圆
你的冷热我能感觉
在，想你的三百六十五天
海，我多想能看得更远
爱，两颗心剪不断的长线
我的喜悲都让你包围
怀里，有你紧拥的温度
眼里，有你微笑和痛哭
心里，有你说过的故事
嗬......梦里，你在回家的路

Баяу батқан күн,
Қараңғы суық түн.
Жүректегі жалғыздықты,
айта алар кім?
Серуендеп жүрмін,
Ауыр әр қадамым.
Басқаларда мен сияқты
жалғыз мүмкін?!
Сағыныштың салмағы,
Тым ауырлап барады.
Кім сен жайлы ойлап,
кім сағынады?
Ең соңында алыстауға...
Бір себеп бар ма,
Бұлай жазалауға?
Арамызда ескі үндерде...
Өткен күндерден,
елес қалды ма?
Түнгі шамдарға,
Сен де қарадың ба?
Ол менің сағынған кезім
байқадың ба?
Осы қалада,
Бір өзіңнен басқа...
Ойлайтын, сағынатын жан
қалмаған ба?..

,Hello
,it's me
,I was wondering
,if after all these years
,You'd like to meet to go over
,They say that time's supposed to heal ya
,But I ain't done much healing
,Hello
,can you hear me
,I'm in California dreaming about
,who we used to be
,When we were younger and free
,I've forgotten how it felt
,before the world fell at our feet
,There's such a difference between us
,And a million miles
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,that I've done
,But when I call you
,never seem to be home
,to tell you
,Hello how are you
,It's so typical of me
,to talk about myself
,I'm sorry
,I hope
,that you're well
,Did you ever make it out of that town
,Where nothing ever happened
,It's no secret
,That the both of us
,are running out of time
,So hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,that I've done
,But when I call you never
,seem to be home to tell you
,Hello from the outside
,I must've called a thousand times
,to tell you
,I'm sorry for everything
,But when I call you never
,seem to be home
,Hello from the outside
,At least I can say
,that I've tried
,to tell you I'm sorry
,for breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

,N.W.A——fuck tha police
,
,Right about now NWA court is in full effect.
,Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
,Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren Ice Cube and Eazy muthafuckin E.
,Order order order. Ice Cube take the muthafuckin stand.
,Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
,and nothin but the truth so help your black ass?
,you gotta damn right
,Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
,Fuck tha police
,Comin straight from the underground
,Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown
,And not the other color so police think
,They have the authority to kill a minority
,Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one
,For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
,To be beatin on, and throwin in jail
,We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
,Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager
,With a little bit of gold and a pager
,Searchin my car, lookin for the product
,Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
,You'd rather see me in the pen
,Then me and Lorenzo rollin in the Benzo
,Beat tha police outta shape
,And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
,To tape off the scene of the slaughter
,Still can't swallow bread and water
,I don't know if they fags or what
,Search a nigga down and grabbin his nuts
,And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
,But don't let it be a black and a white one
,Cuz they slam ya down to the street top
,Black police showin out for the white cop
,Ice Cube will swarm
,On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
,Just cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
,A young nigga on a warpath
,And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
,Of cops, dyin in LA
,Yo Dre, I got somethin to say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident.>
,Fuck tha police and Ren said it with authority
,because the niggaz on the street is a majority.
,A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
,and the motherfuckin' weapon
,is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
,wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
,Lights start flashin behind me
,But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
,But that shit don't work, I just laugh
,Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
,To the police I'm sayin fuck you punk
,Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk
,Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
,With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
,But take off the gun so you can see what's up
,And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up
,Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
,But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
,I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
,But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
,Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
,Or any assho that threatens me
,I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
,Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
,The muthafuckin villian that's mad
,With potential to get bad as fuck
,So I'm a turn it around
,Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
,Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
,Takin out a police would make my day
,But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
,Fuck the police (4X)~~~~
,
,Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest.
,Get down and put your hands up where I can see em.
,Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor.
,and tell the jury how you feel abou this bullshit.>
,I'm tired of the muthafuckin jackin
,Sweatin my gang while I'm chillin in the shackin
,Shining tha light in my face, and for what
,Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
,I kick ass, or maybe cuz I blast
,On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playin with the trigga
,Of any Uzi or an AK
,Cuz the police always got somethin stupid to say
,They put up my picture with silence
,Cuz my identity by itself causes violence
,The E with the criminal behavior
,Yeah, I'm a gansta, but still I got flavor
,Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
,A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot,
,By me, or another nigga.
,and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
,MC Ren: Sidle him, kid, he's from the old school, foo
,And as you all know, E's here to rule
,Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
,And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
,Dumb muthafucka with a gun
,And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be tha one
,That I take out, and then get away
,And while I'm drivin off laughin
,This is what I'll say
,Fuck the police (4X)
,
,The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,
,whitebread, chickenshit muthafucka.
,Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie.
,I want justice! I want justice!
,Fuck you, you black muthafucka!>
,
,Fuck the police (3X)
,
,
,Ladies and Gentlemans
,This an ode to the b-boy
,b-girls
,The people out there who do it for the love
,And belive me i'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid，
,I'm trying to get paid too
,But I got one question
,Whatever happened to the heart
,That pumped the passion into the art
,The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start
,Break dancin',imma battling doing it at the park
,Where the mission was expression not only to top charts
,I dont know what happened wanting to blow rap
,You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
,Radio's lackin'
,controlled by Fascists assholes doin' damage
,But we're gunna take it back
,Before beats to a hundred g's a pop
,All you needed was a table top and a beat box
,Hip-hop with out the b-boy is like
,shelltoes only havin' two stripes
,Hip-hop we're freedom-fighting graffiti-writing party types,
,That recite and organize and revitalize our rhymin till the group of the money makers systems knows the industry can eventually get served.
,Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolutions throughout our words
,If you really want it come on get it coz i've got it
,I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn.
,If you wanna earn your stripes you gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike.
,The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
,or never be documented in the Coke(?) commercial.
,(We be the badest)
,Now b-boys, b-girls
,bring it back to the block.
,Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock.
,If you record without thought then stop,
,because I'll serve ya whole album with the goddamn beatbox.
,Without thought it just happens.
,If you gotta think to feel that's not rapping that's acting.
,I'm from a land of backpacks and fat-caps,
,MC's with sick raps who serve those that are wack.
,It's a way of life;
,I put all my energy into the melody on the MPC's until the death of me, record exceptionally, especially, whenever i be monumentally, gramatically, killing the mic.
,I tell my DJ's, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays,
,Staying into it, breaking and grooving(?), and MC's they, thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make, taking from lucid (??).
,All the people gotta make their money,
,and the way to make money is to get inside of the industry,
,take it on the radio, flow
,so you can go blow,
,we get a car and a crib up on MTV,
,but,In the end what's classic?radio bubblegum?
,or a voice filled with passion?
,To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up,
,'cause the only people that can preserve this art is us!
,
,
,Excuse the smirk on my face
,I find it hard to erase
,When you said, you said you were leaving
,Wasn't funny at the time
,But I knew baby in my mind
,was yourself that you where deceiving.
,Didn't I tell you, you'd be coming back
,Didn't I tell you, I ain't having that, no, no
,Now you wanna come on back to me
,Talking about the way it used to be now
,I hate to say I told you so
,(But I told you so)
,...hate to say I told you so
,(But I told you so)
,What you reap
,Is what you sow
,What goes around comes around
,Now you know
,And I hate to say I told you so.
,What we had was bonafide
,Saw green grass from the other side
,Then you said you said you were leaving
,I feel a cliche coming on
,don't know a good thing when its gone
,Well so long but who you deceiving
,Didn't I tell you, you'd be coming back
,Didn't I tell you, I ain't having that, no, no
,Now you wanna come on back to me
,Talking about the way it used to be
,I hate to say I told you so
,(But I told you so)
,...hate to say I told you so
,(But I told you so)
,What you reap
,Is what you sow
,What goes around comes around
,Now you know
,And I hate to say I told you so.
I may come on strong but that's what you like
You like a female MC who can handle the mic
How do I know? Because you told me so
You instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
So that's why I'm here, don't mean to make a case of it
This rap here, well, it's just for the taste of it
I write the rap to make the whole world sing
And I'm the type of female, well, I like to swing
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'

Party people in the place, since you started the case
Of a demonstration, I need concentration
So you can make a full examination
Then you will agree that I'm the best MC
And so is my deejay on the tables, Rock
This is the best jam that you could get
The rap by Lyte and the beat by Stetsa
(Beat by Stetsa, beat by Stetsa)
Never turn it down, 'cause it's what you requested
Any mike I hold, you know the big man pressed it
Sole believer in the rap, I say
You believe it too, that's why you never walk away
You like the way I do it, you like my style
Study me like a book, 'cause you know I'm worth your while
Expressions on my face show you just how I feel
Add a rap to my gestures, now you know the deal
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
MC Lyte likes swingin'
'Cause yo, I am the best and that I'll boast
Sit down and be the guest and I'll be the host
It's wack to those that know and those that do not
Like, Coke is it, I hit the spot
Like 'Good Vibrations', I'm like Sunkist
The rap is smooth, 'cause it's sealed with chapstick
Not gonna say that I been rappin' since the day of birth
But I've acquired the knowledge like Ms. Butterworth
Ask me what's important, I tell you time and effort
Ask me how I do it, it's Lyte's , method yeah
Lyte is good, Bud Lite's good for ya
I'm exciting just like Toyota

,这场进化太突兀
,我从最深的土地底下破壤而出
,亿万年前的光和雾
,如同沉睡了太久的远古生物
,终将撕裂束缚 变成参天树木
,我拖着脚步 刻下一道孤独

,无心唱了 一段华丽的腔
,谁曾听了 为此魂牵梦断
,破开黎明 前夕将死的暗
,喧嚣而至 就如锋锐电光
,眼波流转出世间最澄澈的碧蓝
,暗夜的 妖姬在 荆棘中歌唱
,盘扣交错锁骨间留有一丝遐想
,主人啊 可是你 把我召唤
,不愿你 孤身在夜雾迷航
,用歌声 随你 扬帆劈波斩浪
,千里月 不如你一笑回望
,踏遍千山 何妨
,
,我欲乘风化作一抹月光浸染九州江岸
,携青云 再流连 过你的耳畔
,我欲泊舟伴那一川烟波停靠你的心房
,不眠夜 与你枕 漫天星光
,
,你是 夜行归客 我是 摇曳烛火
,青石 路 上伴 你的 行旅离落
,你是 风烟漠客 我是 斜日长河
,荒野 途 中慰 你的 孤单萧索
,我欲入梦化蝶翩跹过十里云川
,携风月 陪你度 过流年悠长
,我欲高唱把那一庭春色都唱晚
,送与你 才不负 相识一场
,不愿你 孤身在夜雾迷航
,用歌声 随你 扬帆劈波斩浪
,千里月 不如你一笑回望
,踏遍千山 何妨

,一千个 日夜都为你而唱
,用歌声 随你 开辟一片疆场
,倾尽我 余生都念你痴狂

,So we can party like it’s never gonna end
,
,
,
,
,Everytime you say my name
,It feels like a lullaby
,And I go crazy,
,Everybody thinks I'm crazy
,Every single word you spoke
,To make my heavy metal walls broke
,I was so curious, so delirious
,Baby let me tell you I had a plan
,long before you told me you don't wanna come
,Oh yes I do
,I want to run!
,Kiss me under the shadows with a cup of rum
,Uh, take me over
,Take my hand and let's be robbers
,Let's run, all over the city
,Just run run run, like you do all the time
,Oh you burn faster than a hurricane
,You're a hurricane
,Oh you burn faster than a hurricane
,You're a hurricane
,☽
,Everytime you say my name
,It feels like a lullaby
,And I go crazy,
,Everybody thinks I'm crazy
,You told me don't go after two years of waiting
,You said hello, little lady
,I've been praying
,I've been praying
,For you for so long
,I got tired of waiting
,Oh it's finally now
,Tell me to stay and that you want me round
,Why don't we stay like this?
,For a moment we can stay like this
,And love will save you but
,It won't save me no
,Love can save you but
,It will never save me no
,Will save you but
,It won't save me no
,Love can save you but
,It will never save me no
,
,Oh you burn faster than a hurricane
,You're a hurricane
,You're a hurricane
,
,Hide away hide away, hiding from your call
,Found a place, found a place, we could have it all
,But I wish I never followed
, Innocent, innocent Let into the fall
,In the end, innocence, we're not anymore
,And now I’m feeling hallow
,
,I’m finding it hard enough to let go
,Let go, let go
,And now I'm surrounded by your echo
,Echo, Echo
,
,You loved me and then tore me right apart
,Like an animal
,And you keep returning like an echo
,Like an Echo
,
,(Let) Like an Echo
,(Let) Like an Echo
,(Let) Like an Echo
,(Let) Like an Echo
,
,Wondering, wondering, why you keep coming back
,Tempted by, tempted by, what we should've had
,But there's no getting past
,What you did, what you did, thinking I would stay
,Promises, promises, nothing ever changed
,And we were never gonna let
,
,I’m finding it hard enough to let go
,Let go, let go
,And now I'm surrounded by your echo
,Echo, Echo
,
,You loved me and then tore me right apart
,Like an animal
,And you keep returning like an echo
,Like an Echo
,
,You're like heartbreak stuck on repeat
,Like scratches on a CD
,You're like heartbreak stuck on repeat
,Like scratches on a CD
,When you say you need me
,When you say you need me
,When you say you need me
,Please don't say you need me
,
,I’m finding it hard enough to let go
,Let go, let go

Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin gelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high suela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggaz wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'ma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
with a gre-nade, now you flappin, like a mermaid
Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips
while I'm at the bar, baggin, the bartender tips
Then I bag this chick, with a, "Hi," and the eye
She did the butterfly, rubbin her ass, against my buttonfly
I could ALREADY imagine my shit stuck inside
Everytime I strike, haters be like, "Dat fucking guy!"
Chorus: Beatnuts + Yellaklaw
How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dime lo conllo, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)
Nigga whatchu gonna do? (What, yo)
(JuJu)
Here's to my pollyin niggaz who campaign
To the killers who be lovin the chicas and champagne
Thugs who get wild in the club and snatch chains
Players who be pimpin the hoes with no brains
Front watch a nigga get shot from close range
The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin outta here breathin is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin kneepads
Now the beef has, gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs
til both of us said, platinum gettin took this year
Cause for real, there ain't nothin but crooks in here, nigga
Chorus -> Beatnuts last line "Whatcha gon' do when Beatnuts come through baby!"
(Beatnuts)
(Get money, get money) Psycho Les
(Get money, get money) Big Ju
(Get money, get money) Beatnuts
(Get money, get money)
(Get money, get money)
(Get money, get money) Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
(Get money, get money) Throw your hands up, throw your hands up..

This is going out to
The fabulous weeeeze
Come on, hey
(I know what you can do)
(Let us play the part for you)
Are you ready to party?
Yeah, all right
We made the perfect day when
We played the
(Night and sun)
She said she couldn't stay
When her night had just begun
She wanted me to know what
She didn't know herself
Said I was one among others
Hey, now that's something else
She played a vocal mission
I played the cosmic
(Heart)
Wanted to paint her picture
She said, don't even start
She said love's like a drug
And that this was chemistry
But with these chemicals then
How is this good for me?
Her life gets better she read, her
(Man goes out of his head)
Like birds of a feather so we
(Bled?)
Let's go together then she said
So what's the altitude?
I said it's out of sight
What's with the attitude?
And she said it's all right
So what's the altitude?
I said it's out of sight
What's with the attitude?
And she said it's all right
She said let's get away now
Lets go down by the bay now
She turned her
(Hair)
My way now
Watch out, what you say now?
Now the things you've been through
Make it seem like nothing could
Ever really last forever
But if you try, girl, we can do some things
She gave me headphones
Said have you heard this sound?
I think I've heard this one
It's totally underground
And I wouldn't let her go then
She wouldn't let me go
Just ask the neighbors man
It's unbelievable
I played the morning rising
She played the setting sun
She said she couldn't stay
When her night had just begun
So what's the altitude?
I said it's out of sight
What's with the attitude?
And she said it's all right
So what's the altitude?
I said it's out of sight
Without a band and
We dance, we party all night
We party all night
We party all night
We party all night
We made the perfect
(Day)
When we played the
(Night and sun)
She said she couldn't stay
When her night had just begun
She wanted me to know what
She didn't know herself
Said I was one among others
Hey, now that's something else
We played the vocal mission
To play the cosmic
(Style)
How can we make the distance?
You've always known
(By eye)
We're letting people know what
We now know ourselves
Now we are one among others
Hey, now that's something else
She gave me headphones
Said have you heard this sound?
You know I've heard this one, girl
Let's get outta town
This love is like a drug an
We bonded chemically
We're letting you know better
Living through chemistry

What you do, what you say
 Has a lot to do in how you live today
 What you want, and what you make,
 Everybody knows it's only what you take
 What you see, and what you hear,
 When it comes around again it's not too clear
 You say yes, they say no,
 Everybody's talking everywhere you go
You try to give another man a helping hand
 He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
 Never do to others what they do to you
 Try to find another way to make it through
What I say is what I know,
 Try to get a favour going from door to door
 You stop and pray it's out of style,
 You get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
 What I say is what I know
 Try to get a favour going from door to door
 You stop and pray, you know that's out of style,
 Get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
You try to give another man a helping hand
 He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
 Never do to others what they do to you
 You'd better do it to them before they do it to you.
What you do, what you say
 Has a lot to do in how you live today

 Never do to others what they do to you

Big Daddy Kane
It's A Big Daddy Thing
Warm It Up, Kane
Come, get some, you little bum
I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
From the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate - and all that good shit
I'm the original, asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin drama when i'm on the scene
And i pack em in mean, like bruce springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble
And i'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
Your batman and robin, cagney and lacey
Starsky and hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
That's for you not to come near, period
So i ain't buggin or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And i can slice and dice a fisher price mc
That thought he was nice into minute rice
Single-handed, i ain't with that band stuff
Cause cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic i ravage, not like a savage
But in my own way of doin damage
As i design the genuine line
Now who flattop rules in eighty-nine?
Warm it up, kane (16x)
..
Take two other men with soul that you probably know
Deadly as scarface, but bright as the cosby show
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush
They step to me, but can't stop the bumrush
I make material, rich and imperial
The unique technique i speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old, but poppa's got a brand new bag
So put the mic down boy, you can't work it
Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse
You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust
First i caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong my son, so i taught ya
Just like a guardian, that put your body in
The mood to groove with the smoove way that i'm partyin
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like dracula
And waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you booga bear
You start hallucinatin like magic
The wrath gets tragic, but kane won't have it
Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin
Slowed the pace, so i had to start rushin
So pick a vc date, cause you're history
Here comes kane scoob scrap jay and mister cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack, a vision of blur
Just them thinkin i'm competitin, i say, "huh!"
Warm it up, kane (16x)
..
Genuine for eighty-nine, you know what i'm sayin?
As i give a shout out to my man tony a
Tony p, sally sal and the whole libra digital posse
Can't forget my man yawnski
And smooth the barber, you know what i'm sayin?
Also, i gotta say whassup to born true, b-boy,
And my man big jay cee
The whole rest of the crew, scoob lover my brother
Scrap lover, and dj mister cee
Can't forget supreme, abu, melquan and shabazz
Wally d, and the rest of the brothers
And of course my little brother the little daddy shane
Manditory end of the story, you know what i'm sayin?
Peace!

,Only way, I begin to G' off was drug loot
,And let's start it like this son, rollin with this one
,And that one, pullin out gats for fun
,But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
,Started smokin woolies at sixteen
,And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
,Making my way on fire escapes
,No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
,The combination made my eyes bleed
,No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough off
,Sticking up white boys in ball courts
,My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
,Times is rough and tough like leather
,Figured out I went the wrong route
,So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out

,Smokin bones in the staircase
,Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess

California dreamin' 
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I went for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day
I stopped into a church (stopped into a church)
I passed along the way (passed along the way)
You know, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)
Oh, the preacher likes the cold (preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)
Oh, California dreamin' (California dreamin')

All the leaves are brown (the leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey (and the sky is grey)

,I go to work
,Like a doctor
,When I rock the mic
,You got to like
,The way I operate
,I make miracles happen
,Just from rappin
,
,Im so lyrically potent
,And Im flowin
,And explodin
,
,On the scene mean
,I got the potential
,To make you go
,Then chill
,I got the credentials
,That is of which I chose
,To make a rhyme
,And chill
,Then you know
,I will fulfill
,To make a couple of mill
,As I build a guild
,For all the rappers and skills
,And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
,
,Hang em an ephigy
,If hes a sucker
,Hang em to the left of me
,Cause my right hand man
,Is my mic stand and
,The microphone that I own
,And my game plan
,Is keeping at a steady pace
,Aint no need for a rush
,It aint no race
,Ima hit the top
,Just when I wanna
,And its a matter of time
,And Im gonna
,Cause I know when to
,Go head enter
,The classic moe dee rap
,That sent ya
,Runnin around
,Holdin ya head
,Askin ya homeboy
,Yo man
,You hear what he said
,Another funky rhythm
,Look at ya man
,And give him a high five
,Cause Im live
,Runnin around with him
,Telling everybody
,Hanging out on the block
,Its time to wake up
,And check the clock
,Punch it
,
,I go to work
,
,I go to work
,
,I go to work
,
,Like an architect
,I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
,Skyscrapers look like atoms
,Cars electrons rollin in patterns
,Writing out word after word
,With each letter it becomes visably better
,
,Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
,And after I came off vaction
,I came to roam
,The land I own
,And stand alone on the microphone
,Daddys home
,Open the door playtime is over
,
,Time to go to work and show the
,Suckers in the place who run their face
,The base and a taste of whos the ace
,Start the race
,Im coming in first
,With each verse
,I build a curse
,So rappers cant capture moe dees rapture
,After I got ya
,
,I have to slap ya
,Senseless with
,Endless rhymes dont pretned this
,Is anything short of stupendous
,And when this rhyme is done
,Your mind will become
,So trapped in the rap
,Youll lust on another one
,You gotta wait it takes time
,I dont write I build a rhyme
,I draw plans draft the diagrams
,
,An architect in effect
,And it slams
,And if its weak when Im done
,
,Renovate and build another one
,I go to work
,
,I go to work
,
,I go to work
,Like a boxer
,Train the brain and aim
,To out fox ya
,Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
,Some times it rocks ya
,So hard it stops ya
,Dead in your tracks
,So power packed
,Before you can react
,Youre flat on your back
,Down for the count
,Get up and dismount
,Cause Im coming
,With an endless amount
,Of words in a hurry
,Like a flurry
,A collage to camouflage
,The power punch but dont worry
,Knowledge is an antidote
,I got hand of smoke
,Writing at the speed of light with insight
,I wrote
,Rhymes at a level
,So you cant relate
,Unless youre intelligent
,So stay awake
,Sleepwalkers
,Slick talkers
,
,This time a native new yorkers
,Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
,State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
,Rhymes in its highest form
,Im a drop it on ya like a bomb
,When it explodes Ill blow up
,A few casualties but so what
,If youre slow
,
,You blow
,You know you go
,I flow
,I throw all pro
,
,I go to work
,
,To say rap is not work
,Is ludicrous
,Whoever said it
,Must be new to this
,When you hear me
,Youll compare me
,To a prophet for profit
,Not merely
,Putting words together for
,Recreation
,Each rhymes a dissertation
,
,You wanna know my occupation
,I get paid to rock the nation
,I go to work
,
,I go to work
,
,I go to work

â€~Cause nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
I was delayed, I was waylaid
An emergency stop, I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder, yeah
Who said lied I'd to her?
Who said I'd lied? â€~Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
Broke my knee and broke my spleen
And then he really laid into me, yeah
Friday night in Out-Patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Who said I'd lied? â€~Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied to her?
So I drank one, it became four
And when I fell on the floor I drank more
Stop me, oh oh-oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh I said, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
â€~Cause nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
Set me free, why don't you?
Get out my life, why don't you?
â€~Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on
Set me free, why don't you girl?
Get out my life, why don't you baby?
â€~Cause you don't really love me, no no no
You just keep my hanging on

What the hell look at what we’re doing here
We bite our tongues till they bleed
You lean in close whisper something in my ear
Are you just too ashamed or scared of the flame between us
 
I know everything you are but now you're moving way too far
If you love me like I love, would the miles still you're between us?
If you want it we could have it, would you give all that it takes? 

Hook (If you love me... If you want me....)

It’s plain to see our differences are showing 
But we always said we don’t wanna be the same nooooooo
You said let’s take our time, our feelings are still growing 
Well that’s just fine by me, but your playin' a different game yeahh
 
I know everything you are but now you're moving way too far

,Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
,I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m okay
,Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
,But I hope I never see them again
,I know it breaks your heart
,Moved to the city in a broke down car
,And four years, no calls
,Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
,And I can't stop, no, I can’t stop
,
,So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
,That I know you can't afford
,Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
,Pull the sheets right off the corner
,Of the mattress that you stole
,From your roommate back in Boulder
,We ain't ever getting older
