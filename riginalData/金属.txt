,So who's left to count the cost?
,Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost.
,Now we're gone,left without a trace,
,but we took something they cannot replace.
,A match made in heaven,
,paved the road to hell.
,We've been down this path before.
,Cold blooded retribution.
,So fuck your revolution.
,You chew up peace and spit it out as war.
,You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door.
,You are rotten to the core.
,We found your fingerprints all over the trigger.
,If you're looking for tyrants,take a look in the mirror.
,You knew all along,that the cancer would spread,
,so don't be surprised to find a price on your head.
,Sorry son,but we destoryed your home,
,we murdered your family,now you're on your own.
,Collateral damage,face down in the sand.
,Watch the dominoes fall,it's all just part of the plan.
,A match made in heaven.
,Paved the road to hell.
,We've been down this path before.
,Cold blooded retribution.
,So fuck your revolution.
,A match made in heaven.
,Paved the road to hell.
,We've been down this path before.
,And every execution,the price of your collusion.
,You knew all along,that the cancer would spread,
,so don't be surprised to find a price on your head.
,Tell me was it all worth it,to watch your kingdom grow?
,All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low.
,Sunk this low.
,You are rotten to the core.
,You are rotten to the core.
,You are rotten to the core.
,You are rotten to the core.

Evolution is a mystery
A small change that no one sees.
Clock makes a fool of history .
Yesterday's so long ago, don't agree with what I know .
Tomorrow becomes a place to be.
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOLUTION
See my reflection change.
Nothing ever stays the same
But you know the name's the game.
We all know what it means
Nothings ever what it seems
Unforgiven
Unforseen
I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Looking back to see where I stand.
EVOLUTION EVOULTION

Ain't got no knife
But don't you start no fight

T.N.T. and i'll win the fight
T.N.T. i'm a power load
T.N.T. watch me explode
I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
Don't you mess me 'round

You spoon fed us Saturday morning mouthfuls of maggots and lies
Disguised in your sugary breakfast cereals
The plates you made us clean were filled with your fears
These things have hardened in our soft pink bellies
We are what you have made us
We have grown up watching your television
We are a symptom of your Christian America the biggest Satan of all
This is your world in which we grow and we will grow to hate you
Hallelujah, motherfuckers
I eat innocent meat, the housewife I will beat
The pro-life I will kill, what you won't do I will

Revelation #9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interview with pogo in Gaston Gazette Dec. 4, '95
D.S.: How much stuff on Revelation #9 is backwards?
Pogo: Well, there are 13 exact tracks on Revelation #9, it consists of 13 
tracks in which at least 6 are reversed.
D.S.: When we played it backwards, we heard things like \"Welcome to the other 
side\"
Pogo: Oh yeah, there is all kinds of fan stuff on there, it's playable in any 
direction. It is equally playable in any direction. It has an equal number of 
tracks in each direction.

We are our own wicked gods
With little \"g's\" and big dicks
Constantly inflicting a slow demise
Sadistic stick it to my ribs
I'll spread me open
We try to die
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
We run like roaches
I know your poison in our space we'll... lie
To an obscene god we will dance and spit you hear boy?
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here
You're on the other side now
There ain't no going back now
Don't tell your momma that I brought you here boy!
'Cause there ain't no going back

Jesus loves the little children of the world
All the Christian soldiers marching in the cold...
Wear the cross of Jesus while marching on and on...
Don't you tell your mamma that I came here and I put this in you!
Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you tell your mamma! Don't you!

There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're going or which way the wind is blowing
Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a-blowing?
Not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing
Hey Jew, let me thank you for wasting our time! Fuck your time! Asshole!
Fuck your shit, you fucking... Shit! Fucking ho! Fucking ho! Come on, rape her! 
Get her!
Manson has probably killed the pigs without the gang!
Where the fuck's the sausage?
Where the fuck's the sausage?
Every mother...
Hallelujah, motherfucker! Hallelujah!
Goddamn millionaire! Goddamn millionaire!
Son of a bitch!

,What do we do now, Sheriff？
,Now...We RIDE!
Falling from the sky now, a sign of the burning sun
Into the face of the evil one
Nowhere to hide now we＇re on the run right before your eyes
We＇re watching, we＇re waiting, our souls are forsaking
The sign of the warriors, where we will arise
Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
Into the night we go
Time to pay, time of the slain
Such as the death we know
Our steel will shine forever through the dark and falling rain!
We＇ll see them face their fears; it＇s time to rise again in everlasting pain
Fly free for what we believe
One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
Feel me the judgement of me
So silently now they will heal - cry for eternity
See now the fallen are new again,
We feel the pain burn inside their head,
Remember now what to be again, deep down inside
Still cursing, still crawling, we抮e endlessly falling
The downfall of mankind, the fate of the sun
Hold your head to the sky, bleeding we cry
Screaming into the night
Fire and pain, beginning again,
Onwards to help me now!
Stand strong we＇ll live forever
Raging through the barren lands
Our eyes have seen the sorrow
Far across the stars, the power in our hearts
CHORUS
Fly far away to the end of our days
The voices of long distant cries
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
And so we ride into the night
,
,Flying over darkened skies the battle will call
,Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
,And the world falls under the starlight shining from heavens below
,
,Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more
,Cry for the touch of angels never before
,And the stars fall on the horizon onwards and up through the pain
,
,Ride the wind and fight the demon steel shining bright
,Standing together forever onwards flames burning strong
,Hot wind in Hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards
,We stare into the dawn of a new world
,
,Cry out for the fallen heroes lost in time ago
,In our minds they still belong
,when the sands of time are gone
,
,Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
,Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
,Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
,On towards the gates of reason
,Fight for the truth and the freedom
,Gloria
,
,
,Searching through the memories to open the door
,Living on the edge of life like never before
,And the ground chants under the moonlight facing their fears all the same
,
,Heaven's fear now open wide and up for the call
,All in stark reality the angels will fall
,And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown

,Blinded by the force of evil cries into the night
,Never before have they seen the darkness now they're all gone
,Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
,Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn

,Hold on for the morning after
,Never to let go
,In the fires burning strong
,When the tides of time roll on
,Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
,Crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
,Far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
,On towards the gates of reason
,Fight for the truth and the freedom
,Gloria

作曲 : Hanneman, King
(lyrics - king, music - hanneman, king)
Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine, infest my corpse to be
Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Invasions quickly override, malicious domineering strike
Flood your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met
Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic, permanent disease
(lead: hanneman)
Incapacitate, fall into your fate
Pain results in screams, bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured
(lead: king)
,Modulistic terror
,A vast sadistic feast
,The only way to exit
,Is going piece by piece
,You have no choice of life or death
,My face you will not see
,I＇ll rip your flesh ＇till there＇s no breath
,Dismembered destiny
,As soon as life has left your corpse
,I＇ll make you part of me
,No emotion
,Death is all I see
,Modulistic terror
,A vast sadistic feast
,The only way to exit
,Is going piece by piece
,Bones and blood lie on the ground
,Rotten limbs lie dead
,Decapitated bodies found
,On my wall, your head!
,On your trail I close the gap
,One more life that soon won＇t be
,No emotion
,Your flesh is all I need
,I＇ll send you to your maker
,Confront the God you seek
,A flash of red upon your chest
,Safety out of reach
,You have no choice of life or death
,My face you will not see
,I＇ll rip your flesh ＇till there＇s no breath
,Dismembered destiny
,Modulistic terror
,A vast sadistic feast
,There＇s only one way out of here
,Piece by piece

,Night will come,and I will follow
,For my victoms,there's no tomorrow
,Make it fast,your time of sorrow
,On his trail,I'll make you follow
,Quarters for the criminally insane
,The sentence for life I must remain
,The path I chose has led me to my grave
,To try again I'd have no other way
,Quarters for the criminally insane
,Escape for me has fast become a game
,Soon to be,I'll leave without a trace

,You go to the church,you kiss the cross
,You will be saved by any cost
,You have your own reality:Christianity!
,You spend your life just kissing ass
,A trait that's grown as time has passed
,You think the world will be end today
,You praise the Lord,it's all you say:
,"Jesus saves!"
,Listen to you pray
,You think you'll see the pearly gates when death takes you away
,For all respect,you cannot lust
,In an invisible man you place your trust
,Indirect dependency
,Eternal attempt at amnesty
,He will decide who lives and dies
,Depopulate Satan's rise
,You will be an accessory
,Irreverence and blasphemy
,Jesus saves!
,No need to pay
,The gates of pearl have turned to gold
,It seems you've lost your way!
,Jesus saves!
,No words of praise
,No promised land to take you to

,On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
,In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
,And the darkness is falling down and the times are tough all right
,The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
,
,Fighting high, fighting on for the steel
,Through the wastelands evermore
,The scattered souls will feel the hell that is wasted on the shores
,On the blackest waves in history
,We watch them as they go
,Through fire, pain and once again we know
,So now we fly ever free
,We're free before the thunderstorm
,On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
,Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
,Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
,So far away we wait for the day
,For the lights are so wasted and gone
,We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
,Through the fire and the flames we carry on
,
,As the red day is dawning
,And the lightning cracks the sky
,They raise their hands to the heavens above
,As we send them to their lies
,Running back through the mid-morning light
,There's a burning in my heart
,We're banished from the time in the fallen land
,To a light beyond the stars
,In the blackest dreams we do believe
,Our destiny this time
,And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
,And on the wings of a dream
,So far beyond reality
,All alone in desperation
,Now the time is gone
,Lost inside you'll never find
,Lost within my own mind
,Day after day this misery must go on
,So far away we wait for the day
,For the lights are so wasted and gone
,We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
,Through the fire and the flames we carry on
,
,
,
,Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
,We've fought so hard now can we understand?
,I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
,For freedom of every man
,So far away we wait for the day
,For the lights are so wasted and gone
,We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
,Through the fire and the flames we carry on

, The last spoken will of a warrior King:
, "Bury me next to my soldiers
, Set my horse free and let people sing
, Of their son with the world on his shoulders
, Then look to the mountains
, I left my grave wide open."
, Eyes fixed on the mountain
, "I was buried at dusk, at dawn I return."
, Here it comes
, Death undone
, King after King
, From this tomb we shall build you a throne
, In your name we shall sing
, Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
, Long live the King!
,
, The heart of a King can be measured in dreams
, Reaching the sleep of his people
, A whisper of ghost saying we'll be redeemed
, From our sins he will build us a castle
, One day we'll be stronger, we will ride right beside you
, Until we are stronger, we put stone upon stone
, Await your return
, From this tomb we shall build you a throne
, In your name we shall sing
, Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
, Long live the King!
,
, The longing for sun and a heartbreak undone
, Breaking the back of false idols
, Bring our King home, for among us are none
, Who is worthy to be his disciple
, Out there in the wasteland, there's something coming for us
, A call from the wasteland:
, He was buried at dusk, at dawn he returns
, Here it comes
, Death undone
, King after King
, From this tomb we shall build you a throne
, In your name we shall sing
, Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
, Long live the King!

, As the river flows from afar
, No matter how much you try to drain it
, Hunger makes the stars wander on
, Your place is to grow what shall feed them
,
, As the anger grows in your heart
, No matter how much you try to deny it
, Hunger makes his people go on
, Our place is to grow what shall feed them
, Rain is falling on the fields
, They grow on me
, Reach towards the sun
, One day you will join the soil
, But first we grow
, My field
, My seeds
, I am the harvest
, As the gods all watch as we craw
, No matter what we will stand by our master
, Our cradles and our graves under stones
, Dug up by fathers resting beneath us
, Rain is falling on the fields
, They grow on me
, Reach towards the sun
, One day you will join the soil
, But first we grow
, My field
, My seeds
, I am the harvest
,
, As I lift this child from the ground
, No matter how long it takes, he's returning
, Our destiny is written in dirt
, Nurtured by mothers raised by the seasons
, Rain is falling on the fields
, They grow on me
, Reach towards the sun
, One day you will join the soil
, But first we grow
, My field
, My seeds
, I am the harvest

, From the innermost sanctum
, Of the secret halls
, A drum is pounding
, Calling you home
, Call upon all who’ve heard his voice
,
, Come and see the spectacle
, A sight you won't believe
, Chaos in the cosmos
, This is your destiny
, To the stars, we take off
, Reach out and touch the night
, Soldiers forged in metal
, My king, I’ve seen the light
, Engines set to battle
, Let’s go, I’m not afraid
, Come to me, destruction
, And come whatever way
, I have roamed the planet
, But I shall search no more
, Raise the flag in victory
, What are you waiting for?
,
, From eons long forgotten
, Until the end of all
, Unborn, undead, eternal
, Upon his throne
, Spread your wings of flame and sorrow
, Time to rise for our tale has just begun
, Take this land as your loved one
, You were born a legend
,
, Fear of life takes hold of you
, Let go and come with me
, I have heard his promise
, And what you need to be
, Lord beyond the darkness
, Uncovering your third eye
, Forging righteous weaponry
, We’ll fight, live free, and die
, From eons long forgotten
, Until the end of all
, Unborn, undead, eternal
, Upon his throne
, Spread your wings of flame and sorrow
, Time to rise for our tale has just begun
, Take this land as your loved one
, You were born a legend
,
, Spread your wings of flame and sorrow
, Time to rise for our tale has just begun
, Take this land as your loved one
, You are born again
, Brother, take your given share
, There are no strangers here
, Celebrate your rebirth
, Ignite the atmosphere
, Kneel and swear on your soul
, Allegiance to the crown
, Stand up knighted by his sword
, The secret drum still pounds
, Spread your wings of flame and sorrow
, Time to rise for our tale has just begun
, Take this land as your loved one
, You were born a legend

I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
This will not be the place for my tomb
Can you save my life?
There's no way
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
What can we do when we are lost
When we are lost
I can't see nothing with my blind eye
Hey, where is my god?
I can't see a sign that leads my heart
Hey, where did you go?
There's nothing that I can do 
Without you here
Here the sun rise, the moon doesn't shine
I want to find the way
I can't die in this place
*Let me see, let me see the light
Let me make it right
Let me see the light
This will not end like this*
I'm lost
Take me back home
I will never come back to this place

,Death be not proud
,though some have called me mighty and dreadful
,thou art not so
,Loosing the war I am feining to win
,though I never tried to to strive deep
,from within. Life could be beautiful
,for anybody it is for,
,The portal has been past
,to follow the reaper
,When your blindly death-raying blade
,sweeps the griefs and fears away.
,I cross my heart
,I cross my heart
,Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
,Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-reliefing potion.
,But after all, that got boring too,
,so no matter,what happens, I could not give a damn or too.
,The portal has been past til the point of no return.
,No more lines to cross,
,no bridges to burn.
,Now when your blindly death-raying blade
,swept my griefs and tears away.
,I would never go back to cross that line.
,I cross my heart and hope to die.
,speaking  I was only 21 when I died.
Starving out the many while I only feed the few
Maintain the wealth that keeps me in control of you
Clean on the surface so you won't see my deceit
Even though I'm slithering just beneath your feet
Extend my reign into foreign lands
Flexing my muscle anywhere I can
I keep the power and swallow you whole
Cutting off your life support, I follow through
From way up here my vision's distorted
Cannot maintain what I once supported
I keep you safe, secure and protected
Until my self-indulgence has been perfected
I am the state
I decide your fate
Deliver to all
I bring the downfall
Making up your mind is everything I do
Doing the right thing is never up to you
Get you on board only to betray your trust
I will cut you off when I say you've had enough

Calling for me
the urge to force a large knife through your skin and insert it again and 
again
just to see your blood smeared on your face
and then splattered on me
haunted, haunted
I begin to see
Why I need to kill
my lust for your pain
is my reason to be
slicing your veins,
feeling your blood spray
all over my face
scream for me
I have to kill you to fulfil my needs
Reduce your form to a vomitous mass
Carnage and entrails all over
I force your corpse to bend over
now my urge has tripled
I have to feel you on me
dead fuck me!
I had to kill you to fulfil my needs
Now I must fuck you to enhance the deed
Blood smeared on my hard cock
then smeared on your ass
reduce your form to a vomitous mass
I cum on your face
spew my tainted seed
Rub it on your fuckin' tits
you whore you died for me
I think I like how you please me
Now that your a gory fuckin' mess
i'll keep your carcass ready for a fuck
anytime I feel you next to me 

Claiming my next victim for a filthy feast
Nauseating hunger for human feces
These lesion ridden cunts mean nothing to me
But their bowels possess the key to my nourishment
Unhealthy hunger escalating from the stench fortified fudge packed full of
nutrients
Sexually abusing nursing home patients as they shit themselves I gorge on
the caustic mess
Violently consuming shit
Pulverizing my fist in your fuckin' face
Postmortally I feast on the wastes of the fuckin' elderly
Crusty fuckin' filthy beings, consuming their contaminants
undying love for the blackened fluids of stiffs boiling blood and brains of
my victims bleed.
Necrocopromaniac, pestilential being
The sight of feces rockets me into a fuckin' frenzy
Haemorrhoidal veins rupture slick secretions
upon my tongue, sanguinary analingus
sucking on their cunts till they burst
How I love it when they bleed on me
Fist fucking diseased anal cavities
plunging blades into their skin till they've died
skin desclamates and slips right the fuck off of your bones
feeling no regard for the lives of these handicapped fucks
these hundred year old pigs produce my reward, their bodily wastes
Killing is what keeps me sane
so I think ill just rip your fucking head clean off
Coprophagia
I kill motherfuckers everyday
let these hordes of dead fucks unite
To mutilate the human species,
I take pride in killing nothing will ever stop me
from fucking murdering upheaving these human stockpiles of brown sediment
extremely aroused by the sight of fucking pain masturbating feverishly to
the rhythm of their prayers
cumming on their infected bed sores
rectally bleeding I sodomize the elderly
spewing rapidly a bed pan bon-appetite
despoiling, despoilment
raping these elderly pieces of shit
while slobbering sewage how sweet it is
toothless and sick swallowing cum
my blistering pecker seeps
plunging my vile uncircumcised dick enter the Alzheimer's wound
now my dicks wrapped with disease what the fuck???
my cock now bleeds haemorrhaging,
blood drips on my feet sticking to your encrusted sheets wallowing in pools
of steaming shit
inhaling the stench of filthiness bleed for me terrorizing me
the elderly have turned against me slowly they creep to me
like filthy zombies old bitches sliding sewing needles in my dick
scraping at my bowels
smearing shit on their dirty clits chewing on my filthy meat within
lacerating every inch of my flesh
bleeding slow, my body bloats
pulverizing their fists in my fuckin' face.
Creeping through the dark streets
enter the morgue with a hunger for meat
fuck the newly deceased I need the ones that been dead for ten weeks
Tearing and gashing a limbless torso
Voraciously stuffing my face with grey flesh
The next victim of aids this feast will be held indiscriminately
Moving from corpse to corpse puncturing
Violently, biting, chomping, gnawing on filthy meat
gore soaked, drooling pus, satisfied but not content. To my delight I find
and infant corpse without a head.
I begin to feel bile collect in my throat
this liquid filled infant is sure to please me.
I thrust my red knife in its half decayed chest
I'll begin with the heart then devour the rest.
Coughing up rancid pieces of meat
pus drip my hose I start to feel weak
I proceed to vomit this gut-wrenching feast
My insides along with the festering meat
A chunk of intestine lodged in my throat
I slice my own neck as I start to choke my stomach and vessels seep from my
neck
blood pours from my face as I approach death
Blood churning out of my face
and spilling on the floor.
The pain intense yet, I still hunger for more
As I fall dying I grab handfuls of tainted meat
I must gorge engorge these putrid steaming
mounds of flesh
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
Choking, on the flesh, of the dead, Insanity is my disease!
I lie dead amongst carnage
but this feast isn't complete
the vermin and maggots
will consume what's left of me
rats gnawing, bugs crawling
my dirty flesh is the feast
these insects and rats will reduce me to bones.
My mind is as rotten as the bodies of the fuckin' whores I've killed.
I raid a fresh grave to satisfy my thrills.
What the fuck is this?
A filthy fuckin' ugly bitch, I must rip the head clean off this scabby dead
trick
Now I rip the thread from her lips, bugs exit from her pale face
I jam my prick in her mouth and then I spin her head around, unburied
I gaze at her body mutilated but not by my hands stab wounds from a prior
predator but the job is not yet done
Now I will get the sloppy seconds of this rancid slut
I fuck the fuckin' shit out of her filthy neck
fluids from her stiff vagina seep
parasites proceed to enter my pulsing pecker
gnawing their way through me
hundreds of maggots nesting in my nutsack
horrible hybrid from the unseen
how will I rid myself of these filthy scum guppies
fuck this crude larvae
Pissing blood and pieces of meat
A small price to pay for my crimes
Tickling from my dick into my own hand
I tilt my head back, feel it oozing down my throat
she agrees to fuck me before I take her life
so I proceed to penetrate her twat till it bleeds
her screams of pain turn into moans of pleasure
so I punch her in the mouth but she begs me for more
As I pound at her blood soaked slit
she begs me to deliver my seed
>From my red cock the scavengers seep
in the womb grows my young offspring
Tortured and defiled as I impregnate
Embodied in my victim hate bred spawn
nine months newborn, enraged angered
inhuman infant of my incarnation
Countless corpses litter the streets
there's not stopping my sick offspring
surviving chiefly on humans, herds of dead cadavers rotting stripping the
hides from the living, hideous beyond conception
widespread murder rape breeds sickness
man is the endangered species
  Scream inducing pain torments me 
 from beneath my skin 
 Torturous jolts like needles 
 piercing my intestines 
 I must release these vile insects 
 from inside of me 
 With mighty force I plunge it in to 
 eradicate the source of pain 
 
 Now the pain has tripled 
 yet I begin to feel bliss 
 Perhaps these insects were 
 a trick played in my mind 
 The more pain, the more pleasure 
 I start to become aroused 
 blood drains from my veins 
 I reach in and pull my guts out 
 
 My cock is fully aroused 
 I wrap my intestines around it 
 slowly I begin to jerk 
 pleasure unlike I've ever felt 
 My hand and my pulse move faster 
 With my free hand I scrape out my insides 
 I know this will cause my demise 
 But ill die with cum on my hands 
 
 With fiendish delight 
 I spew a load unlike I've ever seen 
 But I still breathe and feel and uncanny energy 
 Proceeding to consume these cum stained guts 
 now makes sense to me. 
 With lustful force I stuff the steaming mess inside my face 
 The taste of my cum stained guts is as heavenly as when I came 
 
 Now I'm full and just came, 
 there's only one thing to do 
 I thrust out the knife and slice the shit out of myself 
 Slash my neck, carve out my chest 
 then force it into my ass 
 And to complete this carnage 
 I slice off my gore soaked dick 

I'm sick of looking at these filthy ass fucking slobs
I need some slit to satisfy my dirty cock and if these pigs don't give it up
ill have to get my knife
Or stick a glock to their temple and say "give yourself to me" These urges
are controlling me
I need a cunt around my dick
I need fresh blood
The voices tell me to kill
I creep in search of victims for my lustful needs
I find one and stab her repeatedly
Then drag the blood soaked victim deep into the woods I strip her, no' one
hears her screams
I beat her, I smash my fist in her face
Please kill me she says while breathing her last breath
I clutch my blade with all my might, stab her in the fucking guts
Now the fuckin' fun will begin
I slide my hard cock right in
What a feeling it is
to feel her still warm dead skin
Her limp body still bleeds profusely
with my knife I slice her pretty face,
I cant stop laughing.
My blood drenched cock is pounding so hard
It tears up the skin on my dick
Now my blood is mixed in with this fuckin' filthy diseased dead bitch
I breathe heavy, mouth is open
By mistake I swallow blood, I have an idea
The blood gave me a jolt of new pleasure (in this blood)
I then take a chunk from her face and tear skin exposing bone (her skin
ripping)
Chunks dripping from my chin
I will eat her cunt next
Spread open your legs (x2)
I slide in my wet blade
My dick is so hard my skin is ripping
Her blood sprays in the air like a fountain
Never in my life have I felt such pleasure
My heart is pounding
Killing is what I'm made for
Now I am full, another idea
I must take shit on this fuckin' bitch
I let one fly onto her face
I then lean down and kiss this bitch
The smell is insane, shit flows in my veins
It matters not, my cock is now hard again
I jerk off with shit on my hands
Lust still fills me, in time ill do this again
Again I must kill again (x4)
Scum fucking bitch, cum guzzling whore
eating the dick like a revolving door
you suck on my cock but don't swallow shit
your nothing but a worthless ass bitch
So you've been raped, beaten and stabbed
Body contorts, rip you in half
I defecate on your blood splattered mass
Defiling the corpse, suffer in death
Evisceration - rape the bloody whore
Ripped up body - now I crave for more
Endless suffering - I will rape you in the ass
Skin forsaken, bruised and naked
My hands are shaking, I will kill again
Stalking the dark shroud of night
to claim a victim for my crypt
severed heads decorate the lair
which I'm on with sin
Grinding chunks of flesh into
a red and meaty paste
Feasting on these bitches pieces
soothes my minds decay
Come unto me objects of mindlessness,
torture's too good for you
Come unto me objects of mindlessness,
torture's too good for you
Come unto me objects of mindlessness,
torture's too good for you
Read into my ghastly deeds
and encounter sickness
slaughter of disease filled whores
Filth this world don't need.

Here I come
They call me
A beast like none before
I suck the abscess of dead infants
I want some more
I Am Baby Killer
I kill pregnant sluts and whores!!
Splaying inside the womb
Red and wet I tear chunks from the pussy Red and wet mangled unborn baby
Eat the meat dripping from filthy...
Cumstained, blood-soaked, rotten cunt Infant skull exploding in my mouth
It's brain on the floor
I grab it's tongue and tear it out
Dead meat for me. I can't believe
How much this baby is bleeding
It's tiny stumps pours out more
Than it's dead mothers open sores
It's guts paint the floor
It's flesh I shall gorge.
It seems feasting on young infant flesh has made my semen leak.
I am aroused. Fuck I'm crazy
I fuck the blood. I need meat on my cock.
No meat can satisfy me. I must spew my seed
Spunk flows throughout the mangled infant. now I'll chop it up
Chunks of guts fly as i stand with baby skin all over me
Forcing the blood-soaked gore unmercifully down my throat
Pieces of baby are lodged inside of me
Over and over I feast on it's death
It's all gone. I want some more
I turn to it's mother
Blood is still flowing strongly from her butchered pussy
I drink from her fountain, stench of menstrual gore
Gagging on chunks of sliced up pussy
I feel pressure....
Pushing in my brain
The force caves in my head
My eyes eject slowly
Where's my knife?
I plunge my knife in
Inside my head
My veins are seeping
Warm streams of red
My tongue tastes so horrid
I must swallow it
Gore taste so scrumptious
Enough to wash it down with piss. 

Depths of defamation,
Disseminating deception
Imperative formation for an
Impending discern
Bound on an embedding of her
Own severed limbs
A defiled, naked, limbless torso.
Bearing no human resemblance
Through stale eyes she stares
Mesmerized by sight of a crippling onset.
Infectious veiled sacs begin to spill
Revealing the foreseen abscess of life
Her esophagous, scabbed, and now
Beginning to fill
The lacerations from my blood-soaked knife
Gorging on the remains of her own bitter end
So livid, so vile, internally infectious
As deep as any burial infesting within.
Scrutiniously scraping at repulsive wet meat
Strips of flayed flesh dress my taste
For redemption
A scourging recital devised amidst
The shoulders
Of this immense impulsion, stuffing
Her slit-throat
With her repugnant last feast
Regurgitated consumption of
Inherent iniquity
Digesting, consentually divesting
Perpetually rendering, force-fed, her
Own intestines
Clumps of undigestable, intestinal pieces
Immersed in pools of laryngeal lesions
Absorbing befouled sanguine fluid
This fluent so foul, forcing ingestment.

Accept the serum, let it take effect
Close your eyes this will all end soon
We're here to instigate the cataclysm
With the soul objective to harvest
Defiling Earth with catastrophe
Initiating our lethal foray
Purging the existence of all species encountered
Our tactics, elaborate. Our mindset, relentless.
Spawned in this realm to demand it as our new dynasty
We will no leave until the deed is done
Our true form finally revealed
Panic ensues accept us as your new overlords
Anxiously awaiting we ingest human life forces and imitate their form
Loved ones transformed by bacterium
Faces mutating, flesh diffusing
We will suck this planet fucking dry
Devastation at its finest
Exhausting Earth's resources, watching it disintegrate behind us
Exhausting Earth's resources, watching is disintegrate behind us

Kill every human on this Earth
We have been complacent for far too long, time is up
Ancient man considered us their masters
Refuse to comply you will meet your end
Humans can't fathom our animosity
Jaw clasp to delicate limbs, blood fills the mouth
The entrails of those harvested marks the dawn of a new galactic cleansing
We are the end of the organism, the embodiment of all torment
We are what a black whole fears, an ancient adversary that's awoken
Warp the mind, deranged thoughts, erratic massacre begins
An army genetically engineered with one goal in mind
Lay waste to the filth the resides here, a genocidal epidemic
Introduced, families fragmented before their very eyes
Colonize this barren surface begin anew

Inducing fear
Into prosaic minds that do now believe in me
Spewing forth acidic fluids
Gruesome blisters rupture
Beneath the epidermis lies, Labyrinths of organs ripping apart
Returned to the proper home
As their corpses putrefy
Crumbling human forms
We extract, and feast upon their bowels

Crumbling human forms

We extract, and feast upon their ******* bowels
Repulsed by the stench of ignorance
We will stain your planet bright red
******* your world, home of vermin
Thrive on uncertainty of your existence
No soul will escape our grasp
Appendages removed, we look and smile
You are so easily deconstructed
Thrive on uncertainty of your existence
No soul will escape our grasp
Abandon all your ******* hope
For there is no one, watching over you

This is the path you will be subject to follow
Burrowing into the mind, I ever approach to eviscerate such filth
Manifesting beneath skin to dwell within luscious organs
Rewriting the human code
Recreate the era of an ancient civilization
All of life, these merciless forms consume your world
Recreate the era of an ancient civilization
All of life, these merciless forms consume your...
Darkness surrounds your privileged Earth
You are helpless in the eyes of the unknown
Devastation will hail down from the stars
As our crafts descend upon your terrain
Upon your terrain
Abducting everything in sight
Failure to succumb to my being, we will infest your soul
Extract the life
Reanimate these corpses to wage war on those who disobey
Faces are imploding, blood vessels are exploding
All you can see is death in their eyes
Enigmatic forms consume their hearts
Craving, anxiously awaiting the next chance there is to feast
We have claimed this race
The abomination of evil has arrived
And thus, they perish
Winds carry what has transpired to the ears of those enslaved
Let this storm of apocalyptic chaos rain over your insignificant home
Publicly executed for the people who are left to observe
Dispersed throughout the plain creating mountains of corpses
An experiment your lives have become
The extinction of the human scum is now
Run

Communication disrupted, scramble to the streets now fleeing like cowards
Mortals encased by an unworldly bacterium
Abruptly the heavens divide, and a portal appears
Families abducted, anatomy examined from the core
Strategically peeling all the arteries
Observing the effects deliberately
Strategically peeling all the arteries
Observing the effects deliberately
The instruments used now brandished in blood
Demons of this alien race now rise and conquer
Those who lie above the waste are scattered and ensnared
Bones will now be liquified as saliva dissolves
To quench the thirst that provoked this deadly encounter
A horrific display of carnage
Those who survive, transported to our realm
Communication disrupted, scramble to the streets now fleeing like cowards
Mortals encased by an unworldly bacterium
Abruptly the heavens divide, and a portal appears
Families abducted, anatomy examined from the core

Civilization now staring at the face of calamity
We will etch our presence into your bones
Ultra terrestrials flooding the sky
Inferior minds can no longer comprehend
The reality, the vision of the Hyperforms has been revealed
Perspective will never be the same
All left of life now in the presence of the Gods
This species is doomed, there is no hope for the future
This species is doomed, there is no hope for the...
Mankind has failed for the last time
Years of negligence accountable for it's demise
The chance to wake up, now is lost forever
Forever
Undeserving creatures scramble to protect their lives from us now
No way to fight all the pain, teeth grinding away
We've made our efforts to condone
The blueprint of the human body manipulated to suffer
Staring at the heavens for hope, only to see their final fate
Hysterical cries are heard as the hole of eternal darkness draws near
Ultra terrestrials flooding the sky
Inferior minds can no longer comprehend
The reality, the vision of the Hyperforms has been revealed
Perspective will never be the same
There is no escape from extinction
Our universe now a cosmic tundra
A cold wasteland remains, void of all fucking life
Void of all life

,Anti-Flag The Press Corpse Lyrics
,The (Downing Street) memo says...
,...We gotta work to make the facts fit
,the false charges
,Pull the wool over the eyes of
,the filthy masses
,Stab the people in the back for
,the corporate choice
,Roll the propaganda out using
,The People's Voice
,We don't want to talk about it...
,The press scribble scribble
,every half-truth spoke
,Then shoot it round the country
,like an April Fools joke
,Hype the nation
,for a Desert Storm love affair
,Wave the stars and stripes
,like you just don't care!
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,And on the TV screen...
,...Diversion and aversion
,is the flavor of the day
,Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
,Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
,The White House Press Corpse
,only has one thing to say...
,"We don't want to talk about it!"
,The White House boils over
,"Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
,The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing
,the White House song
,While over in Iraq thousands
,are dead because of lies
,The spineless war
,drumming-press corpse have taken lives
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,
,Fires fueled on endless lies
,Black shrouds coat desert skies
,A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
,As embeds report what they're fed
,
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it

I've nothing in common with you!
My inner self, an emptiness
Nothing is important!
Nothing cares!
I'm alone between the masses
I'm an actor in their world.
I play a role.
For what?
To be?
To be a kind of a human?
I'm leading myself, behind myself
Day by day
No one see, what I see
My face is a mirror
I'm sitting behind
Wearing what you'll see
Behind this grotesque mask of humanity.
Questions without answer
Answers with unreadable questions
The cosmic plan, before my eyes.
Emptiness,

,Мы за пределами правил. К чёрту, всё так как должно быть.
,Главное, что мы есть друг у друга.

,Ты со мной словно на фронте - верный солдат и товарищ.
,Ты полюбила мой голос, что утром прошепчет "Родная".
,Ты засыпаешь так скромно, а я всё ещё не понимаю (да) -

,Твой силуэт нарисует мне полночь.

,И где-то вдалеке далёко ждёт его она:
,Чистая, не раз не тронута руками грязными -

,Никому тебя не отдам! Ни за что! Никогда! Никому!
,Нам не прожить и минуты в разлуке,
,Словно цепи стальные связали нам руки.
,И не смогут спасти: ни друзья, ни подруги -
,Мы, вдвоём остаёмся словно в замкнутом круге.
,Все дороги ведут в тупик, перехожу на крик -
,Снова неравный бой!
,Я никому тебя не отдам. Никогда не предам,
,Я буду всегда с тобой!
,Никому тебя не отдам, пока я еще дышу.
,Никому тебя не отдам! Ни за что! Никогда! Никому!
,
,Мне эту связь не объяснить ни физикой, ни Богом,
,Я знаю - через тыщу миль тревожно у порога
,Она присядет, сердце дрогнуло, как будто вестник.
,Душа болит, мам, это сын напишет тебе песни.
,Мамочка, мамуля, твоя радость, твои слёзы,
,Хоть в рифму, хоть в прозу, хоть под солнце, хоть в мороз и грёзы
,Я спешу с охапкой роз через все причины.
,Лишь твои морщины знают, как парнишка стал мужчиной.
,Я редко приезжаю мам, и звоню не часто.
,У меня нормально всё, расскажи, как у вас там?
,Как там бабушка? Чё нового взошло на грядке?
,Да, я суп покушал, да, зимой всегда гоняю в шапке.
,Видели по телеку, слишком груб и резкий,
,Я не умею правду прятать, мам, за занавеской.
,Ты не красней за то, что вырастила настоящего,
,Я обещаю мам приезжать по чаще.
,Сядем мам, тихо посидим,
,Время спрячет твои годы в красоту седин.
,Ты прости за то, что вырос, повзрослел рано.
,Повзрослел рано, мама...
,Сядем мам, тихо посидим.
,Ты, наверное, там слушаешь мои CD.
,Я надеюсь, не краснеешь за меня, мама.
,Не красней за меня, мам.
,Сядем мам, тихо посидим,
,Время спрячет твои годы в красоту седин.
,Ты прости за то, что вырос, повзрослел рано.
,Я рано вырос мама, рано раны вынес,
,Мама, рано протоптал туманы, рано добрели
,Ноги к порогам храма.
,Нет, я не лама, не учитель жизни, я не гуру.
,Не бухаю, не курю но, не держу фигуру.
,Жили обычно, мама - радуга-пружинка,
,Кожанка из Москвы и я с тобой малой на снимке.
,Смотрели фильмы "Один дома", где эти кассеты...
,На праздник собирались все друзья и все соседи.
,Тогда весь мир казался добрым, красочным и ярким.
,Новый год, ёлка, мандарины и подарки.
,Откуда, мам, берутся деньги, я не знал, простите,
,Когда говорил, что хочу как у всех CD-носитель.
,И пускай песен про мам, уже сотни было,
,Я буду любить тебя от колыбели до могилы.
,Я встречу в своей жизни тыщу близких, самых-самых,
,Но ни один из них мне не заменит слово "Мама".
,Сядем мам, тихо посидим,
,Время спрячет твои годы в красоту седин.
,Ты прости за то, что вырос, повзрослел рано.
,Повзрослел рано, мама...
,Сядем мам, тихо посидим.
,Ты, наверное, там слушаешь мои CD.

,Но завела меня дорога в топе.
,Я строго за правду, но кому это надо.
,Если продали вы души свои!
,Затоптанный мир и жирный КОП у руля.
,Как бы тебя не за, что не замели.
,Нам побоку эти двиги роботов.
,В нашем море не тонули корабли.
,Дизлайк всем не мирным, дизлайк всем продажным.
,Дизлайк тем, кто за спинами городит, сносит башню.
,У костра соберу самых близких друзей.
,Я мелодия добра на строй ровный \" Навее-е-е-й \"
,Конное время растянулось на вечность.
,Но в этой игре (ома-плей-я)
,Ома-плей-я...
,Броники на торсман, проваливай в космос.
,Выложи когда-то в этом мире все просто.
,И добрым взглядом, сверлит чел небо.
,Вот же на порядок выше и сверли своим Кредом.
,Головы на перекос, не нарикай на ловандос.
,Для паразита дихлофос, корыто разбито при накросах.
,Путай иной бабос, цени себя, а не закос
,И на вопрос любой ответом будет никогда не поздно.
,Напалмана - валом и напора не мало.

,Ворошилов мать его хватит шмалять и мне не все равно.
,Куда приведет этот образ жизни поломанный компас.
,Девочки топлесс, грёбаный комплекс души не потушить это пламя сжигает.
,Мой народ, но надо жить этажи забиты забитыми бонгами дабы забыть эту жизнь.
,Это жир, типа лавилиру дику трави себя по типу тех, кто слаб.
,Не находили выход а басота Лихо просирает дни.
,Хотя кому какая разница на правильном пути ты или в заднице.
,Поднимаю слово за тех, кто до талого верит это наш Владик, это наш Терек.

,Я нарулю жетоны и залипну в музыку, пока в дороге.
,Возможно набросаю строки, хотя нет постой-ка.
,Забыл блокнот и ручку, мегаполис прущий.
,Музыкант и тучи, ветер колючий, который тушит.
,Тепло души да, загоняет самого себя.
,Галимая возможность, что-то потерять.
,Что-то приобрести, либо же почитать.
,Я предпочитаю бит и мысли при параде.
,Канонады в небе, когда муза мутит заеб*сь.
,Когда кипит жизнь, или же когда залипли на закат глаза.
,Мой Майк ответит за базар и я готов вывернуть душу наружу, показать.
,Строки до запятой, строки не до конца.
,Каждая буква на треке, это мой ренессанс.
,Пали в глаза, если не верится, что мне нормально.
,Мияги постарается, остаться актуальным.
,Ноги сотру до колена улицы, но всё же пусть ведут меня.
,Туда где не нарулится, ведь это ерунда.
,Я зарублю на носу уроки те, что жизнь преподнесла.
,Скажи мне "не выйдет, не получится!", чтобы я тебя послал.
,Половина меня торчит на нотах остальная, половина пишет.
,Вали с советом к чёрту, тут не сыскать вам крыши.
,Музыкант готов быть нищим, богат четверостишьем.
,Свобода слова, сила любого и меня не вытащить уже.
,Трясина поглотила не по-детски.
,Громом на небе греметь будут, дабы качали песни.
,Дабы рубили треки в Мире заблудшего гада.
,Снова бессонная ночь, снова бессонная правда.
,Я с Нескафе на пару, залип на век на кухне.
,Тот человек, что без любви когда-нибудь рухнет.
,Надоедает картина, Кепа не палит оттенок.
,По магистралям и тропам, окопы людитина.
,Проблемы мира сего, опухоль возможного счастья.
,Красота помогай же, упаси от напастей.
,И как бы время не хотело сделать меня агрессивным.
,Раз пришел в этот мир, так и живи с миром.
,Ноги сотру до колена улицы, но всё же пусть ведут меня.
,Туда где не нарулится, ведь это ерунда.
,Я зарублю на носу уроки те, что жизнь преподнесла.
,Скажи мне "не выйдет, не получится!", чтобы я тебя послал.

,Вавилон
,At the starting of the week.
,At summit talks you'll hear them speak.
,It's only Monday.
,Negotiations breaking down.
,See those leaders start to frown.
,It's sword and gun day.
,Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
,Пропал сон, мысли вон,
,Для меня житуха - Вавилон.
,Музыке поклон, рифмами, патронами,
,Я буду заряжать извилины.
,Если ты не веришь, как и я, от меня беги,
,Я боли не гадал, как и где мне себя найти.
,Просто надо было подниматься и идти,
,Я видел звезды днем, они велели плыть.
,И как бы не хотело время - Вечного вам не убить!
,Улицы дарили грязь, кишили злом.
,Мы будем убивать страх, будем двигать на пролом,
,Как по мне, так мира сего нет -
,И мы не в праве заблуждаться и придумывать ответ.
,Как бы ты не хотел имея волю говорить,
,Услышит тот тебя, что хочет слышать хочет победить.
,Это же вечная война человека и бабла,
,Меняем золото на то, что не купить нам никогда.
,At the starting of the week.
,At summit talks you'll hear them speak.
,It's only Monday.
,Negotiations breaking down.
,See those leaders start to frown.
,It's sword and gun day.
,Tomorrow never comes until it's too late
,А мы гуляли по полям, погладит ветер эту суть,
,Разнесёт по городам. Добра не жди, когда-нибудь увижу.
,Светлый горизонт подарит мне всё то, о чем мечтали вы давно -
,И миру мира не видать, но...
,Мы так-то призваны спасать больные души и мораль,
,Вот бы нам взять и полетать над этим миром высоко.
,Наследие веков, не расплескать бы до конца,
,Освободится от оков, но.
,Не так-то просто поменять мутное видение людей,
,Но надо пробовать опять, опять, опять, опять, опять.
,Пароли, провода меня несли по городам,
,Я с этой музой навсегда, но.
,Улицы демоны, в погоне за временем
,И верили или не верили, на воле или за стенами,
,Те головы, что запрели не разбудят в себе первого.
,At the starting of the week.
,At summit talks you'll hear them speak.
,It's only Monday.
,Negotiations breaking down.
,See those leaders start to frown.
,It's sword and gun day.
,Tomorrow never comes until it's too late.

,
,Помни я твой, ты в моем сердце,
,в этих минутах и в этих часах
,Помни, для меня ты вне конкуренции,
,солнце, ты греешь меня в лучах
,Мне с тобой так легко, так тепло,
,и для нас целая Вселенная
,Загляну в глаза твои глубоко,
,там красота необыкновенная
,Чувствую силу,
,около тебя мой мир, мой стимул
,Так каждый день и чтобы там не было
,Где бы меня не носило,
,я обратно лечу к тебе
,И снова эти объятия на двоих,
,для меня они бывают дороже их
,И снова утону в глазах твоих,
,ведь я без ума от них
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Поделим на двоих все наши дни и ночи
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Мне никуда без них
,Без них я обесточен
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Поделим на двоих все наши дни и ночи
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Мне никуда без них
,Без них я обесточен
,Я для тебя все-все на свете и мне не нужен никто другой
,С тобой на душе постоянное лето,
,и я в это вложил любовь
,Чтобы ни говорили, ни выдумывали,
,никому наше счастье не обнулить
,И даже когда я у тебя вдали,
,в самолете отрываюсь от земли
,Как будто отрываю тебя от сердца,
,как будто теряю тебя и свой пульс
,Теряю чувства, мне некуда деться,
,но знаю точно, что вернусь
,И снова эти объятия на двоих,
,для меня они бывают дороже их
,И снова утону в глазах твоих,
,ведь я без ума от них
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Поделим на двоих все наши дни и ночи
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Мне никуда без них
,Без них я обесточен
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Поделим на двоих все наши дни и ночи
,Я утону в глазах твоих
,Мне никуда без них
,Без них я обесточен

Do you think you're made of gold? 
Invincible? 
You think you can handle it? 
You will learn from this. 
I'm telling you friend 
this is something worth fighting for. 
Does it not seem contradicting 
to sit back and watch them take more? 
Caught like a deer in their headlights, you're stuck now. 
You're bound by your fears 
I suggest you break free or 
you'll forever be damned here. 
We are merely degenerates waiting for you. 
They keep marching on 
spilling blood like savages. 
Taking lives while your cigarette burns, burns. 
You can't tell me my friend 
that that wasn't worth dying for. 
gave it all and received nothing 
may as well have let them take more. 
Dig deep find the courage to speak 
are you really still bound by your fear? 
This is all just a dream now 
you can't speak and you're damned here. 
We are merely degenerates waiting for you. 
They keep marching on 
spilling blood like savages. 
Taking lives while your cigarette burns, burns. 
This is our fight for freedom 
this is our way of saying 
this is our day. 
We've been waiting for this one day all our lives 
This nothing short of predictable. 
Stop holding your head down 
Give it up! 
get a hold of yourself now. 
Or give it up! 
Your like a deer in the headlights, 
You've given up! 
To save your life. 
We've been waiting, yeah waiting all our lives 
This nothing short of predictable. 
Stop holding your head down 
Give it up! 
get a hold of yourself now. 
Or give it up! 
Your like a deer in the headlights, 
You've given up! 
To save your life. 
Find the will to save your life! 

Just trying to find your way anywhere
But you've come to find you're alone
Its getting dark and you've lost your way
I haven't let you go as long as you know that..
I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But ill fight till the end for her heart
Ill never give up for what's possibly
For better for worse this love must be cursed
Just try to keep your head down
But you come to find that trust has come and gone
Everyone out there is listening
But you don't care at all and you're probably glad to know
I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But ill fight till the end for her heart
Ill never give up for what's possibly
For better for worse this love must be cursed
You already let it pass through your lips you can't take it back now ,
I'm losing what's left of my dignity
But ill fight till the end for her heart
Ill never give up for what's possibly
For better for worse this love must be cursed
Holding on to her
This love must be cursed
I'm holding on to her
This love must be cursed
I'm holding on
I'm afraid to say she never made it home
Couldn't keep her head on
She was so close
I'm afraid to say she never made it home , 

And don't tell me, i'm afraid of waking up alone
But it's waking up to find you've gone
But you make it clear,
I had my chances
Only one way left to go,
So i'll follow it down
She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now
So shes traded my love for comfort,
Gives it all away
So much for that happy ending
Now you make it clear,
You've got your options
Only one way left to go,
So i'll follow it down
She can't hold her own!
Who would have known!
She is misery's company!
She's got no place to go!
No place to call home!
She's got misery's company!
She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now,
Be careful!
Be careful now
She only come to me in my dreams,
So sleep becomes routine,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you
She only come to me in my dreams,
So sleep becomes addicting,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you
Hold her strings to haunt my dreams,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you
She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now,
Be careful! 

Would you agree that we're far from all right? 
(We fall below the line! We fall below the standards!) 
If only you could see 
What we see through these eyes 
(This plague is spreading, it will sink under your skin!) 
I won't believe the horror that I see 
Is more than your poison inside me 
Let's tear away these faces we hide behind 
Cutting through the airwaves 
Open up our minds 
Show ourselves to the world tonight 
Cause we are.. No longer in disguise! 
Well, I'm aware of your lies, how do you sleep at night? 
(It's all a matter of time, I think their catching on) 
You dream of wars, that I refuse to fight 
(While people disappear, another broken heart) 
I won't believe the horror that I see 
Is more than your poison inside me 
I won't let go, though the plague is spreading 
I won't let go 
Let's tear away these faces we hide behind 
Cutting through the airwaves 
Open up our minds 
Show ourselves to the world tonight 
Cause we are… No longer in disguise! 
We can save ourselves 
(Rise Up!) 
You can't stop us 
We can save our soul 
(Rise Up!) 
We don't need your help 
We can save ourselves 
(Rise Up!) 
You can't stop us 
Let's tear away these faces we hide behind 
Cutting through the airwaves 
Open up our minds 
Show ourselves to the world tonight 
Cause we are… No longer in disguise! 
Tear away these faces 
Tear away these faces 
Tear away these faces 
We're no longer in disguise! 

If I flew into a mountain
Burn myself to nothing
That would be something 
Would it be enough?
A pistol to my temple
Pull the trigger like its nothing
That would be something, but it's never enough
This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?
It makes no difference what I do for you 
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough 
I hurt someone that loved you
Except that I felt nothing
That would be something, would it be enough?
I had everything you wanted
It shows to give you nothing
That would be something 
This is all too much
This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?
It makes no difference what I do for you 
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
I'm burning alive
With a pistol to my temple
If we don't believe this reason for living
Then we'll never know do I want to know?
If we don't believe this reason for living
Then we'll never know do I want to know?
If we just give up give into the pressure we're losing it all
We're losing control
It makes no difference what I do for you 
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just won't ever be enough
(What I would do for you) 

Star crossed lovers
They say we're not meant to be
'Cause the stars in the sky, and the fashion that they are aligned.
I say if the futures been drawn out there's no point in living.
I wont give up my love so that fate can have its way.
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to.
Some learn the hard way,
We all learn through consequence.
I say if the futures been drawn out then nobody's living.
I won't give you up love, so fate can have its way.
Its way.
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
Is it over? (over)
(The stars keep this fire from burning out)
Is it over? (over)
(Are you saying that you'd really listen?)
Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)
Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
If the stars say that you can not love.
(The stars keep this fire from burning out)
If the stars say that you can not love me. 

Derailed
We failed to keep our love on course
Now we lost what was left
Of any chance that we had
What a way to go out
Derailed
I'm afraid I failed to keep you by my side
The mistakes we made
Will keep us drifting farther apart
What a way to go out 

Through a stranger's eyes
I take a good look at my life
Only to find that I'm not living
I'm not alive
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself
We all know life could end in an instant
We all just disappear
So let me put this into perspective
Let me make this clear
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself
I've grown tired of the same old fucking story
I think I'm ready for a change
If there's a higher power up there watching over me
Could you give me a sign today, today?
Cause I've grown tired, I've grown tired
I think I'm ready for a change
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I wanna find myself, I wanna find myself
I wanna wake up (I wanna find myself)
I just wanna wake up (I wanna find myself) 

We are out of our minds 
We cant live this way forever, forever 
So run, run with me from the ordinary 
Its our time to escape lose ourselves 
If we can find a way to break this chain 
Within this natural cycle 
Leave your answers behind we'll be there to decide 
If we can find the strength to go our own way, go our own way 
It will take your breath away; will take your breath away 
We are out of our minds 
We cant live this way forever, forever 
We finally found a way to make the change we'll make the change together 
We finally found the strength to go our own way to go our own way 
Now we are free again, we are free again, we are free again 
Do I have your attention? 
Look what we can create 
It will take your breath away; will take your breath away, away 
Do I have your attention? 
Now's our time to escape 
Found strength to go our own way 
Now we are free again, we are free again, again 
Now we are free again, we are free again; again, again, we are free again 

All systems go
This one, she's outta control
She lost her grip
I think she fell off the edge
She sinks her teeth in
There's no letting go
We've all come to find she's just a snake
A snake devil
This is not a full discussion
Now you are a thing of the past
And I won't live to see the sunrise
She says, "I want you to know, before you let me go
It's your fault I'm demoralized."
And I won't let what she says go to my head
No, not again
Taking over the world, one heart at a time
She'll chew you up and spit you out like nothing
Well, it's not her problem
Well, now we know
She's nothing more than just a snake
A snake devil
And I won't live to see the sunrise
its just a matter of time
Only a matter of time
And I won't live to see the sunrise
She says, "I want you to know, before you let me go
It's your fault I'm demoralized."
And I won't let what she says go to my head
No, not again
And I won't live to see the sunrise
No, I'd rather just die than listen to your lies
(No, I won't live to see the sunrise)
You've already done the damage
You are a thing of the past
She's a snake devil (x4)

Now you're scared of what you've see and only seen it in your dreams before 
Cause when you least expect it, it will take you, take you by surprise
So take advantage, take it all, take it all before the moment dies
It's already known 
It's written all over you
Don't let it go, 
keep it inside of you
Now that you've got it and it's slipping through your finger tips
Well you gave and let go, now it's missing from your life again
So now you're tearing up the walls making a mess trying to dig it up
Now it's all too late you'll never find it, and the moments dead
The moments dead
It goes without saying,
It's already gone 
It's written all over you
It goes without saying,
You let it go, 
There's nothing inside of you
It goes without saying..
You know you want it what are you waiting for?
Take it all when the moment dies
It goes without saying, 
It goes without saying
It's written all over you
It goes without saying
It goes without saying
Just keep it inside of you
It goes without saying, 
It goes without saying
It's written all over you
It goes without saying, 
It goes without saying
There's nothing inside of you
It goes without saying.. 

He sees what's beneath her skin he sees through her soul.
Blue eyes and empty veins her fortune unfolds.
She steps out of her body that lies on the floor.
Rise, rise from the ashes. 
Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure.
Blood runs forever, blood runs forever.
Full moon illuminates the streets breathing fire 
the dead come together to drink their desires. 
They march down the allies. The devils parade.
More of the turbulence that causes disaster.
More of the chaos erasing the borders.
More than Confusion and all that she fears.
The dark side is coming, the dark side is...
Rise, rise from the ashes. 
Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. 
Blood runs forever, blood runs forever,
Blood runs forever...
She's giving it all away (she's all the way there)
She's giving it all (she is prepared)
to take her place, to follow it along
she steps into the dark tonight
Rise, rise from the ashes. 
Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. 
Blood runs forever, blood runs forever.
Rise, rise from the ashes. 
Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. 
Blood runs forever, blood runs forever.
Blood runs forever
Blood runs forever
Blood runs forever... 

  I've grown tired of the same old story.
 I think I'm ready for a change. 
 If there's a higher power up there watching over me, 
 could you give me a sign today? 
 'Cause I've grown tired. I've grown tired.
 Now I'm ready for a change, a change...

The sounds of sirens are flooding the streets tonight
Yet we are all still willing to commit the crimes
Should we expect no consequence (No consequence)
Maybe our lies will pass the test (Will pass the test)
Eyes closed hands tied (Behind our backs we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets and liesBut we both know we are suspects to the crimeAnd running won't solve our problems this time)
Your hands are shaking as they're holding onto mine
A sense of hesitation is hidden in your eyes
I've seen a sketch in black and white (In black and white)
I've seen the face you try to hide (try to hideBehind the doors under the sheetsBut you are guilty just like meAnd none of us are innocentA cycle of Russian roulette)
Eyes closed hands tied (Behind our backs we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets and liesBut we both know we are suspects to the crimeAnd running won't solve our problems this time)(Pull up a seat next to me and lets face the juryOur only chance to come clean so what's it going to be?)

,end
Will we disappear if we stop moving?
Are we haunted by who we'll never be?
Are we losing heart and running out of time?
With songs of heroes and betrayers,
We must keep breathing, you must stay moving.
We are not an army of wolves led by a sheep.
I won't let you down, nothing will break us,
With songs of heroes and traitors, nothing will break us.
I say we pull ourselves together,
I say we fight with all our hearts,
I say we wage this war forever or...

,Until we fall apart,
,Wake up and move like it's the last time.
,Until we fall apart,
,It's not the end, it's never the end.
,While we still have heart,
,Your demise designed in time.
,While we still have heart,
,A bond tied to blood
,You have nowhere to run, nowhere to run.
,And I will admit that I am afraid of the life
,That I could be living instead of mine.
,Paint me a nightmare into my eyes,
,And sew me up, leave all the tools inside.
,(Just sew me up, leave all the tools inside.
,Just sew me up, leave all the tools inside.)
,I've been awake, but always afraid
,To fall asleep, for fear I'll see your face.
,(To fall asleep, for fear I'll see your face.)
,Just tell me it's not too late.
,Stay away, for I am fragile.
,I'm not asleep as death is tied to rest.
,This is more than you can handle.
,You've never been so consumed.
,Why do we hate the things that we can't change?
,Why do we hurt the ones we can't control?
,Why do we hold on to our yesterdays like we can't let go?
,Why do we fear nothing?
,Why do we want everything?
,This is all too much
,Held back no longer to wait,
,We will take what's ours
,And courage will lift us.
,I'll see you when I wake up,
,Mark my words, this won't be the end.
,Leaving's the hardest part.
,Mark my words.I will return.
,Why do we hate the things that we can't change?
,Why do we hurt the ones we can't control?
,Why do we hold on to our yesterdays like we can't let go?
,Why do we fear nothing?
,Why do we want everything?
,Said it's just a nightmare,
,Go back to sleep.
,Said it's just a nightmare,
,And I run, and I run from the only one
,Who can wake me up.
,
,Pushed away
,This is my dream, I'll die to defend it
,A jury of wolves, chained to a city
,All of my heroes are thieves
,This is a warning
,Time will haunt you
,I will cut you down
,I pray you fear that end is near
,Breathe in the air, now that we're older, isn't it colder than before?
,And I had a heart of gold but it doesn't seem to shine bright anymore
,So let's open a jar of fireflies
,And light up your room tonight, and lose track of our lives
,doesn't it feel just like the first time?
,Breathe in the air, isn't it colder than you remember?
,And this summer breeze could make me believe
,it's the dead of December
,Always wanting to feel alive and always ending up unsatisfied
,'Cause no matter how I try, it'll never feel just like the first time
,I claim this hate
,All the scars on your sleeve are the price that you pay
,Idols turn to dust
,All your beliefs covered in rust
,Bring down the throne
,Tear down the altar
,Burn it in your mind
,I will protect this with my life
,Burn it in your mind
,I will protect this with my life
,Can you hear me?
,This is a song of a traitor
,In a world of open wounds
,Are you listening?
,This is a song of a traitor
,In a world of open wounds
,So after all we've learned and after all we've seen and after everything
,Will you help me tear it down?
,Will you help me tear it down?
,And after all the lies that kept us occupied while they slipped the knife
,Won't you help me tear it down?
, Won't you help me tear it down?
,No heroes, just traitors
,Who will you believe?
,(Won't you help me tear it down?)
,Bring down the throne
,Tear down the altar
,And after all the years they tricked us into stacking bricks
,Won't you help me tear it down
,So we can rebuild it?
,Pushed away
,This is my dream, I'll die to defend it
,A jury of wolves, chained to a city
,All of my heroes are thieves
I believe we'll let it all fall apart. 
What have I done? "What have I done?" 
To know how the end will come. 
I won't let go, "I won't let go," 
To the trust built in our convictions. 
It came and went so fast, Done and done. 
We don't know how to love. 
What am I looking for? 
I am so lost 
We are so lost. 
Have we become so numb we can't feel our own hearts beat? 
I don't trust in us, we don't know how to love. 
I believe we'll let it all fall apart. 
I was king, but only for a moment. 
I watched my dreams collapse. 
We came here to love. 
We came here to grow. 
Never to fall. 
When you have only let me down. 
I shouldn't have let you in. 
I'm always searching for the answer. 
All these questions don't have answers, 
no road seems to lead home. 
Are we lost at sea? 
Now it seems it's every man for himself, 
I never knew how ugly this world could be. 
I want to watch you burn alive. 
Where is your dignity? 
You'll never have me. 
It's true we were meant to die. 
Is this what you wanted to here. 
You gave up the only thing you had left. 
And when you go, don't forget to close the door behind you. 
And when you go, don't' forget the walls of fire we walked through. 
The words you said cut to a part of me that I never even knew was there. 
The words you said captured, so beautifully, this nightmare. 
So tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'll never find someone who can please me. 
And tell me I'm not the person you had in mind when you gave me your heart, 
Oh tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'll never find what I am looking for. 
And tell me again until my ears bleed, before I shut the door. 
I'm not coming back.
  And I've been losing my mind since I was born into this dark world
 and I don't believe in anything 'cause I can't forget the things I've seen.
 But the only thing left worth fighting for is the innocence in you
 and I'd rather die before I see it disappear.
 
 When winds carry us by compass rose
 Not even her arms feel like home
 Nailed to a broken dream
 There's no place for me
 
 So if you're gonna' stay, then how long would you wait for me before your love begins to fade?
 I just can't spend all of my days in this place wasting away.
 So don't forget me when I'm gone, I promise I won't be long.
 Maybe carrying all these burdens will teach us to be strong.
 
 None shall pass
 I will pay for this
 Nailed to a broken dream
 There's no place for me
 
 No security
 Crown or comfort
 Shackled to a bed of thorns
 The water's at your throat
 To get burned when you've been warned
 
 And the last of my sanity is slipping slowly from me,
 I just can't sit still - I just can't fucking breathe.
 And I'm chasing something but I don't know what it is,
 but it just won't let go.
 
 So if I lose control, then how long would you wait for me to find my way around these walls?
 My mind's a maze I'm stranded in, and my bones might rot where I fall.
 Is this air laced with Novocaine, 'cause I don't feel anything at all.
 If I can't have you and I can't find truth, then what's the point of waking up?
 
 And if I could have another chance, I wouldn't change a single thing.
 I'd run like hell and not look back as the world burns down behind me.
 And I would swear to change it all, I wouldn't let them push me to my knees.
 I would fight like an animal. I wouldn't do a thing differently.
 
 Carry me away from here and teach me to be strong
 This is my own escape
 It's not where we were promised to be
 I'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness
 
 There's no place for me
 Pull me away from,
 Pull me away from here
 
 So if you're gonna' stay, then how long would you wait for me before your love begins to fade?
 I wish that part of me believed that I'm gonna' come home someday.
 Is there purpose without meaning?
 Is there a life that's worth living?
 Is there a chance to change things or have we really ruined everything?

The ride rose so fast you didn't have time to think
Wave crashing storms above collide
The problem is, hope won't clear this devistation
Shadows below circle, you struggle
Your lungs fill with guilt
Now you've had some time to think
While you're sinking
The oceans strength will drag you beneath
The fact now so clear, the truth is hard to hear
Even in water your sweat protrudes
How does it feel
To tread so far
Lost sight of the shore
Lost sight of everything
How did you let this ocean defeat you?
How did it come to this?
You're always giving up
You've got nothing to show for this
Always swimming for your life
You're lost in the ocean depths
But never finding the shore
The ride rose so fast I didn't have time to think
Wave crashing storms above collide
In every sea treachery
There's a killer beneath
In every sea treachery
Is closer than you think
Your life is a shipwreck
You're lost in the depths
And theres a killer beneath you 

作曲 : Sworn Enemy
You think you're bulletproof, deception is your guise 
False prophet sent to lead the working class demise 
We the people stand to lose our blue skies turn grey 
Figurehead of a fallen nation time of eternal dismay 
We face our toughest battles with a foreign foe 
Cells unlike any other you'd ever know 
Invaded lands now they won't go 
For years and years our soil unknown 
Hide your children behind their closed doors 
Now watch your 1st borns go fight the war... 
Poverty is not a crime 
The poor the weak all suffer in time 
The first to go stand the frontline 
Constantly walking a fine line 
Absorb the lies we face deceit a countries politics based on greed 
A better place so we've been told 300 years to soon to be bold 
The thought of this makes me sick to see a country so great 
Living in the dark ages the truth will makes us hate 
Invaded lands now they won't go 
For years and years our soil unknown 
Hide your children behind their closed doors 
Now watch your 1st borns go fight the war... 
United they won't break us 
United won't be broken 
United won't break us 
United won't be broken 
You want war... 
We'll bring you war!!!!!
What you trying to say to me my time is ticking 
Seconds are fading away my hands are tied well 
I don't have nothing to say 
I'm itching inside 
I feel myself hitching a ride another dose 
Just to keep my body alive 
I won't apologize 
I have nothing to say 
There's no compromise 
My life just keeps slipping away 
If I fall 
I wont be getting up this time 
No standing tall think 
I reached the end of the line 
The path I choose leading me to my demise 
I'm falling fast cant keep living life like the past 
I won't apologize 
I have nothing to say 
There's no compromise 
My life just keeps slipping away 
In this life there are no second chances 
No second chances 
No second chances 
My cards were dealt this hand must be played 
My clock is ticking no time for delay 
Life is a gamble 
I still played the game 
No second chances are rolling my way 
No second chances 
No second chances 
No second chances
I fight for what is mine no control is what 
I fear My beliefs 
I will not change this voice you will hear 
This is my life wont change for anyone 
No need for explanations your questions ignored 
Talk all you want till your blue in the face 
Your useless words mean nothing here 
You think you got something to say 
Well ignorance is bliss 
Save your breathe you've crossed that line 
Save your breathe you cant take what's mine 
Destroy the ignorance mind 
Trust you seek something you'll never find 
Destroy the ignorance mind 
Trust you seek something you'll never find 
You'll never find 
This is my life wont change for anyone 
No need for explanations your questions ignored 
Talk all you want till your blue in the face 
Your useless words mean nothing here 
You think you got something to say 
Well ignorance is bliss 
Picture this me being like you imagine that for just a second fool 
No right to judge me or say what you feel so save your breathe 
Save your breathe you've crossed that line 
Save your breathe you can take what's mine 
I never needed anyone 
I'll always stand on my own 
I never needed anyone 
I'll always stand on my own
作曲 : Sworn Enemy
Man made we die 
Can’t escape these thoughts in my mind 
Could it be my time here 
Gone like mist in the open air 
What we create will infect 
Everything we touch until the end 
Scared of the unknown 
Prepare to be alone 
Minutes feel like hours 
Days seem like years 
Final ticking of the clock 
Releases all your fears 
Somewhere in time 
Face the future we leave behind 
Scared of the unknown 
Prepare to be alone 
Man made we die 
Can’t escape these thoughts in my mind 
Could it be my time here 
Gone like mist in the open air 
Scared of the unknown 
Prepare to be alone... 
Turn to the light when darkness falls 
Shutter from the sight annihilation of us all 
In the blink of an eye 
The decimation of all of mankind 
Wipe away all the sins of the earth 
Cleanse the ground a new rebirth...
Forgive them... of all their sins 
Soft spoken with no lies 
A man for the people 
Not one to beg not one to shout 
Teacher to all for what this life’s about 
Nothing to gain, what’s so insane 
He’s known better to all just for his pain 
Mother dearest waiting to send 
Her son to the beginning of the end 
This is the beginning of the end 
This is the beginning of the end 
Fate of millions rests in my hands 
Now this do 
I understand 
Rivers of red running through my head 
I walk this path alone made up of the dead 
The strength of the few runs through my veins 
Forgive the killers the bringers of pain 
On that morning something’s dawning 
Ray of light broke through the sky 
Save a prayer for our brothers 
Consequence of one tiny lie 
Father tells me of my journey 
To a place 
I wish to be 
But I must forsake my life 
And travel down this path of agony 
This is the beginning of the end 
This is the beginning of .... the ... end 
This is the end
We're still breathing
Some days I wake up and hope
The world is a better place
Same old story yet a different day again and again
I'll tear out your eyes and take them away with me
Just so that you can see the world
The world that I've got to see
Now sink with me
When you look around trying to realise how
How you got to this miserable place
All your friends are gone family dead
Life passed you by
Feeling alone inside
Everything is dead
Everything you ever loved has slipped away
Some things can never last forever
This is where it ends
Everything is dead
Everything is fucking dead
Everything is dead
I'll make sure they leave your heart til last
Now sink with me
We're still breathing
I wrote the book on how to ruin everything
I tore your flesh away from bone 

Fucking bow down 
You were the price of the killing while we were waiting on the other side 
The other ones were just standing out but we were playing on the other side 
You can close your eyes 
Forget what you have seen 
Bless us all 
They are guilty 
Bring back what is yours 
We tried to escape but you still waste 
Waste away 
Nothing remains 
Nothing is safe 
No mistakes 
You can't take away what you've given away 
You were the price of the killing 
We were just playing

,THIS WILL BE THE END OF YOU!
,(Ladies and gentlemen, friends and foe's,
,this song goes out to all you fucking quitters out there)
,How dare you stare at the ground when you
,don't even know which direction to go?
,Are you really that anxious to drift life away,
,and just give up on yourself?
,You better dance to the beat of living.
,Start taking control and take care of yourself.
,Reach out for help if you're falling,
,We're in this together.
,You're in this alone.
,Don't be proud enough to reach out for help.
,She's on fire but her embers burn her bridges.
,And she knows that she can't walk on water.
,Yet she tries.
,For what is worse than to ask your friends for help.
,And so she sinks to the bottom of the sea.
,Burn out the eyes of the traitors face.
,They have told their final line.
,They have told their final line.
,One more time we'll throw down our fucking fists.
,To anyone who stand against us.
,To anyone who disagree.
,Stop chasing your shadow. You're in this alone.
,You need to fight until your heart stops beating.
,Don't think for a second that you will be saved.
,Hands down. It's over.
,This is the end of everything.
,And sure as hell i'm taking you with it.
,I rather die with blood on my hands,
,if my conscious is clean and my heart's been beating pure.
,For what is living if you've already dead?
,She's on fire but her embers burn her bridges.
,And she knows that she can't walk on water.
,She's on fire but her embers burn her bridges.

,We're swimming and sinking,
,We're running and falling,
,We're breathing, not living,
,We're crashing down!
,We hold the answers in our hearts
,as we been singing times before.
,We spend every breath to stand our ground
,but what's the point when we're sinking?

,In ancient days of Khem
,A Pharaon was praising
,The sun above Amon
,Osiris, Mother Isis and Thoth
,The gods would punish the hybris of Pharao
,He wrapped himself in false sunshine
,He was the founding father of the only God
,But he provoked a fit of rage
,Son of the Sun, it was his name
,Son of the Sun, the sun will burn your wings
,Son of the Sun, beware of Aton
,Son of the Sun, your God will let you down
,The Sphinx burst into tears
,And pyramids are shaking
,The precipice is close
,When Pharao is losing his faith
,Visions of madness led the Pharaon astray
,The portents were too ominous
,Until this day his curse is still the plague of man
,We must defeat the only God
,Son of the Sun, it was his name
,Son of the Sun, the sun will burn your wings
,Son of the Sun, beware of Aton
,Son of the Sun, your God will let you down
,Apep will come
,Son of the Sun, it was his name

,Nothing is real
,Can't you see
,I cannot feel
,Take me away
,Bury me in the sand
,Cause after all these years I am still the same
,A sad and bitter man
,Take me away
,Bury me in the sand
,Cause after all these years I am still the same
,A sad and bitter man
,Crush my hope, grow my hate
,There's no home for me
,Nothing to give, nothing to say
,So tell me it's a dream
Bland skuggor rider en odjur
 Som en svarta träd
 Griper hård på en mäktig hammar
 Ut för svaga kristna blod
 
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 
 Trollhammaren sveper igen!
 Hugga ned, broder igen!
 Hör det sista ropet
 Trollhammaren är här!
 
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 
 Han är inte en människa
 Inte bräcklig och svag som dig
 Du ska vara maktlös
 Inga ögon ser din änd
 
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 
 Sedan mörkret övertog
 Räds den frostens kalla fingrar
 Som griper tag och förlever
 Under kommande vinternatt
 
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 TROLLHAMMAREN!
 
 (English translation:)
 
 The Troll Hammer
 
 Amongst the shadows rides a beast
 Like a black tree
 Gripping hard a mighty hammer
 Looking for weak Christian blood
 
 The Troll Hammer!
 The Troll Hammer!
 
 The Troll Hammer, swoops again!
 Strike down, brother again!
 Hear the last howl
 The Troll Hammer is here!
 
 He is not human
 Not fragile and weak like you
 You will be helpless
 No eyes see your end
 
 The Troll Hammer!
 The Troll Hammer!
 
 Then the darkness took control
 Fearing the cold fingers of frost
 That take hold and persist
 During coming winter night
 The Troll Hammer!
 The Troll Hammer!
 The Troll Hammer!

,Beyond what's real
,An in safety hidden sphere
,Away from our daily reality
,Truth lies out there
,Truth lies out there

,I belong to a world of twilight and regret
,Sing my song to the ones who never hear it
,The spell is cast, time is frozen for eternity
,I know it lasts only till the sun is rising
,Sinful is my heart, my darling
,Let me share with you
,Come with me to a place far away
,Come enter the worlds in the shadows
,All my scars are painted with the blood that I once have
,My old heart had to see it all to win my freedom
,Sinful is my soul, my darling
,Let me share with you
,Come with me to a place far away
,Come enter the worlds in the shadows
,See through my eyes and feel what I feel
,Come take my hand and just dare to believe
,Come with me to a place far away
,Come enter my world

Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying me down
Oh, open your eyes
Its alright
Oh!
I'm hellbound in this life
Keep fighting this endless war
It's always been like this, I don't know why
As they've gone up your mind
Your fear, it ties you down
Going down
I won't bow
No!
Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me
I'm haunted for the vertical of silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight
I can't breathe
Oh
These days are only now
Breathing in the coldest lies
I think thats only what you have in mind
Holding onto the best of you
I hit the pavement
Going down
I won't bow
Don't!
Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me
I'm haunted for the vertical of silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight
I can't breathe
I've been patient 
But it's colors that I leave
Too many shades of grey
I cannot breathe
The dreams I have been tainted
I need you to believe
The only way to make them breathe
Oh!
(I can't breathe)
Screaming at the walls of fire
They're closing in on me
I'm haunted for the vertical of silver moonlight
It's where I wanna be
Screaming at the walls of fire
But I'm still running free
In the silver moonlight
I can't breathe
(I can't breathe)
Turn around, open your eyes
Can't move on, the fear is tying me down
Oh, open your eyes
Its alright

,I feel my heart explode to particles
,Love is always here and I told you so
,Restless in dreams love carved in stone
,Thie rhapsody of life in a way
,I guess we all know it
,Hand in hand we stand while we watch you flow
,Heaven can you help us, where we can't go
,Covered by roses
,When this dance is over
,We all know all beauty will die
,The choirs have awoken
,Left no words unspoken
,Remember you as long as I can
,Hold you in my arms all night
,And spill the wine until the end
,We all have our place in time
,Need to live every moment
,We built our castles high
,Turned our dreams to gold
,We took the blows with pride
,Went through it all
,The dawn is closing in
,New tales are told
,This rhapsody of life
,In a way, I guess we all know
,Covered by roses
,When this dance is over
,We all know all beauty will die
,The choirs have awoken
,Left no words unspoken
,Remember you as long as I can
,Hold you in my arms all night
,And spill the wine until the end
,We all have our place in time
,Need to live every moment
,For all we are falling stars in the night
,A blinding light raging down from the sky
,The rise and fall, the rhapsody of our lives
,It's all we are and know, we've got to let go
,Covered by roses
,When this dance is over
,We all know all beauty will die
,The choirs have awoken
,Left no words unspoken
,Remember you as long as I can
,Hold you in my arms all night
,And spill the wine until the end
,We all have our place in time
,Need to live every moment

The presence
The dweller I must strike down
From where I stand
My shadow
On the doorstep we shall meet again
The one who stands guard before the gate
Oh the horror, by dread I'm seized
The terror of my dreams released
I die and die yet again
On my way... towards my fate
The last of ends
The end of the tunnel 
I see
A faint glow far away
Calling me
I must squeeze myself through this narrowness
Towards the other side
Striving
Angst and a sudden empowerment
And I am through
Oh by horror I am unleashed
The terror of my dreams released
I die and die yet again
On my way towards my fate
The last of ends

作词 : Shagrath, Silenoz
Glinsende månelys ovenfor driver
Frostlagte stier viser vei
Svarte sjeler farer henover natten
Inn gjennom skodde heim
Alt har svartnet
Alt lys er svunnet hen
Lødig trer vi nå inn i Riket
I minne om at våre spor blir fulgt
Omgitt av sorgens dis
Skrider ferden frem
Som en skare av likkledde skrømt
Vandrer vi jervens hjem
Brisen fører oss over norske myrer
Forbi hver en tåkegrend
Med hatet i våre harme sinn
Reiser vi for aldri å komme igjen
Taking hits is something I'm used to
If you want to break my head
 one thing they should know
Only beer could save your soul

Punishment for those
If you want to break my head
In service of Death
Only beer could save your soul

But Satan laughs and doesn't help
If you want to break my head
You are gonna die in Hell tonight
Only beer could save your soul

Chasing down highways
If you want to break my head
You are gonna die in Hell tonight
No food, just guns

chores
It's death I'm bringing
When rules are gone
Descending out of heaven
I am a loaded gun
At the Gates
Slaughter Of The Soul
Blinded By Fear
We are blind to the
worlds within us,
waiting to be born
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears
Born of the demon sky
Twisting reality
Sweet nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
Nauseating pain
Is death the only release?
The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears
I cast aside my chains
Fall from reality
Suicidal diseases
The face of all your fears
Now covered with scars
Humanity exiled
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
Purgatory unleashed
Now burn the face of the earth
The face of all your fears
All of your dreams unleashed
The face of all your fears

Attack! Going in for the kill. Take none alive
Eradicate the weak. The strong survive
From out of the darkness comes the light
Through hollow eyes the truth is seen
Smash down the walls that stand between
The poison apple and the bite
They will do all that they must
To satisfy their bloodlust
Strike! Either kill or be killed
Torn piece by piece
No one can tame. The nature of the beast
Vicious territorial instinct fight
Premeditated murder scene
Savior never comes it's a faded dream
Teeth sink in deep upon first bite
Their greed is so disgusting
Supremacy is rusting
Pathetic lies beyond the obscene
Filthy wounds seldom licked clean
The bloody wounds not clotting
The carcass slowly rotting

Der Mönch spaziert die Kirche raus
lässt hinter sich das Gotteshaus
Die Zeit des betens ist vorbei
Zum ersten mal fühlt er sich frei
Den Kirchenfesseln abgeschworen ist er neugeboren
Tauscht nun seine Kutte ein für einen Krug voll Wein
Eine Dirne, viele Dirnen sind ihm nicht genug
Es fehlt ihm noch in seiner Hand ein aufgefüllter Krug
Sauf, Sauf. Sauf ihn aus und füll ihn wieder auf
Der Mönch steht nun besoffen da
Und amüsiert sich wunderbar
Sein Unterleib ist ganz entblößt
der kräftig in die Dirne stößt
Hoi! Hoi! Geht es Rund
der Sinn erfreut, der Stabe wund
Er denkt sich nur noch, das ist fein!
Das kann doch keine Sünde sein
Den Kirchenfesseln abgeschworen ist er neugeboren
Tauschte nun seine Kutte ein für einen Krug voll Wein
Eine Dirne - viele Dirnen sind ihm nicht genug
Es fehlt ihm nur in seiner Hand ein aufgefüllter Krug
Der Mönch aus der Taverne wankt
Sich selbst für die Entscheidung dankt
Dass er dem Kloster ist enflohen
Die Freiheit ist dafür sein Lohn
Den Kirchenfesseln abgeschworen ist er neugeboren
Tauscht nun seine Kutte ein für einen Krug voll Wein
Eine Dirne viele Dirnen sind ihm schon genug
Das wichtigste ist weg zu sein vom kirchlichen Betrug
Ich stehe auf dem Felde, die Waffen in der Hand 
Mit totem, starren Blicke und wehendem Gewand 
Dort drüben auf dem Hügel steht unser Feind 
Später sind wir auf dem Schlachtfeld kämpfend vereint 
Ein Hornstoß, das Signal zum Kampf 
Trägt der Wind ans Ohr 
Mit einem lauten Kampfesschrei stoße ich hervor 
Der Klang von Stahl, der Fleisch zerreisst 
Schreie voller Schmerz 
Schon hol ich mit dem Schwerte aus 
Durchstoss damit ein Feindesherz 
Hort ihr Götter mein Gebet, erachtet mein flehn 
Hier, nach dem Kampfe, meine Ahnen zu sehn 
Ich verspüre keine Angst, heute hier zu fallen 
Ich kehre nach dem Tode ein in Odins Hallen 
So schlage ich ein Feindeshaupt mit einem hieb vom Rumpf 
Da trifft mich eine Axtesklinge, hart und stumpf 
Ich spüre meine Knochen brechen, sinke zur Erde 
Nun bin ich mir ganz sicher, dass ich gleich sterben werde 
Da lieg ich nun in meinem Blute, bin vor Schmerz ganz starr 
Aus meinem Körper ragt ein Stumpf, wo einst mein Arme war 
Ein Soldat, er schlägt sein Schwert, fest auf mich herab 
Dieser fest geführte Hieb brachte mich ins Grab
..............................
Unter den Wipfeln in einem alten Wald
lebt seit langem eine seltsame Gestalt
vom Alter schwach und tief gebückt
doch von Lebenskraft beglückt
Herr des Waldes lass uns ein
Teil von deiner Schöpfung sein 
Gib uns was von Götterhand
unter deiner Macht entstand
düster und kalt
mächtig und alt
kraftvoll erwacht
durchdrungen von Macht
was der Mensch mit Füßen tritt
unter seiner Schändung litt
wo heute noch die Bäume stehen 
wird bald schon die Welt vergehen
nirgendwo wird Leben sprießen
Feuer wird statt Wasser fließen
düster und kalt
mächtig und alt
kraftvoll erwacht
durchdrungen von Macht
Blätterrauschen, Vogelsang
das aus deiner Macht entsprang
wo heute noch die Bäume stehen 
wird bald schon die Welt vergehen
nirgendwo wird Leben sprießen
Feuer wird statt Wasser fließen

,Mightiest am I
,but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine
,For the black hills consists of black souls
,souls that already dies one thousand deaths
,Behind the stone walls of centuries they breed their black art
,Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold
,Far up in the mountains
,where the rain fall not far
,yet the sun cannot reach
,The wizards, my servants, summon the souls of macrocosm
,No age will escape my wrath
,I travel through time and I return to the future
,I gather wisdom now lost
,I visit again the eternally ancient caves
,before a mighty Emperor thereupon came
,Watching the mortals discovering my chronicles
,guarded by the old demons even unknown to me
,Once destroyed their souls are being summoned to my timeless prison of hate
,It is delightful to feast upon the screaming souls that was destroyed in my future
,How many wizards that serve me with evil I know not
,My empires has no limits
,From the never ending mountains black
,to the bottomless lakes
,I am the ruler and has been for eternity's long
,From the never ending mountains black
,to the bottomless lakes
,I am the ruler and has been for eternity's long
,My wizards are many
,but their essence is mine
,Forever there are in the hills in their stone homes of grief
,Because I am the spirit of their existence
,I am them
,
,Orgy of silence, conspiracy of peace.
,Only the sound of the cold northern breeze.
,Twinsun sink fading behind the black lake.
,Asleep is the mountains, yet the night is awake.
,Strange is the night. Now black stars rise.
,And many Moons circle through silent the night.
,(Guitar solo)
,Along the black mountainside, scattered
,by the campfires awaiting the dawn.
,Two times a hundred men in battles.
,Tried by the steel in the arrow, axe and the sword.
,By battle worn, hunger torn, awaiting
,for the Sun to break through the cold haze
,and for the banners of Ebal to appear
,on the hill in the Sun's first warm rays.
,The elder among the men looked deep into
,the fire and spoke loud with pride.
,Tomorrow is a fine day to die.
,(Guitar solo) SOLO
,Now the morning advance from far East.
,Now the Sun breaks through dustclouds and haze.
,Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
,and steel shines bright in the Sun's first rays.
,(Guitar solo) SOLO
,Die.
,Die.
,Die.
I've seen her blood flow, as her head fell on the ground
and her sigh, I won't forget that sound.
The people around, they were scared and they all cried,
as they all bore witness how she died.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)

And then overnight it turned out that all was wrong,
that my sentence was a crying shame.
I realise now that all I believed was false,
all my errors, I'm the one to blame.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)

"Madness overcomes, you'll regret what you have done.
Haunted by my ghost, there's no place to hide, my dear,
your life, my dear, is mine I swear!"

She's coming back to take my life,
I'm sorry for all I have done to you, oh yeah...
She's coming, she's coming to take my life,
She's coming, she's coming, she takes my life.

He seemed far away, like he was focused on inside,
who could have ever read what's on his mind.
It seemed like he felt all the guilt he made alive,
a too heavy burden for his life.

An eye for an eye and all the tears she'd cried.
It's an eye for any eye, she comes to me, now I must die
(tonight)

,Thousands of cities from home
,Wander into the unknown
,Chances are here I was told
,Crossing the footsteps of new and of old
,Recurring smiles in the air
,Sky blue and life full of cheer
,Stories of people unfold
,And all we'd imagined is here
,Travel on into the dawn
,Where memories grow
,Sway along with all the names
,That this life may hold
,It's the little things little things
,Laugh through the night
,Through the crowd
,Till the end of the road
,Travel on beyond the dawn
,Where everyone knows
,Faces familiar
,A place I'd call home
,If there's anything anything
,I'd ask about in the end
,Where will I wake up tomorrow

,Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
,Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
,Brown paper packages tied up with strings
,These are a few of my favorite things
,Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
,Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
,Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
,These are a few of my favorite things
,Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
,Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
,Silver white winters that melt into springs
,These are a few of my favorite things
,When the dog bites
,when the bee stings
,When I'm feeling sad
,I simply remember my favorite things
,And then I don't feel so bad

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,You＇ll take my life but I＇ll take yours too
,You＇ll fire your musket but I＇ll run you through
,So when you＇re waiting for the next attack
,You＇d better stand there＇s no turning back.
,The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
,But on this battlefield no one wins
,The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
,As I plunge on into certain death.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
,The mighty roar of the Russian guns
,And as we race towards the human wall
,The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
,We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
,And the Russians fire another round
,We get so near yet so far away
,We won＇t live to fight another day.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,We get so close near enough to fight
,When a Russian gets me in his sights
,He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
,A burst of rounds take my horse below.
,And as I lay there gazing at the sky
,My body＇s numb and my throat is dry
,And as I lay forgotten and alone
,Without a tear I draw my parting groan.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,There′s a darkened sky before me
,There′s no time to prepare
,
,Salvage a last horizon
,But no regrets from me
,Maybe I′ll be back some other day
,
,To live again just who can say
,
,In what shape or form that I might be
,Just another chance for me
,A hurried time no disgrace
,Instead of racing to conclusion
,And wishing all my life away
,No-one can stop me now
,Time is up it couldnt last
,But there′s more things I′d like to do

,When The Wild Wind Blows

,That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
,Have you heard, have you heard?
,
,He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
,He could feel tension in the atmosphere
,He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
,Does it matter they survive somehow
,They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
,They said there's nothing you can do at all
,To sit and wait around for something to occur
,Did you know, did you know?
,
,As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
,Wonders if they'll ever grow again
,The desperation of the situation getting graver
,Getting ready when the wild wind blows
,
,Have you seen what they said on the news today
,Have you heard what they said about us all
,Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
,Have you heard, have you heard?
,There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen

,He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
,Good to have because you never know

,Iron Maiden  - Fear Of The Dark
,
,I am a man who walks alone
,And when I'm walking a dark road
,At night or strolling through the park
,
,When the light begins to change
,I sometimes feel a little strange
,A little anxious when it's dark.
,Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
,I have constant fear that something's always near
,I have a phobia that someone's always there
,Have you run your fingers down the wall
,And have you felt your neck skin crawl
,When you're searching for the light ?
,Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
,At the corner of the room
,You've sensed that something's watching you.
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a constant fear that something's always near
,I have a phobia that someone's always there.
,Have you ever been alone at night
,Thought you heard footsteps behind
,And turned around and no-one's there ?
,And as you quicken up your pace
,You find it hard to look again
,Because you're sure there's someone there
,SOLO
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  xN
,Watching horror films the night before
,Debating witches and folklore
,The unknown troubles on your mind
,Maybe your mind is playing tricks
,You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
,On dancing shadows from behind.
,When I'm walking a dark road
,
,I'm waiting in my cold cell
,when the bell begins to chime
,Reflecting on my past life
,and it doesn't have much time
,'Cuase at 5 o'clock they take me
,to the Gallows Pole
,The sands of time for me are running low
,Running low……Yeah！
,When the priest comes to read me the last rites
,I take a look through the bars at the last sights
,Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
,Can it be there's been some sort of an error
,Hard to stop the surmounting terror
,Is it really the end not some crazy dream
,Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
,It's not easy to stop from screaming
,But words escape me when I try to speak
,Tears they flow but why am I crying?
,After all am I not afraid of dying
,Don't believe that there never is an end
,As the guards march me out to the courtyard
,Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
,If there's a God then why has he let me die?
,As I walk all my life drifts before me
,And though the end is near I'm not sorry
,Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away
,Mark my words believe my soul lives on
,Don't worry now that I have gone
,I've gone beyond to see the truth
,When you know that your time is close at hand
,Maybe then you'll begin to understand
,Life down there is just a strange illusion
,Yeah, yeah, yeah,
,Hallowed be Thy name
,Yeah, yeah, yeah,
,Hallowed be Thy name
,Yeah～～～！！！

,Make his fight on the hill in the early day
,Constant chill deep inside
,
,Shooting gun' on they run through the endless grey
,On they fight' for they are right' yes' but who's to say?
,For a hill' men would kill' why? They do not know
,Suffered wounds test their pride
,Men of five' still alive through the raging glow
,Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
,
,For whom the bell tolls
,Time marches on
,
,For whom the bell tolls
,
,Take a look at the sky just before you die
,
,It's the last time he will
,
,Blackened roar' massive roar fillsthe crumbling sky
,
,Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
,
,Stranger now' are his eyes' to this mystery
,
,He hears the silence so loud
,
,Crack of dawn' all is gone except the will to be
,
,Now they see what will be' blindeed eyes to see

,What  we've  got  here  is  failure  to  communicate

,Well  he  gets  it!

,Look  at  the  lives  we're  leading

,My  hands  are  tied
,The  billions  shift  from  side  to  side
,And  the  wars  go  on  with  brainwashed  pride
,For  the  love  of  God  and  our  human  rights
,And  all  these  things  are  swept  aside
,By  bloody  hands  time  can't  deny
,And  are  washed  away  by  your  genocide
,And  history  hides  the  lies  of  our  civil  wars
,D'you  wear  a  black  armband
,When  they  shot  the  man
,Who  said  Peace  could  last  forever
,And  in  my  first  memories
,They  shot  Kennedy
,I  went  numb  when  I  learned  to  see
,So  I  never  fell  for  Vietnam
,We  got  the  wall  of  D  C  to  remind  us  all
,That  you  can't  trust  freedom
,When  it's  not  in  your  hands
,When  everybody's  fightin'

,And  I  don't  want  to  hear  no  more
,My  hands  are  tied
,For  all  I've  seen  has  changed  my  mind

,But my heart remains the same to you
,Time may change your heart
,My love for you never changes
,You say anything 傷つけ合う言葉でも
,Say anything 断ち切れない心に
,You say anything… Say anything
,Now you''ve gone away
,Where can I go from here?
,Say anything…Say anything…
,"I believed if time passes'
,everything truns into beauty
,If the rains stop' tears clean
,the scars of memory away
,Everything wearing fresh colors
,Every sound begins playing a heartful melody
,Jealousy embelishes a page of the epic
,Desire is embraced in a dream
,But my mind is still in chaos and..."
,何処に行けばいい 貴方と離れて
,今は過ぎ去った 時流に問い掛けて
,長すぎた夜に 旅立ちを夢見た
,異国の空見つめて 孤独を抱きしめた
,流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
,終わらない貴女の 吐息を感じて
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,Lonelines- Your silent whisper
,fills a river of tears Through the night
,Memory- You never let me cry
,And you,you never said good-bye
,Sometimes our tears blinded the love
,We lost our dreams along the way
,But I never thought You'd trade your soul to the fates
,Never thought You'd leave me alone
,Time through the rain has set me free
,Sands of time will keep your memory
,Love everlasting fades away
,Alive within your beatless heart
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
,終わらない悲しみを 青い薔薇に変えて
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
,終わらない貴方の 吐息を感じて
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,Dry your tears with love
,If you could have told me everything
,You would found what love is
,If you could have told me What was on your mind
,I would have shown you the way
,Someday I'm gonna be older than you
,I've never thought beyond that time
,I've never imagined the picture of that life
,For now I will try to live for you, and for me
,I will try to live with love, with dreams
,And forever with tears ...
,
,I could not look back
,You'd gone away from me
,I felt my heart ache
,I was afraid of following you
,When I had looked at
,The shadows on the wall
,I started running into the night
,To find the truth in me
,嵐吹くこの街が
,お前を抱く
,吹き抜ける風にさえ
,目を閉じる
,お前は走り出す
,何かに追われるよう
,俺が見えないのか
,すぐそばにいるのに
,人波に消えて行く
,記憶の吐息
,愛のない一人舞台
,もう耐えきれない
,All of you in my memory
,Is still shining in my heart
,すれ違う心は
,溢れる涙に濡れ
,紅に染まったこの俺を
,慰める奴はもういない
,もう二度と届かない
,この思い
,閉ざされた愛に向い
,叫びつづける

,
,Desert Rose Why do you live alone
,If you are sad I'll make you leave this life
,Are you white, blue or bloody red
,All I can see is drowning in cold grey sand
,The winds of time
,You knock me to the ground
,I'm dying of thirst
,I wanna run away
,I don't know how to set me free to live
,My mind cries out feeling pain
,I've been roaming to find myself
,How long have I been feeling endless hurt
,Falling down, rain flows into my heart
,In the pain I'm waiting for you
,Can't go back
,No place to go back to
,Life is lost, flowers fall
,If it's all dreams
,Now, wake me up
,If it's all real
,Just kill me
,I'm making the wall inside my heart
,I don't wanna let my emotions get out
,It scares me to look at the world
,Don't want to find myself lost in your eyes
,I tried to drown my past in grey
,I never wanna feel more pain
,Ran away from you without saying any words
,What I don't wanna lose is love
,Through my eyes
,Time goes by like tears
,My emotion's losing the color or life
,Kill my heart
,Release all my pain
,I'm shouting out loud
,Insanity takes hold over me
,Turning away from the wall
,Nothing I can see
,The scream deep inside
,reflecting another person in my heart
,He calls me from within
,"All existence you see before you must be wiped out
,Dream, Reality, Memories, and Yourself"
,I begin to lose control of myself
,My lust is so blind, destroys my mind
,Nobody can stop my turning to madness
,No matter how you try to hold me in your heart
,Why do you wanna raise these walls
,I don't know the meaning of hatred
,My brain gets blown away hearing words of lies
,I only want to hold your love
,Stab the dolls filled with hate
,Wash yourself with their blood
,Drive into the raging current of time
,Swing your murderous weapon into the belly "the earth"
,Shout and start creating confusion
,Shed your blood for pleasure
,And what? For love?
,What am I supposed to do?
,I believe in the madness called "Now"
,Past and future prison my heart
,Time is blind,
,But I wanna trace my love
,on the wall of time, over pain in my heart
,Art of life,
,Insane blade stabbing dreams
,Try to break all truth now
,But I can't heal this broken heart in pain
,Cannot start to live, cannot end my life
,Keep on crying
,Close my eyes
,Time breathes I can hear
,All love and sadness melt in my heart
,Dry my tears
,Wipe my bloody face
,I wanna feel me living my life outside my walls
,You can't draw a picture of yesterday, so
,You're painting your heart with your blood
,You can't say ”No”
,Only turning the wheel of time with a rope around your neck
,You build a wall of morality and take a breath
,from between the bricks
,You make up imaginary enemies and are chased by them
,You're trying to commit suicide
,You're satisfied with your prologue
,Now you're painting your first chapter black
,You are putting the scraps of life together
,and trying to make an asylum for yourself
,You're hitting a bell at the edge of the stage and
,You are trying to kill me
,I believe in the madness called "Now"
,Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
,Wanna live
,Can't let my heart kill myself
,Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
,Art of life
,I try to stop myself
,But my heart goes to destroy the truth
,Tell me why
,I want the meaning of my life
,Do I try to live, do I try to love in my dream
,I'm breaking the wall inside my heart
,I just wanna let my emotions get out
,Nobody can stop
,I'm running to freedom
,No matter how you try to hold me in your world
,Like a doll carried by the flow of time
,I sacrificed the present moment for the future
,I was in chains of memory half-blinded
,Losing my heart, walking in the sea of dreams
,Close my eyes
,Rose breathes I can hear
,All love and sadness melt in my heart
,Dry my tears
,Wipe my bloody face
,I wanna feel me living my life outside my mind
,Dreams can make me mad
,I can't leave my dream
,I can't stop myself
,Don't know what I am
,What lies are truth?
,What truths are lies?
,I believe in the madness called ”Now”
,Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
,Wanna live
,Can't let my heart kill myself
,Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
,Art of life
,I try to stop myself
,But my heart goes to destroy the truth
,Tell me why
,I want the meaning of my life
,Do I try to live, do I try to love
,Art of life,
,An Eternal Bleeding heart
,You never wanna breathe your last
,Wanna live
,Can't let my heart kill myself
,Still I'm feeling for
,A Rose is breathing love in my life
,
,Watching the stars.. till they're gone
,Like an actor all alone
,Who never knew the story he was in
,Who never knew the story ends
,Like the sky reflecting my heart
,All the colors become visible
,When the morning begins
,I'll read last line
,終わらない雨 抱きしめた 夜が朝を向かえる
,心はまだ濡れたまま
,In endless rain I've been walking
,Like a poet feeling pain
,Trying to find the answers
,Trying to hide the tears
,But it was just a circle
,That never ends
,When the rain stops, I'll turn the page
,The page of the first chapter
,傷つくだけ 傷ついて 解ったはずの答えを
,どうしてまだ 問いかけてる
,Am I wrong to be hurt
,Am I wrong to feel pain
,Am I wrong to be in the rain
,Am I wrong to wish the night won't end
,Am I wrong to cry
,But I know It's not wrong to sing the last song
,Cause forever fades
,気がつけば又 独り夜の空を見つめてる
,少しづつ消えて行く Our Memories
,傷つくだけ 傷ついて 解ったはずの答えを
,どうしてまだ 問いかけてる
,I see red
,I see blue
,But the silver lining gradually takes over
,When the morning begins
,I'll be in the next chapter

,「涙のない世界にも
,その橋は架かりますか?」
,壁に刻まれた落書きは
,ダレカの字によく似てた
,悲しみを遠ざけることで
,君は 橋を架けようとした
,けれど 今 傘を捨てて 目をつぶる
,だいじょうぶ
,大丈夫だよ 見上げればもう
,大丈夫ほら 七色の橋
,涙を流し終えた君の空に
,ねぇ見えるでしょ 色鮮やかに
,僕にも見える 君と同じの
,絆という名の虹が架かったね
,そして
,二つの空がやっと やっと 一つになって
,僕らを走らせるんだ

Once upon a time there was a tavern,
Where we used to raise a glass or two.
Remember how we laughed away the hours,
think of all the great things we would do.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.
Lalala lah lala, lalala lah lala
Just tonight I stood before the tavern,
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,
Was that lonely soldier really me.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.
Lalala lah lala, lalala lah lala
Through the door there came familiar laughter.
I saw your face and heard you call my name.
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser,
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same.
Those were the days my friend,
We thought they'd never end,
We'd sing and dance for-ever and a day,
We'd live the life we choose,
We'd fight and never lose,
For we were young and sure to have our way.

,There lived a certain man in Russia, long ago
,He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
,Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
,But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
,He could preach the Bible like a preacher
,Full of ecstasy and fire

,There was a cat that really was gone

,It was a shame, how he carried on
,He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
,But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
,In all affairs of state he was the man to please
,But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
,For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
,Though she'd heard the things he'd done
,She believed, he was a holy healer
,Who would heal her son
,repeat
,But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
,For power became known to more and more people
,The demands to do something about
,This outrageous man became louder and louder
,"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
,But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
,No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
,Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
,Then one night, some men of higher standing
,Set a trap, they're not to blame
,"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
,And he really came
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,They put some poison into his wine
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Russia's greatest love machine

,I will reverse my mistakes, pain - fade away
,Fade away

,All these sources of noise are whispering and screaming
,Tempting and frightening in the middle of my head, beyond my heart
,They try to change my mind into something bad
,Fighting against them for years
,But in the end I still decide on my own
,Fearing the mistakes
,Fearing the responsibility

,Then they'll march you with a smile into the ground
,And we all go to heaven in a little row boat
,So put your hands up, put your hands up
,If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,We'll fight until we die, this ain't ever gonna stop
,This stray dog world, this sick sad place
,Got a belly full of maggots and disease
,Every apple here is rotten, every blessing is a curse
,Every word is a lie you best believe
,We take one step forward, then two steps back
,In a race to the bottom of the barrel
,They teach us how to fear
,They teach us how to hate
,Then they arm us and they march us off to hell
,And its left, left, left right left
,So put your hands up, put your hands up
,If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,If crawling for the scraps won't ever be enough
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,We'll fight until we die, this ain't ever gonna stop
,Because they came for our minds
,We said nothing
,They came for our hopes
,We said nothing
,They came for our souls
,And still we said nothing
,Now they're coming for our lives
,So what's it gonna take
,What's it gonna take
,See how they run, see how they run
,So put your hands up, put your hands up
,If clawing for the scraps won't ever be enough
,Put your hands up, put your hands up
,The writing's on the wall, this ain't ever gonna stop
,Put your hands up, put your hands up

You all know the fucking score 
Everybody on the floor! 
Put your hands where 
I can see them 
We're not playing around 
One little move 
And you're in the ground 
We live on our own set of rules 
Take everything and everyone down with you 
We are a desperate kind 
But this is a ruthless time 
When I hit rock bottom 
I go looking friends in the filthiest places 
Yeah, yeah 
I make ends meat cause 
I'm a bad bad man 
When I hit rock bottom, the party has arrived 
We won't be taken alive 
What if they just shut the lights out 
So caught up in your digital world 
What happens now? 
What if they just shut the lights out 
And all the city lights go black 
What happens now? 
What if they just shut the lights out 
So caught up in your digital world 
What happens now? 
Lights out! 
You all know the fucking score 
Everybody on the floor! 
Put your hands where 
I can see them 
We're not fucking around! 
One little move and you're in the ground! 
Lights out!

,I'm not your true love, or your knight and shining armor
,All of these games you play, and all this bullshit drama
,I'll be free to be me and find my path in life
,You think I'll die alone?
,Well I'm not alone tonight
,Our love was a waste, this much is true.
,I pray I forget you
,Yeah!
,Fuck you!
,You're not better than anyone,
,You want respect you have to earn it
,Your jealousy won't fall on me
,Why are you so heartless?
,Open up you eyes and you'll see,
,That I'm not perfect,
,That's what I'm trying to be.
,Open up your eyes and you'll see,
,That I'm not perfect,
,That's what I'm trying to be,
,'Cause I know you're worth it.
,These new demons are changing me inside,
,Changing me inside.
,Lock me down to pick yourself back up,
,Because you hit the depths
,In your heart you're still lost
,Always sinking down
,I bet you'd put yourself through Hell.
,You did this to yourself.
,I can't believe I wished you well.
,I wished you well.
,Lock me down to pick yourself back up,
,Because you hit the depths.
,In your heart you're still lost;
,Always sinking down
,Open up your eyes and you'll see,
,That I'm not perfect,
,That's what I'm trying to be,
,'Cause I know you're worth it.
,These new demons are changing me inside,
,Changing me inside.
,These new demons,
,They're eating me alive.
,Pushing and pulling,
,The heart out from inside.
,If I can't have you,
,Then nobody else can now
,Just the thought of you,
,Walking hand in hand,
,With somebody else,
,Reinventing things we do,
,But they'll never match
,To the love thrown down the well
,If I can't have you,
,Then nobody else can...
,Then nobody else can
,nobody else can
,Then nobody else can
,Then nobody else can
,I'm searching for the meaning
,You said you'd be my everything
,I guess your words mean nothing
,So go and prove your loyalty
,Go ahead and bury me deep down inside
,Change that longing in your heart
,Hold that thought, just for a moment
,Let your heart feel numb
,Now I see that this is what you mean
,When you said you'd be my everything
,So go and prove your loyalty
,This is what you are
,You'll never take this
,This is what you'll get
,The separation
,This is who i am
,You'll never change me
,Loyalty
,Now I see that this is what you mean
,When you said you'd be my everything
,Now I see that this is what you mean
,When you said you'd be my everything
,So go and prove your loyalty
,Now I see that this is what you mean
,When you said you'd be my everything
,So go and prove your loyalty
I never made this clear but
I'm tired of waiting for the right moment to appear
I built my life on something not
So stable
And I've been falling ever since I was able to stand.
They say it's harder on your own and you know it's true
Now I'm ready to break through
I've spent all these years of my life begging for a plan that never came
So, I broke all the bones in my legs
and taught myself to stand alone again to become a better man
Because I hate who I was turning out to be
but I'm sure that this will not be the end of my suffering
I just thought it'd be easier
but now i know that I can't take it back
there's nothing you can do that will change the way i act
so the words will hang over me
"Just give it up there's no way you're gonna win"
It's never too late to pick yourself up and start again
Are we ever gonna change
This feelings taking over me
Every time I think I get it right
And I don't think I'll feel okay
If this ends with misery
But it's just another chance that
I'm willing to take tonight
Hoping that..
This would be easier

,
,We will tear it all apart
,Back, back in the days,
,how we started with so much faith?
,Did they forget what they said
,or was the change the end?
,The world may push you away
,But I will always stay
,Hoping you'll hold back as I gravitate towards you
,I cannot forget the devils that we met
,They put their fists in our throats
,Chewed all the things we held close
,And crammed our minds with misinformation
,My voice dies in the white noise between us
,My heart is now your sun
,RADIATE NOW!
,We will tear it all apart
,Burn it to the GROUND!
,The world may push you away
,As the turns it change
,The place we use to know
,We have to let it go
,The world may push you away
,But I will always stay
,Hoping you'll hold back as I gravitate towards you
,We started this for these reasons,
,Now they want to walk away hands clean
,It's a shame if the soil beneath you has nothing left and we said
,We will not forget.(Can we not forget)
,I cannot forget the devils that we met
,I cannot,
,I cannot pretend!
,I cannot pretend, I cannot pretend, I cannot pretend
,IT DIDN'T FUCKIN HAPPEN!
,They pump our veins with all their fancy drugs
,They roll the dice to test our fleeting luck.
,(Test our fleeting luck)
,They lift us just to throw us back down
,Enjoy the party you will never make us proud.
,(It's all so clear from here.)
,(I will join you now, I know you'll make me proud!!)
,The world may push you away

Infected, rabid flesh
Revenge for, acid death
Frothed-deathrage
Tortured-Fleshcrave
Hippie crazed cult
Rabid bloodshed
MassacredChopped and hacked
Mass bloodshed
Rabid death
Scale the inferno,
Take it all in
Am i right or wrong, or just confused?
Glamorized, dare i say it?
Fantasized, but through who's eyes?
Not theirs, that's for sure!
Rebuff beliefs that we've lost.
A plague rages in all our hearts.
Am i the last in line?
To stop and turn,
And pretend that we're really changing.
I'd sooner die.......
Lest we forget scorched earth policies
Of megaton and hydrogen
And taut muscle of an armory that flexes
To show the world we mean business
It's all smiles and handshakes
But who moves to disarm?
We've cheapened time and evolution
To be violently erased is non-fiction
Those summits and peace treaties
Are just worthless words
It's all smiles and handshakes
But who moves to disarm?
Radium, uranium
One more isotope to add the collection
The age of outrage
Has been reasoned into submission
And cries for peace are no longer in fashion
I wonder if we'll see the point through cataracted eyes
Or draw breath from irradiated lungs
And sigh as we exit times seven
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle sale morue,
Ou t'auras ma bite dans ton cul!
Va faire à bouffer grosse teupu,
Ou je vais encore t'éclater le cul.
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle
Va faire la vaisselle sale morue,
Ou t'auras ma bite dans ton cul!
Va faire à bouffer grosse teupu,
Ou je vais encore t'éclater le cul.
Taking away all human rights
Terror is the plan
Sever ties of decency
Dagger in hand
Pre-Chorus:
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay
Chorus:
(Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty)
Stabbing at the liberties
Of people like you and I
Faith holds a special reason
Of telling why they die
Pre-Chorus:
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay
Chorus:
(Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty)
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Promise of an afterlife
Can you feed the appetite?
Taking creed out of the picture
What do you see?
A lunatic with an altered sense
Of life's reality
Pre-Chorus:
Promise of an afterlife
If it feeds the appetite
Reeking of death and decay
Chorus:
(Beating on the door of vengeance
You'll never get away
Not this time
No Amnesty) 

Before Christ in a time of fear
Ideas and faith reinforce with a spear
With the crescent ruling
Flesh by flesh
Non-believers perished
Now you can see
It's ideology
Creed is gone
It's their permanent reality
(Solo - Chavez)
Lie to the people
Those who speak see no evil
Loss of power is not an option
Surrender your spirits to us
Thirsty to reign
Everything to lose, but nothing to gain
It's ultimate supremacy
Control is maintained
(CHORUS)
Whipping, torture, killing, rotting
I have seen the abuse
Whipping, torture, killing, rotting
Rotten
Time to act
As I hear their screams
I've lost touch with reality
Killing is my specialty
Dark and hollow, I feel no sorrow
For the victims at my blade
I feel nothing as I piece their brains
(Solo - Chavez)
Lie to the people
Those who speak see no evil
Loss of power is not an option
Surrender your spirits to us
Thirsty to reign
Everything to lose, but nothing to gain
It's ultimate supremacy
Control is maintained
(CHORUS)
(Solo - Sanchez) 

Got your back against the wall
No time left, no time to stall
Life is about to shoot
But you don't know when, you don't know who
Under the gun
Under pressure and anxiety
You gotta find a way
Under the gun
Or there is hell to pay
Under the gun
Eventually...
Gotta do what you gotta do
Doing what does not belong
Doing what you know is wrong
Pressure building up to critical mass
Trying not to break the hourglass
,
Got no room to make mistakes
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Life is about to shoot
But you don't know when, you don't know who

Starving out the many while I only feed the few
Maintain the wealth that keeps me in control of you
Clean on the surface so you won't see my deceit
Even though I'm slithering just beneath your feet
Extend my reign into foreign lands
Flexing my muscle anywhere I can
I keep the power and swallow you whole
Cutting off your life support, I follow through
From way up here my vision's distorted
Cannot maintain what I once supported
I keep you safe, secure and protected
Until my self-indulgence has been perfected
I am the state
I decide your fate
Deliver to all
I bring the downfall
Making up your mind is everything I do
Doing the right thing is never up to you
Get you on board only to betray your trust
I will cut you off when I say you've had enough
,

作曲 : Iacono, Kataklysm
  Where is this paradise?
 This heaven you call my life!
 Don't test my patience
 Just to give it one more chance...
 To believe that destiny could change...
 To believe that I can tame this rage
 I'm lost inside this world...
 I'm lost inside myself...
 
 No more...resistance. No more...truthful essence
 No more...substance. No more...meaningful lessons
 
 Don't try to justify the life you crucified
 All the lies are written in the skies
 I'm immortal but ready to die!
 
 Watch the angels fall, they drop tears of blood
 I think my life is fading away. Yes...I'm swept away
 
 Serenity in fire
 
 My heart one with the dark, my soul trapped and gridlocked
 
 Serenity in fire
 
 Spread your wings...as I strike them down!
 I'll strike them down!!
 
 I'm lost inside this world...I'm lost inside myself
 No one can change this world. You made hell
 
 No more...resistance
 No more...truthful essence
 No more...substance
 No more...meaningful lessons
 
 Don't try to justify the life you crucified
 All the lies are written in the skies
 I'm immortal but ready to die!
 
 I'll strike you down! 

作曲 : Iacono, Kataklysm
The tragedy 
I preachIs every thing you see
And everything you breath
Make way for all the dreams that can be held
Make way for all minds that can be fed
There's a cost for serenity, there's a cost to live freely
This stress is endless bring down the careless
It's coming down, it's coming down
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy, all the things we feel
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy, everything that's real
Master the mind
Master the earth's swine
Forever invoke what makes you right
And dissolve what makes you blind
Step back from the enemy within
Step back from that endless grin
There's a cost for serenity, there's a cost to live freely
This stress is endless bring down the careless
It's coming down, it's coming down
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy, all the things we feel
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy, everything that's real
Master the mind
Master the earth's swine
Forever invoke what makes you right
And dissolve what makes you blind

See the gates are closing
Elimination waits
Deeming you unlift for the life just because I decide
To constantly remind you
That there's a reason why
This is where the strongest give and all the weakest die
Separate
Defective and unequal
Clean slate
But it's so unnatural
Showing indifference
Mocking perfection
Struggle for existence
Unnatural selection
Displayed above your head
Feeding you the lie
Putting you to work to profit off of your demise
Systematic servitude
Work will set you free
Arbitrary suffering, infinite misery
,

Take a number and have a seat
We'll be with you shortly
Plead your case: appeal to me
I'll be judge and jury
On your feet for sentencing

Your time is up
Time is up
Your time is up
Time is up

Follow me into the void
Of emptiness that fills your mind
Think of all the bullshit
You will get to leave behind
On your feat for sentencing

Your time is up
Time is up
Your time is up
Time is up
Praying I'm not the next one at the front of the line
Ghastly voices telling me I have to stay alive
I cannot remember one day I didn't kill
Their weakening faces haunt me forever, still
Chorus:
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"
Victims lie dead, shot to the head, spitting blood back in their face
Gathering strength to make memories fade
Of the fabled master race
Peace: a part of the future
War: a thing of the past
Can this be reality...
Or just a favor no man can ask?
Chorus:
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"
Glad to be the last one at the back of the line
Ghastly voices telling me I had to stay alive
I cannot remember one day I didn't kill
Their weakening faces haunt me forever, still
Chorus:
Piercing through the flesh, tearing the wounds open more
Cutting them down, one by one
Consequences are for those who do not reign supreme
Killing for life I scream, "Covering fire!"
作曲 : ?
Executioner
Brutal killing machine
Misanthropic warrior
Aggressive, vicious fiend
Emotionless butcher
Slayer with axe in hand
Merciless mutilator
Kill 'em all, cleanse the land
Evil - Kill, kill and kill again
Evil - Kill, kill until the end
Red rivers of blood
Heaps of severed heads
Endless fields of corpses
Mountains of limbs, piles of dead
Torture, torment, terror
Carnage, annihilation
Murder, mayhem, massacre
Total death, extermination
Evil - Kill, kill and kill again
Evil - Kill, kill until the end
Evil - Kill, kill and kill again
Evil - Kill, kill until the end
Nothing will ever stop me
The final war has begun
Nothing will ever stop me
Evil Unleashed! Kill everyone
Evil - Kill, kill and kill again
Evil - Kill, kill until the end
Evil - Kill, kill and kill again
Evil - Kill, kill until the end

,バスを待つ彼女はなんだかちょっとくたびれてる
,お母さんのこととか保険のこととか色々ね
,風に舞う 髪を撫でて 耳にかけると
,その輪郭にハッとする男 通りの向こう
,
,僕たち顔を見なくなってもうどれくらい？
,5年とか いや10年前 夜の防波堤
,僕らはガキ 君は天使 ネイビーブルーのワンピース
,湾の向こう工場がゆらゆら光ってた
,
,彼女ってば 彼の何かを勘ぐって
,ねえ行こうよって走り出す
,空には月が輝いていて
,テトラポットが波を砕く
,
,話しかけるべきか躊躇してる間にバスは来た
,どうなるか彼はわかってた まあ別にいいのさ
,でもさあもし 窓越しに 彼を見つけたら
,きっと話したげな顔するはずだけど
,
,バスに乗った彼女はバッグを膝の上に抱き
,歯医者さんの予約をしなきゃと外を眺めていた
,カーブを曲がり 街路樹の隙間で目があった
,その瞬間にハッとする男 通りの向こう
,
,彼ったら
,もう間に合わないってわかってるのに息切らして走り出す
,後悔になんて唾を吐け
,いつかの天使が笑ってる
,
,僕は未だにあの夏の
,夜のことをよく思い出す
,空には月が輝いていて
,テトラポットが波を砕く
,
,またね
,またね

,思ってたより長い時間が
,ただ過ぎていた alone in my car
,どこまで走っても見つからなくて
,Gotta face the fact 想い出滲んでく
,離さない 誓ったのに
,Didn't know the miracle 消えてしまうなんて
,君の全て 優しく抱いて
,Someday この路の向こうまで
,もう一度ふたりの未来を重ねよう
,夢の続きを諦めたくない
,Baby give me one more chance
,一緒に笑う朝を迎えたい
,Don't you know 君との絆を knockin' on the door
,大切にしたい
,From the bottom of my heart
,手を繋げたらまた始めたい
,Back in love again
,ふと気付いたら静けさの中
,君を探してた alone in my car
,隣ではしゃいだり口ずさんだり
,賑やかな毎日に慣れてた
,窓の外流れてゆく
,景色は何も変わらないけれど
,君の全て もう一度抱いて
,For you 今なら強くなれる
,この広い世界で巡り会えた奇跡
,夢の続き描けたはずなのに
,Baby give me one more chance
,一緒に眠る夜を灯したい
,Don't you know
,君との時間を knockin' on the door
,刻み続けたい
,From the bottom of my heart
,たったひとつの願いを胸に
,君と出会った場所は
,懐かしい風が薫っていた
,ここから start over again
,守るよ from all the pain

,Jeden Tag, von früh bis spät,
,Wenn ich die gewohnten Runden dreh,
,bin ich eigentlich zufrieden mit mir selbst.
,Doch ab und da denke ich spontan,
,die Routine hindert mich daran,
,der zu sein der ich wirklich bin.
,Dann sammle und besinn ich mich,
,auf den Moment und innerlich stell ich mich vorne an den Beckenrand.
,Und ich brech aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie der Puls in meinen Adern wieder bebt.
,Und ich brech aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie die Kälte meinen Geist wieder belebt
,Ich fahre raus zum alten Bad und ich nehm das schöne alte Rad,
,das ich mal am Wegesrand gefunden hab.
,Durch das Loch am alten Zaun
,und dann noch vorbei am großen Baum
,und an der verblühten Wiese bleib ich steh'n.
,Ohhh dann sammle und besinn ich mich
,auf den Moment und stelle mich bis ganz nach vorne an den Beckenrand.
,Und ich breche aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie der Puls in meinen Adern wieder bebt.
,Ich breche aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie die Kälte meinen Geist wieder belebt.
,Ich breche aus, spring ins kalte aus und sinke bis zum Grund.
,Und ich tauche auf.
,Und ich tauche auf.
,Ich breche aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie der Puls in meinen Adern wieder bebt.
,Ich breche aus, spring ins kalte Wasser,
,spüre wie die Kälte meinen Geist wieder belebt.

That girl ooh, that girl ooh, that girl, that girl, that girl
Ooh that girl, that girl, that girl, oh talk about that girl that girl
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That girl, that girl, that girl...
Say look at me baby, I've been looking at you too
Trying to understand the thing that you want MJ to do
Ain't it funny how the time easily slips away
I've been thinking about you sugar every moment every day
And we lay upon the beach we can each get cosy
On the other end where the people don't know me
Show me, any little thing that you feel like
Let me know the spot that gets you hot and make it feel right
Introduce some plans, to the elementary game
We can be connected with a number and a name
Strange how women make you chase them for awhile
Then when you approach them they get timid like a child
Ain't no sugar in my tank, no deductions in my bank
Never never, mad mad this steels to clever
But I'm trying to get her on a trip of my world
Seven days, six nights -- that girl
That girl, that girl knows that shes so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl)
Take a nigga baby can we get out, go oversea
Don't mind at the house bring you body with me
I've been really taking notes on the way that you maintain
You're one out of akind entitled to the same thing
Opportunity knocks for you girl let it be
Yet it don't stop to the&nbsp;?
I know you've wondering how long could it last
But trust in the future and let the day be the past
I'm taking you dancing, you've just got good legs
But all I vision is some real good times
That we could be having in the blink of an eye
Impossible dream we can achieve if we try
It's the brother who cut for youMentally and physically
What would it take for you, do you really want to get with G's
My mission to hold my angel my pearl
But we still live as strangers -- that girl
That girl, that girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I should surely be her man (that girl, that girl)
You look marvellous in your jeans, that queen
Thinking about the entrance you made at the club scene
You know you're looking goodSo I just let it ride
Too many in the hood that have already tried
They said you be looking for things I can't produce
Like a fast life, and quick dreams
To tell you the truth, competiton is blowing my hustle about position
Concidences keep us apart
It's hard to listen to somebody that you don't even trust
you don't know
Places that I want you to come, you don't go
Half all playing the game of cat and mouse
But before you start running your mouth or getting out
You don't want a man, you want somebody to play with
Knowing it's impossible for you to stay with
So real don't forget that I said
Probem is went to her head
That girl knows that she's so fine
I've got to have her in my life (that girl, that girl)
What could I do to make her understand
That I could surely be her man (that girl, that girl) x2
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)
I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Girl if you don't want to (don't want to)
I won't force you (force you)
I want to find someone who wants to be right here right in my world
I want you (I want you)I want to see you (I want to see you)

作曲 : Brooks, Robinson, Smith
Yeah, it's the return of three drunk mothafuckas
Huh, yeah, it's Tha Liks
We gots Stan the guitar man in the house
Mothaclucka, uh, uh
,
I'm sick like a sore throat swallow, drunk act to follow
I'll make the whole bottle hollow (what a ride!)
Rollin' wit' a open container, and one in the chamber
Ten Likwit CD's in the changer
Bettin' wages on the Lakers; yo' squad is in danger
Hoes go two ways these days like my pager
Say Hoe, my name is J-Ro, oh, you didn't know? (no)
Well, fuck you then!
I hang with cats, who chase rats, and kick tats
Hit the eightball like Minnesota fats
Got more&nbsp;? than biceps, relax
Pure hoes jockin' in the studio flats
When I'm in the house, take off the wave cap for hats
Got scully from a hoochie, with lips like Da Brat
Raised in the valley of the shadow of death
So I fear none, time to anty up for the beer run
,
We are Tha Alkaholiks
It's last call, can we get anotha round?
We are Tha Alkaholiks
And I know ya like the way it's goin' down
,
So all the ladies to the Limo, it's Tha Alkaholik car pool
Lyrics bang from thirty feet to blow y'all niggas off your bar stool
We back, to wet'cha, the flawless, the wallus
Regardless of your colors, Tha Liks are Alkaholiks
,
We the same three niggas that be makin' the noise
Doin' donuts in Ferraris, like some drunk hot boys
,
Do or die fool! Straight from the home of where we spark from
Where the weed'll leave ya dizzy like a tranquelizer dart gun
The L, not to be confused with Tinsletown
Well, I made a million dollars off this shit I penciled down
Flashy Tashy, be gunnin' from the worsest alliance
And when I die, I'ma donate all my verses to science
Do the tango, while rappers get strangled by the lone-shark
You be ridin' niggas dick, that's why you never make your own mark
I'm sober and justice, why this is my year
Screamin' "Party over here, fuck y'all over there!"
(Party over here, fuck y'all over there!)
,
,
King Tee started it off, and then came Tha Liks
Then Xzibit added hot done proda to the mix
Then Defari, "Hey you!" Comin' through, Likwit Crew
And&nbsp;? gets the broom, who can sin it?
Who can sin it? Twisted and been it, but if the funk ain't in it
My DJ always submitted to spin it
If I said that I meant it, don't get'cha mouth pin it in&nbsp;?
We feelin' with a penny, represent it
,
Aiyyo re-pre-sent, yo', re-si-dence
If it don't say Likwit, then you won't get bent
Aiyyo, dollars and cents, make the world just awkward
Got niggas in the hood, livin' next to their doctor
I'm a rowdy, mic-rocker, since the age of twenty-two
In the video, flossin', like "This could be you"
Likwit Crew, do it up, 'til the wheels fall off
Unlike these other niggas that had it and lost it
We stayed in the game, stayed hot, turned up the flame

,
,I am a man who walks alone
,And when I'm walking a dark road
,At night or strolling through the park
,
,When the light begins to change
,I sometimes feel a little strange
,"I'm chilling,in the dark." "
,Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
,I have constant fear that something's always near
,Fear of the dark,fear of the dark
,
,I have a phobia that someone's always there
,Have you run your fingers down the wall
,And have you felt your neck skin crawl
,When you're searching for the light ?
,Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
,At the corner of the room
,You've sensed that something's watching you.
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a constant fear that something's always near
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a phobia that someone's always there.
,Have you ever been alone at night
,Thought you heard footsteps behind
,And turned around and no-one's there ?
,And as you quicken up your pace
,You find it hard to look again
,Because you're sure there's someone there
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a constant fear that something's always near
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a phobia that someone's always there.
,SOLO
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark xN
,Watching horror films the night before
,Debating witches and folklore
,The unknown troubles on your mind
,And thought your mind is playing tricks
,You sense,and suddenly eyes fix
,On dancing shadows from behind.
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a constant fear that something's always near
,Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
,I have a phobia that someone's always there.

,You＇ll take my life but I＇ll take yours too
,You＇ll fire your musket but I＇ll run you through
,So when you＇re waiting for the next attack
,You＇d better stand there＇s no turning back.
,The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
,But on this battlefield no one wins
,The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
,As I plunge on into certain death.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
,The mighty roar of the Russian guns
,And as we race towards the human wall
,The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
,We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
,And the Russians fire another round
,We get so near yet so far away
,We won＇t live to fight another day.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,We get so close near enough to fight
,When a Russian gets me in his sights
,He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
,A burst of rounds take my horse below.
,And as I lay there gazing at the sky
,My body＇s numb and my throat is dry
,And as I lay forgotten and alone
,Without a tear I draw my parting groan.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

,White man came across the sea
,He brought us pain and misery
,He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
,He took our game for his own need
,We fought him hard we fought him well
,Out on the plains we gave him hell
,But many came too much for cree
,Oh will we ever be set free?
,Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
,Galloping hard on the plains
,Chasing the redskins back to their holes
,Fighting them at their own game
,Murder for freedom a stab in the back
,Women and children and cowards attack
,Run to the hills run for your lives
,Run to the hills run for your lives
,Soldier blue on the barren wastes
,Hunting and killing their game
,Raping the women and wasting the men
,The only good indians are tame
,Selling them whisky and taking their gold
,Enslaving the young and destroying the old
,Run to the hills run for your lives
,Here is the soul of a man
,Here in this place for the taking
,Clothed in white, stand in the light
,Here is the soul of a man
,Time to speak with the shaman again
,Conjure the jester again
,Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
,So here is the soul of a man
,When the world was virgin
,Before the coming of men
,Just a solar witness
,The beginning of the end
,From a world of magma
,To a cold rock face
,The ascent of madness
,And a human race
,We are strange believers all of us
,There are stranger truths immortal lust
,We rise from slumber he calls our name
,Recalls our number abide with pain

,If eternity should fail
,Waiting in line for the ending of time
,If eternity should fail
,To god's illusion which I recall
,Was our delusion
,Before the fall
,The angels come and the angels go
,But the lord of light shining below
,Eternal blackness beyond the stars
,We think our wisdom will get that far
,At the master's table the table's bare
,No land of plenty, devastation, despair

,What did I see can I believe that what I saw

,Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
,reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
,Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
,and brings me to despair
,The night was black was no use holding back
,Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
,In the mist dark figures move and twist
,was all this for real or some kind of hell

,Hell and fire was spawned to be released
,Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
,as they start to cry hands held to the sky
,In the night the fires burning bright

,666 the Number of the Beast
,Sacrifice is going on tonight
,This can't go on I must inform the law
,Can this still be real or some crazy dream
,but I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
,they seem to mesmerise me...can't avoid their eyes
,666 the Number of the Beast
,666 the one for you and me
,I'm coming back I will return
,And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn

,Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
,See his eye as he stops one of three
,Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
,Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
,And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
,Caught by his spell and the Mariner tells his tale
,Driven south to the land of snow and ice
,To a place where nobody’s been
,Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
,Hailed in God’s name hoping good luck it brings
,And the ship sails on, back to the north
,Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on
,The mariner kills the bird of good omen
,His shipmates cry against what he’s done
,But when the fog clears, they justify him
,And make themselves a part of the crime
,Sailing on and on and North across the sea
,Sailing on and on and North `til all is calm
,The albatross begins with its vengeance
,A terrible curse a thirst has begun
,His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
,About his neck, the dead bird is hung
,And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
,And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
,“Day after day, day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion
,As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
,Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
,Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.”
,There, calls the Mariner there comes a ship over the line
,But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide
,See .....onward she comes
,Onward she nears, out of the sun
,See.... She has no crew
,She has no life, wait but there’s two
,Death and she life in Death
,they throw their dice for the crew
,She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
,Then... crew one by one
,They drop down dead, two hundred men
,She...She, Life in Death
,She lets him live, her chosen one
,MUSIC
,“One after one by the star dogged moon
,too quick for groan or sigh
,each turned his face with a ghastly pang
,and cursed me with his eye
,four times fifty living men
,and I heard nor sigh nor groan
,with heavy thump, a lifeless lump
,they dropped down one by one"
,The curse it lives on in their eyes
,The Mariner he wished he’d die
,Along with the sea creatures
,But they lived on, so did he
,And by the light of the moon
,He prays for their beauty not doom
,With heart he blesses them
,God’s creatures all of them too
,Then the spell starts to break
,The albatross falls from his neck
,Sinks down like lead into the sea
,Then down in falls comes the rain
,SOLO
,Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
,See them stir and they start to rise
,Bodies lifted by good spirits
,None of them speak and they’re lifeless in their eyes
,And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
,Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
,Now the curse is finally lifted
,And the Mariner sights his home
,Spirits go from the long dead bodies
,Form their own light and the Mariner’s left alone
,And then a boat came sailing towards him
,It was a joy he could not believe
,The pilots boat, his son and the hermit
,Penance of life will fall onto Him
,And the ship sinks like lead into the sea
,And the hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins
,The Mariner’s bound to tell of his story
,To tell his tale wherever he goes
,To teach God’s word by his own example
,That we must love all things that God made
,And the wedding guest’s a sad and wiser man
,And the tale goes on and on and on
,I'm waiting in my cold cell
,when the bell begins to chime
,Reflecting on my past life
,and it doesn't have much time
,'Cuase at 5 o'clock they take me
,to the Gallows Pole
,The sands of time for me are running low
,Running low……Yeah！
,When the priest comes to read me the last rites
,I take a look through the bars at the last sights
,Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
,Can it be there's been some sort of an error
,Hard to stop the surmounting terror
,Is it really the end not some crazy dream
,Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
,It's not easy to stop from screaming
,But words escape me when I try to speak
,Tears they flow but why am I crying?
,After all am I not afraid of dying
,Don't believe that there never is an end
,As the guards march me out to the courtyard
,Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
,If there's a God then why has he let me die?
,As I walk all my life drifts before me
,And though the end is near I'm not sorry
,Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away
,Mark my words believe my soul lives on
,Don't worry now that I have gone
,I've gone beyond to see the truth
,When you know that your time is close at hand
,Maybe then you'll begin to understand
,Life down there is just a strange illusion
,Yeah, yeah, yeah,
,Hallowed be Thy name
,Yeah, yeah, yeah,
,Hallowed be Thy name
,Yeah～～～！！！

,Walking through the city
,Looking oh so pretty
,I've just got to find my way
,See the ladies flashing
,All there legs and lashes
,Well you see me crawling
,through the bushes with it open wide
,What you seeing girl
,Can't you believe that feeling
,Can't you believe it
,Can't you believe your eyes
,It's the real thing girl
,Got me feeling myself and reeling around
,Got me talking but feel like walking around
,
,Solo
,Got me feeling myself and reeling a...
,Got me talking but nothing's with me...
,There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
,Thenes the sound of the guns sending flak
,Out for the scramble we've got to get airborn
,Got to get up for theing attack.
,Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
,Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste
,Gathering speed as we head down the runway
,Gotta get airborne before it's too late.
,Running, scrambling, flying
,Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
,Rolling, turning, diving
,Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
,Won't You?
,Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.
,Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
,Let of a sharp burst and then turn away
,Roll over, spin round toe in behind them
,Move to their blindsides and firing again.
,Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
,Ten ME-109's out of the sun
,Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
,Heading straight for them I press down my guns.
,Rolling, turning, diving
,Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
,Rolling, turning, diving
,Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
,Won't You?
,Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high.

We’re throwing down the gauntlet
Chomping at the bit about to lay down the law
Show you all the way
Bare witness to genesis
Of the violence the way it was back in the day.
We’ve been here from the start with a one track mind,
We kept the hate alive.
Always had the power, now is zero hour,
Tonight we’re gonna fight like it’s 1985.
,
Blood in, blood out,
All I’m telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out,
This is a fucking dynasty of trash notoriety.
Dive in or bow out,
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family.
All in or all out,
Half way, no way. Give it all you’ve got!
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed
Let’s see what you brought.
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out.
Stand tall, show you’ve got no backbone.
Welcome all who never took more than gave
Punish all deceptions, no exceptions
Fortune always favors the brave
Bring your anger,
Bring the mayhem,
Anything you do is allowed.
You’re the kings of pit insanity
Tonight we’re gonna rage and make Paul Baloff proud.
,
Blood in, blood out,
All I’m telling you is do anything you wanna do
Blood in, blood out,
This is a fucking dynasty of trash notoriety.
Dive in or bow out,
If you have the pedigree, welcome to the family.
All in or all out,
Half way, no way. Give it all you’ve got!
We wrote the book, so you better know the plot
New breed, old creed
Let’s see what you brought.
This shit has turned into a rout
Blood in, blood out.
We’re bringing down the thunder
Bottling the light, battering the way
Burning down the place
Our one stance, zero tolerance
Time to cut to the chase
We expect nothing less than a full scale riot
Give everything that you’ve got
Put an end to the peace and quiet
Let’s start the pit that time forgot.
,
Blood in, blood out,

,The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany purposed to research the history of the Aryan race.
,The Ahnenerbe conducted experiments and launched expeditions in an attempt to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.
,The name Ahnenerbe means "inheritance from the ancestors".
,The official mission of the Ahnenerbe was to find new evidence of the racial heritage.
,However,due to Himmler's obsession it quickly became his own occult tool and started using pseudoscience.
,The Institut fur Wehrwissenschaftliche Zweckforschung which conducted extensive medical experiments using human subjects became attached to the Ahnenerbe during World War II.

,Come experience hate like you never have before
,Spreading from the fallen Tower of Babel
,Bread and circuses means to keep us from the truth

,I'm born into this world of joy and misery
,Where all the things go 'round in circles
,The sense of life, it seems to be
,An unknown mystery with ups and downs
,The good and the bad things
,Living, loving, weeping and mourning
,Finally the circle's closing in
,The circle of life, another chance, another try
,The circle of life as moments passing by
,The circle of life, another love, another lie
,The circle of life, will we end in paradise?
,What will come and what will be, no one can foresee
,Future gives the answers to all questions
,Some may choose a simple life, some decide to die
,Some are always searching for the reasons
,Living, loving, weeping and mourning
,Finally the final curtain falls
,The circle of life, another chance, another try
,The circle of life as moments passing by
,The circle of life, another love, another lie
,The circle of life, will we end in paradise?
,Time to spread my wings and learn to fly
,Try to leave it all behind
,Time to enter up the stage of life
,The whole world is mine
,I will take the train to anywhere
,Go through Heaven and through Hell
,I will make my way and I don't care
,If I win or fail
,In the circle of life, another chance, another try
,On the way to paradise, another love, another lie
,i crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
,to search for the third key to open the gates
,now i'm near the altar the secret inside
,as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon's eyes
,on the way to the glory i'll honor my sword
,to serve right ideals and justice for all
,finally happened the sun fit their eyes
,the spell was creating strange games of light
,thanks to hidden mirrors i found my lost way
,over the stones i reached the place it was a secret cave
,in a long bloody battle that prophecies told
,the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
,for the king for the land for the mountains
,for the green valleys where dragons fly
,for the glory the power to win the black lord
,i will search for the emerald sword
,only a warrior with a clear heart
,could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
,yes, i'm that warrior i followed my way
,led by the force of cosmic soul i can reach the sword
,on the way to the glory i'll honor my sword
,to serve right ideals and justice for all
,for the king for the land for the mountains
,for the green valleys where dragons fly
,for the glory the power to win the black lord

Master of disguise move unseen
Shadow on the night silent hunter
Appetite aroused by the smell of your fear
Driven by desire instinct and hunger
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
In your slow demise mercy denied
Bitter is the taste of your last breath
Choking on a bite from the apple of eden
Victim of my lies deceit and betrayal
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
Shed my skin steal your soul
Again and again from the birth of time
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
And I will survive while you die
I will survive while you die
Shed my skin steal your soul
Again and again from the birth of time
Steal your soul shed my skin
Over and over until the end of time
Look into the eyes of fate
Destiny you can't escape
Precious life that you now chase
Slips away as you're erased
Seasons come and seasons go
What will come you'll never know
Future is a mystery
For this lock there is no key
So you pray but 
I say it's too late
Running from the hands of doom
Crawling back into the womb
Look of horror on your face
Feeble human wasting space
Time has come to say goodbye
And a life lived in a lie
Your tomorrow is now gone
The devil incarnate lives on
So you pray but 
I say it's too late
Led to the slaughter by those who were there to protect
Nailed to the cross then put on display to dissect
Dignity stripped like flesh being ripped from the bone
Sentence, death by mongrels to which you are thrown
Here comes the pack, come to attack
Blood in their eyes, no compromise
Thrown to the wolves, left there to die
Hiding from shadows that chase by the light of the moon
Choking on lies overflowing in silver spoons
Told of the cities of gold and a thousand delights
Fed to the dogs that hunt in the dead of the night
Here comes the pack, come to attack
Blood in their eyes, no compromise
Thrown to the wolves, left there to die
Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
As the brother shall deliver up the brother to death
Beg for a life that is worth not a dime to their kind
Pleading for mercy from those that would leave you behind
Betrayed with a kiss by the blackened soul you will save
Burned at the stake so the jackals can piss on your grave
Here comes the pack, come to attack
Blood in their eyes, no compromise
Thrown to the wolves, left there to die

I'm a man on a mission
And my deligence won't wait
There are supersonic killers in the sky
Everything you do will analized,
They control every step of your life
Well, mankind has gone to a high extreme
To the dark side on the way
All I see a masquerade
And the termination waits
Oh, I've seen the faces of million leaving here
Abandoned time and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing near
The mistery of fear is just about to clear
What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again
So we travel on at speed of light
And the gods will light our way
Gotta change our part in the masterplan
For another break in the race
And the trumpet sound will soon be heard
As the dead in mind awake
And the joyfull saints will guide us
On the onward flight that we take
Oh, I've seen a million
Leaving right away from here
Abandoned times and places of a world
Built out of fear
The quest is drawing near
The mystery of fear is just about to clear
What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again
Take make hand and you will see,
The mirror of your destiny
So many came to read the signs,
To understand their meaning
Now I see it's you and me,
So try to understand
And we will walk the road of life
Together hand in hand
I do not dare, I do not dare
But something's calling me
For those who dared could not break free
The one who will succeed,
I wonder, is it me?
Give us a chance to live,
Give us a chance to die,
Give us a chance to be free,
Without fire from sky
Give us a chance to love,
Give us a chance to hate
Give us a chance, before you kill us all
Before you kill us, kill us all
Before you kill us all, before you kill us all
Before you kill us all
What we need right now, is a miracle on earth
Let our hearts cry out, so our voices can be heard
Let us walk away together
From the never ending rain,
'Til the sun will shine for all of us again

,You showed me how to live for the first time in my life
,Nothing is forever as we change
,You came into my life and turned darkness into light
,With your divine fire set my heart ablaze
,Hope the only thing I keep in my heart
,Fear from losing you tears me apart
,I never felt this way as far as I remember
,There is no together, you turned away
,We left a trail of tears that washed away this love
,From this state of mourning I need to break free
,All of my dreams buried in the deep
,Shadows of you they are haunting me
,Hope the only thing I keep in my heart
,Fear from losing you tears me apart
,I will cherish what I learned from you
,Solace in mind helps me to get through
,Will I ever free myself from you
,Still I never turn my back on you
,Hope the only thing I keep in my heart
,Fear from losing you tears me apart
,I will cherish what I learned from you
,Solace in mind helps me to get through
,And I will never forget you

,Blind-folded and gagged, stood waiting
,With the whole world: my firing squad
,At the edge of the world I'm faced out
,Staring the sun right in the eye
,Vultures circle above, hyenas mocking the kill
,Excrement drooling down their chins
,Atop the cliffs I look down, into the starving Hell-mouth
,The rabid foam crashes hard on its teeth
,Their mouth's salivate
,Fantasizing my gruesome ending
,This world looks down upon
,A man who can stand on his own two feet
,As they're feeding their guns: "ready, aim"
,They say I'll live, if I die for their cause
,Living under the rule of fellow Cro-Magnon fool
,They fear who leads and will kill to stay still
,Their mouth's salivate
,Fantasizing my gruesome ending
,This world looks down upon
,A man who can stand on his own two feet
,Without eating from their claws
,Life feels quite like Hell should
,But this Hells so cold
,Pull another knife out
,Stick it with rest of them
,When my back is full

,Life feels quite like Hell should
,But this Hells so cold
,Pull another knife out
,Stick it with rest of them
,When my back is full

,As we melt, drowning inside their bloodied eyes
,Hope is ravaged, running from lacerations
,Sob so heavily, we choke, then we die
,Die...

The time is now to leave
For the place where my soul's to be
Ah, but let me out there
Where my heart "perisy ed kelsy"

I can't help walking along
The trace lies in a secret path
Let the freezing wind slash
In the blank leaving a mark me on

Beyond the border I wander where
Those spirits dance and glitter
Around my body and head
Washing all away my tears

Not the chance to see
When I take off my mask
The way I used to be
Make a change and make it all start

"Cej pe le temps alesis
Awk cyejm ko'd amet harh pesis
A, pesichi koę ci hejm
Kan ko'd henkchas 'perisy ed kelsy'"

Youngsters prostitute themselves
It's all part of the game
Wwalking up amd down the pavements
That bears both stars and names
Automatic fire
Sacred amendment guarantees
To kill or be killed is yuor own business
So fire as you please
Liberty & Justice
Crack the substitute for new highs
The hooker and the gunman
Barely more than a fucking child
And up the fucking hills
Silicon mummies by their pools
Sips their fucking drinks
And smile over their preserved youths
Liberty & Justice
I pledge allegiance in God we trust
Down the hood and up Wall Street
From the church and trough the school rooms
The decieve is but complete
Mr. Smith and family sits still
And pray over their fucking apple pie
And down the ghetto the law enforcement
Accidentally guns down another child
Liberty & Justice
作词 : Quorthon
I'm but a shell. 
A frame of a man. 
I'm but a glimpse of whom 
I used to be. 
I'm no more life and lust. 
I'm only rich on time to spend venting my own spleen. 
I'm sick as hell. 
I am in desperate need of heeling. 
Need to feel salvation. 
Or I might as well embrace death. 
I could never stand a world of sin and fornication. 
The world is full of whores. 
All this filth and heresy. 
I am a tool of the 
Lord. I have eternal life. 
The will of 
God was executed through my deeds. 
The voice of 
God I heard. 
All filth and unclean 
I disintegrated to prepare 
Gods paradise in this world. 
I read the holy writings. 
I read Matthew's 18th chapter, 7th, 8th and 9th. 
And I realised what had to be done. 
And that I just had so little time. 
The world is so full of sin. 
Blasphemy and sacrilege. 
For as I believe in him. 
I have eternal life after death. 
What have 
I done so wrong. 
Why have they put me in this place without no windows. 
I'm no more life and lust. 
I'm only rich on time to spend venting my own spleen. 
The world is so full of fools. 
Vagrant souls and lustful flesh. 
But as I believe in him. 
I have eternal life after death.
A sorcery written in blood
Whispered by a Witch in the dawn
Summon the darkness pure evil and death
And gather the legions of scorn
The darkness possesses you your soul scream in vain
Tonight the Hellfire shall burn
Thunder and lightning the ancient prediction
The bells chime for Satan's Return...
Blasphemy
Sorcery
It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of desire and pain
Sacrifice a virgin to the flames of burning Hell
Black Witch of beauty recite the words of spell
Gather masses run in circles scream for mercy cry of pain
No mercy for the blessed in Hell you all will burn in lord Satan's name
Now descend from the burning blasting sky
Holding the reigns ride the night
Satan appear in full glory and pride
The raped souls of Heaven cries
Blasphemy
Victory
Desecration
Hell and damnation
It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of desire and pain 

Burzum
Burzum
Ea, Lord Of The Deeps
The Head is a Head of a Serpent
From its Nostrils Mucus Trickles...
The Ears Are those of a Basilisk
His Horns Are Twisted into three Curls
The Body is a Sun Fish, Full of Stars
The Base of His Feet Are Claws
His Name Is Sassu Wunnu
A Sea Monster. A Form of Ea

作词 : Grishnackh
While we may believe
Our world - our reality
To be that is - is but one
Manifestation of the essence
Other planes lie beyond the reach
Of normal sense and common roads
But they are no less real
Than what we see or touch or feel
Denied by the blind church
Cause these are not the words of God
The same God that burnt the

,Glimpses of past too shallow to last
,These fragments too hollow to feel
,To hear, to feel, to sear
,Last drop, last untied knot
,Time to unleash all demons inside

,pulled under the raging waters, my child

 Like a pouring of the rain,
 Drowns my life
 Like this white walls
 I am trapped.
 
 ,
 I still can realize
 But why do they cease me to think?
 I have tried to write
 But they cut my fingers off.
 I still can think
 I see the symbols of world creation
 I have tried to speak
 But why do they cut off my tongue?
 
 ,
 Forever despair
 Forever solitude
 My guide - my pain
 Why do I still breathe?
 
 ,
 White walls, on your eyes I've left my nails
 Steel bars on window, how many teeth have I left for you?
 Gray floor, my prison gate, I hate you
 But you could not get my conscience away!
 I saw the numbers you consisted of
 I'd have told you to free me but my tongue...
 
 ,
 I still feel weaker
 I could open my mind, but society turned away
 I fear every one
 'Cause I see what they are consisted of.
 Now there's no way out
 Someday they'll kill my conscience
 But if I try to run
 They may cut my legs off...

,Fall into submission
,A turning point in life
,A fight against suppression
,To keep the dream alive
,As your heart is racing
,Sweat running down your face
,United in damnation
,Divided by our fate
,Never surrender
,Reach for the stars
,Marching on forever
,Through our darkest days
,The brighter the flame
,The deeper the shadows
,As the crowd is stomping
,Their masses crack the ground
,The sound of pure enjoyment
,This moment so profound
,Feel the darkness rising
,What you're seeing is what you get
,Fighting for the alliance
,The brotherhoods of fate
,Never surrender
,Reach for the stars
,Marching on forever
,Through our darkest days
,The brighter the flame
,The deeper the shadows
,Marching on forever
,Through our darkest days
,The brighter the flame
,The deeper the shadows
Morning bleeds me pale
Words feel so numb
I'm frozen in a place of time
I'm stuck to where I left
A modest wish has come true
A thought I never meant
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever
Turn your face towards the one that's deranged
Tell me the truth, I'm not here
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever
So jaded, I am here
And again, filled with grief
For a light that was so bright
The night sets forever
In my chamber of liquid dreams
The one I feel, the one I beseech
Hunt for life for a non-divine
The anguish leads to the world I entreat
Here we lie in silent breeze
In this vault it makes me feel
How my world is shred by grief
How this thing just should not be 

作曲 : Savolainen, Tuomela
I take a deep dive
Plunge into downward spiral
I am after virtue
Once again, after virtue still alive
Shades of existence
can't quench my thirst, my burning thirst
The Worst pain will never,
Ever vanish from this insane world
Will, power and pride
Kill my frailty inside
Silence futile words
Darken fearful eyes
I choose my side, yield myself to the beast
Or to immortality, nihil, vancancy
The world is declining, crumbling down to the ground
Wormwood delusions torment me in the end of the century
The world is declining, sinking low below the edge
Breeding offspring of lunacy in the end of the century
I tear apart the canvas
The final triumph of my creation
The ecstasy of decay
I am wriggling on the filthy floor
Trance of addiction
I must obey my muse, my frantic muse
They abuse my weakness
The make me shed my soul once more
Everything is losing away it's meaning here
Everything is fading away like you and me
Just burn out, just die down, slip off yourself
Fall of the West, fall of this unearned dignity

,As the candles yawned,
,My world grew darker
,'Til barely a detail remained
,Parchment and smoke
,Through distant chimes
,Moths carried by the breeze
,Her finger to my lips,
,I am stilled in an instant -
,I sip, and I'm numbed
,From here the path winds backwards
,At first I see my entering
,And then steps in reverse
,Descent where I had fallen
,Familiar, all is skewed
,And yet I cannot reflect
,Beyond my eyelids, I have died
,Days are merging quickly now,
,Into years that spiral from my chest
,They pass but leave no mark
,Familiar, all is skewed
,And yet I cannot reflect
,Beyond my eyelids, I have died
,yet I cannot reflect
,From here the path winds backwards
,Beyond my eyelids, I have died
,I swallow forgotten words
,To gain what was lost
,And lost what was gained
,Until neither is real
,Behind my head, her hands hold no weight
,I have reached a beginning,
,But somehow I do not stop
,I fall through the first moment
,To find that there is more

Our troops are ready to plunder and burn
Lightning strikes on command
Mark of death on the shining steel
We proudly hold the black banners high
Marching through the enemy's land
We sing the Devil's song
Always ready to lead and to die
We smile as the war reigns
And never kneel when the death is close
We proudly hold the black banners high
Marching through the enemy's land
We sing the Devil's song
Who else can trust so much the commanding Gods
To sacrifice life, soul and the world
Now war is lost, our tombs are cursed
Please, pray for us in Hell

,To put the sword in the fire
,My sleeping warrior
,ya ya ya .......
No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel, the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
AttackBullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near, no remorse
There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out, I feel like killing you
Let loose the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold
Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
Through the cracks, blood does leak
Distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me
Lifeless body, slouching dead Lecherous abscess
Where you once had a head
Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half
Crushing, cranial, contents
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions
Suffer, and then you die Torture, pulverized
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me
Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

Together with desolation
To fall deep in love with a bullet
In battle with your condition
A burden so condemned you revere it
So what is wrong with ordinary?
It's all you really need
But this obsession with oblivion
Is gonna take you down with me
Halo ,
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo ,
So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul
We lock the aftermath in a cage
Just to see how much you can take
I got a few questions for god
Like:
Tell me what is life?
Awaken me ,
Too long I've been trapped inside these walls
A recluse from the world
Damnation since the day I was born
Halo ,
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo ,
So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul
I won't go peacefully
Hand in hand through the promised land
Just to be double-crossed
I know you think I was out to get you
Steal your power, your creation
I spit it in your face
You are my enemy
And nothing you say can change
I won't apologize for the envy
I'll never stop being all that I can be
How low can you go?
Halo ,
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo ,
So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul

,Yeah
,
,Here we go again
,
,You got a killer sound there, said the devil
,So what did I say to him:
,"Yeah. You're right, bitch"
,And then we continued
,Now this one is for you
,Fuck yeah, it's on all the girls keep on dancing
,We're ready to give them everything
,
,There's no clarity, but I can feel the music
,
,I said before and I'll say it again:
,"We're nothing without all our demons"
,This kind of devil music is the yeah thing
,I said before and I'll say it again:
,We'll be here no matter what, my friend"
,We are everything you'll ever need,
,Just bite the hand that feeds
,Bring out your romance,
,Just sing for your halo
,Bring out your feelings
,And let all your love go
,Bring out your romance,
,Just sing for your halo
,Bring out your feelings

,Just laughed and walked away
,
,And the devil just laughed and walked away
,Just laughed and walked away
,Where the light is
,There is darkness
,Contradictions and all your temple
,
,This is feeling and I don't know how it gets that way,
,But it's on, it's on and you fucking love it
,And the devil just laughed and walked away

,Just sing for your halo
,Bring out your feelings
,And let all your love go
,Bring out your romance,
,Just sing for your halo

,从娘子唱到双截棍
,东风破到发如雪
,一路走来始终如一
,多样的曲风 独爱中国风
,我坚持风格
,我活在我的世界 谁都插不上嘴
,唱反调 是我的本性
,出奇不意是我的个性
,就算我站在山顶
,也只不过是个平民老百姓
,但我的肩膀 会有两块空地
,那就是勇气与毅力
,我要做音乐上的皇帝
,哼哼哈兮 哼哼哈兮
,哼哼哈兮 哼哼哈兮
,下坡的路 不费功夫
,别人已经帮你铺路
,但我选择上坡 因为我取名叫自负
,谦虚和那虚伪 就只差一个字
,有时有点分不清
,因为我喜欢真实的自己
,我不能够后退 因为不是绿叶
,如果只是点缀 愿当皎洁明月
,小草等待风吹 不用靠你的背
,假如天会很黑 我会请嫦娥奔月
,
,为什么写这首歌
,我现在还找不到动机
,不过用心听下去
,你会觉得更有意义
,如果你对未来产生恐惧
,眼前雾濛濛一片
,那是因为你没把眼镜给擦干净
,勇敢走下去 这首歌会陪你前进
,我常常在想宇宙只有一颗太阳
,为什么我的影子这么多 这么像
,战胜幻象 和我一样
,喜欢模仿的朋友们
,崇拜是件好事
,欣赏是种美德
,但走在我后面 我很担心
,别人会看不见你
,到最后只是一个接一个的分身
,这样的鼓励 是否太直接 太讽刺
,老师在讲 到底有没有在听啊
,我告诉你 做自己胜于跟太紧
,最大的敌人就是那内心的自己
,我不能够后退 因为不是绿叶
,如果只是点缀 愿当皎洁明月
,小草等待风吹 不用靠你的背
,假如天会很黑 我会请嫦娥奔月

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
I was raised in the hood called what the difference
The brothers in the hood we 
Chivalrous
So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin' it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up on my lap
It’s on your lips so trap shut
A steel dick more flick for pump butts
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is
In my civic or in this show biz 
I shoot the fool, kill the fool
Come on what you say?
I think I can take care of all you muthafuckas, don't delay right away
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?'
Cause tricks be out for your blindside
Never understood it, but remember 
I showed you
That in these times you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of for gettin' high
And a cop ain't good for shit but just passing you by
If ever in trouble on the double best to call your pals
And if you ain't got none bias talk
I gotta learn your styles around me
Are we getting along? 
Were family, we better be
We got your back we got your back kid
Just don’t be pointing one of them guns, all right man
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggaz shit
But they can’t be fucking with mine

,To save your life
,You like when it hurts?
,Let it burn!
,Let it burn!
,You ain't sure what came first
,Was it your flame or thirst?
,You need to please them both
,To put you out
,Another wasted youth
,You thought you'd seen the truth
,You need to find a voice
,To help you shout
,I like when it hurts!

Bang the bass, turn up the treble

Microphone that I am holdin'
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen

To try to save them your voice will sink
So please, stay off my back

Shredding skim with the lyrics rhyme breaking the bone
Through your soul with the tone of my microphone

And take your time you bring us all nose jive

,Born a believer, I walk alone
,Can′t find a place where I feel at home
,Well I′m crazy, but I am sane
,I′m guilty, but not to blame
,This is my nature, who I am
,If you don′t like it, here I stand
,I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Shove it in my mouth
,I can't control my evil
,I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Have a bigger bite
,I love you baby, though I hate you
,I'm a double nature!
,Now a heretic, I have become
,I've lost my faith in God and man
,I am a demon, free from sin
,But there′s no angel who lets me in
,My wheels are rolling, they′re rolling fast
,Straight outta Hell, away from my past
,I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Shove it in my mouth
,I can't control my evil
,I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Have a bigger bite
,I love you baby, though I hate you
,I'm a double nature!
,Now here′s a warning, some final words
,Turn me down, and you′ll burn, burn...
,I am awakened, I never sleep
,My eyes are bleeding, I′m a freak
,I′m short of patience, don′t mean no harm
,I′m just a guy with a burning heart
,I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Shove it in my mouth
,I can't control my evil
,I, I wanna keep it, though I eat it
,Have a bigger bite
,I love you baby, now I hate you
,I'm a double nature!

,You pushed it to the limit
,Now you gotta choose tonight
,Tarot woman,
,you're all about to loose the fight
,Don't need a part time wizard
,Who drives me outta my mind
,Cuz I'm allright
,I gonna live it up tonight
,Once upon a time,
,Trought the world was mine alone
,Had no time to realize,
,It came without a warning at all
,Like a fist in your face
,A fist in your face
,And there's a time bomb ticking
,Deep inside my head
,Must be a black hole attraction
,A wrong step n' your dead
,Don't know the words surrender
,Don't know the rules of the game
,I'm ready to go and I swear
,You won't forget my name
,Once upon a time,
,Trought the world was mine alone
,Had no time to realize,
,It came without a warning at all
,Like a fist in your face
,A fist in your face
,
,
,So you're telling me now all your friends call you honey
,There's your name on the wall and it ain't that funny
,Guess you're out on the street shakin' legs every night
,And the whole world's looking at you kinda love at first bite
,And the same old song I hear you play on and on again
,You gotta make my day
,Yeah, you drank all my wine n' you gave all my money away
,No more gas In the car and your dog wants me to stay
,Woo darling you know you go a little too far
,But I'm sure not a pawn on your chessboard baby no more
,And the same old song I hear you play on and on again
,You gotta make my day
,You gotta make my day woo
,Solo
,You got the same old song I hear you play on and on again
,You gotta make my day
,Make it now
,Woo you gotta make my day
,Well, you take It all for granted you got me hypnotised
,So who do you think you are, honey
,Want you to make my day
,Make it now awo come on come on
,Make my day
,It's a human sign
,When things go wrong
,When the scent of her lingers
,And temptation's strong
,Into the boundary
,Of each married man
,Sweet deceit comes calling
,And negativity lands
,Cold cold heart
,Hard done by you
,Some things look better baby
,Just passing through
,And it's no sacrifice
,Just a simple word
,It's two hearts living
,In two separate worlds
,But it's no sacrifice
,No sacrifice
,It's no sacrifice at all
,Mutual misunderstanding
,After the fact
,Sensitivity builds a prison
,In the final act
,We lose direction
,No stone unturned
,No tears to damn you
,When jealousy burns
,Cold cold heart
,Hard done by you
,Somethings look better baby
,Just passing through
,And it's no sacrifice
,Just a simple word
,It's two hearts living
,In two separate worlds
,But it's no sacrifice
,No sacrifice
,It's no sacrifice at all
,Cold cold heart
,Hard done by you
,Some things look better baby
,Just passing through
,And it's no sacrifice
,Just a simple word
,It's two hearts living
,In two separate worlds
,But it's no sacrifice
,No sacrifice
,It's no sacrifice at all
,It's no sacrifice at all
,It's no sacrifice at all

,I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
,Hold parties in our sleep

,I can't hide it
,I can't erase it
,Have to believe it
,A place where I can't find it
,Throw it up if you with me

, party...ok,party people in da house (scratch by Robaholic)
, let's get the party started (talkbox by Robaholic)
,Verse 1 Zinco泥鳅
,城市像个大烟囱费力地吞云吐雾
,我载上我的homie 对他说 我们还不如
,不如开车上路 我带路 最迷人的club就在下条街的转角处
,身着白衣的天使渐渐地睡去 像我在那个夜晚没有丝毫醉意
,假装着毫不费力 掩盖身体的退避
,在一个小小的黑洞里独吞她的魅力
,她的无视就像对我开了枪 uh
,我的homie嘴巴就像开了光 uh
,在我搞不懂她为什么要在装
,她却回眸一瞥对我开了窗
,这给了我短暂 观察她的余地
,也让我幻想出她说情话的语气
,她柔软的肩膀 和她锋利的鼻梁
,她的嘴唇是我最想吃的槟郎
,像着了魔 像着了火
,在这灯火通明都市的colorful
,不要斟酌 都很寂寞
,在这万里挑一的夜晚吃了我
,Verse 2 Zinco泥鳅
,我说no no 我开了车
,她说no no 放开了喝
,接下来还有更好玩的事情在等着 就像引擎混合在喷射
,走到哪里你都跟着
,pretty girl我没有那么深刻
,在你面前不会闷着
,天亮之前我认真的
,掀起衣摆 我的女孩 你知道我有哪些期待
,像只小猫步子很小 欲擒故纵的你又躲起来
,行行好 拜托拜托
,想要的 太多太多
,一句话来概括概括 彼此身体不要怠惰怠惰
,像着了魔 像着了火
,在这灯火通明都市的colorful
,不要斟酌 都很寂寞
,在这万里挑一的夜晚吃了我
,Verse 3 大笑
,okay~
,这个灯光我特别想犯罪
,记不清第几次的派对
,你的眼神里有团火焰
,我们的距离只隔着一张纸片
,把手机都丢在一旁 暧昧逐渐进场 一点小小的紧张
,你是我的可以这么说吗？
,偷心的手段忍不住彼此捉弄着
,蒙住了眼睛 给你个惊喜
,天亮了之后 关系都清理
,今晚的星星 唱着爵士歌曲
,围绕在耳边 更像是调味剂
,一步两步 我跟在你的身后
,噪音的舞池 我听心动的demo
,我们对话像battle
,从来没有遇过高手直到你吻我在街口
,像着了魔 像着了火
,在这灯火通明都市的colorful
,不要斟酌 都很寂寞
,在这万里挑一的夜晚吃了我
,像着了魔 像着了火
,在这灯火通明都市的colorful
,不要斟酌 都很寂寞
,hey girl
,you know I just wanna...
,在这万里挑一的夜晚吃了我
,I just wanna...

言语的表达不足以体现彼此的重要
你我他各抒着己见更像情感的通道
我没有那么多的童话故事可以写进歌
每一段感情都不容易 总有你心动的
人就是简单又复杂的动物
不小心就戳到了痛处
非你不可到陌生人又开始结束习惯了痛苦
那不是你
自己都不自己
不敢靠得太近 只怕自己爱上你
也许我会更加努力把赚的钱塞满衣柜
而不是在你耳边抱怨生活不给机会
感谢你的出现 让我生命长出新鲜的果
也要感谢老爸追到老妈 才有今天的我
你像我夜里写歌时候手里燃的烟
你像我身后那片充斥着蔚蓝的天
你像我低谷时候开的另外一道门
你像我红色本子上的另外一个人

Hook
略

诶 不再管黑幕 Yep 决定了身边的她
诶 你像是归宿也像是我见过的最美的春天的花
诶 被你给瞄准 Yep 差点就击穿心脏
诶 你是白天的太阳夜里指引我前进的西方星象
Wow You like COCO 天边的彩虹桥
我怎么舍得收手比自己还重要 
直到我学会珍惜刚好能够把你碰到
答应你Pretty Baby 拒绝所有投怀送抱
不会有问题 "问题都消失了吗？"
开出的花已填满了前路 带着你到终点圆满的结束
爬到了最高的山顶看最美的鱼雁
把你没听过的情话通通都说一遍
有你在的日子里每一天都晴朗
you are my Beautiful Lady 哪怕生活平淡
带着你欣赏 跨越最美的河 
风雨让我挡 照顾你Sweet Girl

Hook
略

难以忘记
初次见你 
迷人眼睛
在我脑海里 你的身影
挥散不去
透不过气
我想珍惜
看到你受委屈我会伤心
只怕我 只怕我
只怕我自己会爱上你

,我的钞票你别要终于找到了解药不好意思那就先到这
,我才不要做你的共同好友
,你也别假惺惺地求我不要走
,我不做你的狗 也不牵你的手
,只做个你最忘不了的前男友
,祝你有最烂的心情 和每天喝的酒应景
,脱了手算老子命硬 庆幸 ***你应该要醒醒
,现在过了晚上12点钟 你又在哪个酒吧里脸红
,喝多别怕 死鱼了别怕 就等着艾滋病把你选中

,当三藏掉落悬崖
,站在灵鹿上的陛下
,这一次的见面注定要经历太多的挣扎
,你是要西行
,还是要儿女私情
,是只爱她吗
,还是你要一直爱着众生
,可是这个问题很深
,或许已经动了凡心
,其实自己也没有发现自己会有六欲七情
,从苦海无涯到披不上的袈裟
,后知后觉的才发现自己原来也会想她
,舍我的王权富贵
,这情谊落地，双行的经书字迹
,陪你守戒律清规
,忘情到不知所以，可以陪你写到万里
,一眼万年终沉醉
,从见面的那一刻起，彷佛有了存在的意义
,任国凋零与君归
,想和你远走高飞，甚至可以牺牲自己
,抹不去众生慈悲
,命中注定的错过若能重新来过
,逃不过缘起成泪
,眼中的手足无错化作泪水滴落
,苦海无涯几人回
,谁能把红尘看破得到真正的快乐
,许卿来世再相随
,如果有来生，我一定还给你承诺
,舍我的王权富贵
,陪你守戒律清规
,一眼万年终沉醉
,任国凋零与君归

,或许自己的心情 不再删除那记忆
,看不见你的时候 勉强的我好累
,从第一眼见到你的时候 就感觉很对
,那么也请你 给我一次机会
,不要让我每天带着安慰入睡
,你爱生闷气 却很少发飙
,可爱的时候会嘟着嘴对我撒娇
,我试着提过你穿起婚纱的样貌
,你总说不敢去想 说你还太小
,习惯了世界里只有你能影响我
,习惯了生活里只有你能陪伴我
,习惯了每天早上当你的闹钟
,习惯了你 说你离不开我
,你喜欢唱歌吗 我从前问过你
,觉得我神经吗 我也在问自己
,我只是害怕 时间让我错过你
,怕来不及抓着你 就让别人得到你
,没来得及准备 偷偷关注你的消息
,不知道为什么 我变的很消极
,或许在某一天 你能碰巧听到这首歌
,希望那时候 我也能够把你抓着

,总觉得古怪 为什么 爸妈分开睡
,幸福里的孩子而且玩 具一大堆
,还记得一年级考试我拿了一 百分
,还记得一年级唯一的一百 分
,那时我抱着妈妈抱着我旋 转
,总觉得生 活 应该这样的圆满
,那时每 晚抱着她 才能入睡
,那时每 晚她讲故事让我入睡
,像一阵细雨 洒落我心底
,那感觉如此 神秘
,我不禁抬起头看 着你
,而你 并不露痕迹
,一个阳 光的下午 醒来被一切吓住
,快放 完的煤气罐和紧 闭的窗户
,那个女人用她温 暖的双手
,抓紧我的咽喉忽 略我的咳嗽
,再加上煤气中毒肿 胀的舌头
,那种味道 现在依然让我难受
,这故事从开头 也许是一种 错
,错人错配偶错婚 错有我
,大概两小时 从模 糊中醒来
,滴下的血花都握不断往下摔
,刀片划 开了她的手腕和颈部动脉我
,跑下楼道 叫她男人回 来
,还记得那时父亲往家跑的模 样
,嚎 啕的嗓 音像野 兽在呼唤
,混 乱的脚步到了主 人的房 到了主 人的床
,捂着咽 喉的器官
,像一阵细雨 洒落我心底
,那感觉如此神 秘
,我不禁抬起头看 着你
,而你 并不露痕迹
,抢救了一天一 夜换来病 危的通知
,花掉很多存款这个 就叫做城市
,满是血的父亲站在走 廊
,还算年 轻的脸庞却已布 满了沧桑
,过了几天 妈安静地离去
,虽然她本来是应该带 上我一 起
,还没死掉的我 这是悲剧还是奇 迹
,还没死掉的我 让我中毒的不是煤气
,那时密集的空吊信是来自她的娘家
,那时候我才明白人们 有多么可怕
,那时候开 始我不再 是谁的外孙
,那时候开 始我把他 们当做坏人
,谁说没妈的孩子就是一 根 草
,无数的情感里面同情 我最不需要
,but that's ok 最坏 的已经过 去
,but that's ok 最坏 的已经过 去
,像一阵细雨 洒落我心底
,那感觉如此 神秘
,我不禁抬起头看 着你
,而你 并不露痕迹

If there's a problem then go and fix it
It's such a simple phrase but I can't grasp it
I lay awake at night
With the fear of dying if I close my eyes
What's the point of existence
With this incurable sickness
Just show me the door
Give me a place to rest
What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head
I may never know
Just how deep the rabbit hole goes
Medication won't solve it
But I guess it's a solution till I find the true culprit
What's the point of existence
With this incurable sickness
Just show me the door
Give me a place to rest
What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head
What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming, it's just me
What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head

RainI can feel the rain,
Just cold, boring autumn rain
Falling on my face, and my hands, my words, my tears
Damn rain is taking my confidence,
And breaking my will.
So now I'm blind and deafand coldweak
Standing in the rain
You can stop this rain that's falling,
You can wake the sun that's moaning
You can make me dead for loving,
You can but you won't
I'll stand right there in the rain, cold rain
I'll stand in front of you, in front of them, in front of hatred
Until it stops
Until the clusters of clouds disappear
And leave me alone

,for ten long years he'll count the days.
,Over the mountains and the seas,
,a prisoner's life for him there'll be.
,He knew that it would cost him dear,
,but yet he dare not say.
,Where he had been that fateful night,
,a secret it must stay.
,He had to fight back tears of rage.
,His heart beat like a drum.
,For with the wife of his best friend,
,he spent his final night of freedom.
,Over the hills and far away,
,he swears he will return one day.
,Far from the mountains and the seas,
,back in her arms he swears he'll be.
,Over the hills and far away.
,Over the hills and,
,over the hills and,
,over the hills and far away.
,Each night within his prison cell,
,he looks out through the bars.
,He reads the letters that she wrote.
,One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
,Over the hills and far away,
,she prays he will return one day.
,As sure as the rivers reach the seas,
,back in his arms he swears she'll be.
,Over the hills and far away,
,he swears he will return one day.
,Far from the mountains and the seas,

,Summer is gone a while ago
,The daylight dims away
,I"m watching here how the snow begins to fall
,Yesterday is like a dream
,A memory in my head
,Like the life"s gone behind the winter wall
,
,I"m lighting up the candles and lock the door
,Sitting by the fire
,It"s time to dream some more
,I have to find a way how to survive
,I am surrounded by the starlight
,I have to find the path out to escape
,from the Cold Winter Nights
,Winter Nights
,
,And in the morning there"s no trace of the sun
,Just gray fog hanging above my head
,All the birds are quiet hiding in the woods
,Can"t see no movement are they all dead?

,I stand alone in the dark- ness
,The winter of my life came so fast
,Memories go back to child- hood
,To days I still recall
,Oh how happy I was then
,There was no sorrow there was no pain
,Walking through the green fields
,Sunshine in my eyes
,I'm still there everywhere
,I'm the dust in the wind
,I'm the star in the northern sky
,I never stayed anywhere
,I'm the wind in the trees
,Would you wait for me forever ?

,And told great tales of the huntmasters' deeds
,The quest for a drum of the famous ol' spiced
,Has shown us the wrath of leviathans might

,Though we end up shipwrecked having no fun
,But heavy metal pirates we must be

,I'm just a loser in the game of love
,I'm just a stray boy in the shade
,And how I Wish to know what love is like
,To find someone to contemplate
,There's a voice and a million answers
,To the questions I don't ask a demon-I've got to contain
,When I'm walking through the fen
,Gonna deep into the black
,There are whispers that I can't restrain
,Don't give in
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,So you're an angel meant to walk down here
,And you believe it's all divine
,And you don't play by all those temporal rules
,Watch the world begin to die
,Alright-when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
,I've been crashing from the sky
,Fallen to care for the pray
,They put a spoke right in your wheel
,I'm the one to dare the weak
,To push you all over the pain
,You give in
,Oh...
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
,He's got treasure in his eyes that he gonna turn to clay
,Hm,I'm a stranger
,I'm a changer and I'm a danger
,Maybe...
,Fallen angel-waiting for the prey
,The devil has come to take a mainmed away
,Penetration of the twisted mind
,The evil is out for the weak and blind
,I can feel it in your voice
,Ever so sweet
,No
,Do I really have a choice?
,No,no,no!
,Oh,you burn your feet n unholy ground
,You roam the barren wicked plains abound
,In evil eyes and evil speak
,About it all your evil freaks
,When you say it's all divine and meant to be
,What about your flesh and blood and defire like me?
,Their evil eyes are looking down on you
,And those who don't are losing sight of you
,Face the rage to chase away
,The specter of disgrace and shame
,Withered roses dying on the ledge
,A withered dreamer standing on the edge
,You dream of love but you wake up to pain
,You're better off to join in my game
,Then she'll better off to cry contrite tears
,One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
,Rise to fame
,(your time has come)
,Time will come
,(to take the sun)
,Make your claim-you're drawn to the sound
,Time has come-you're leaving ground
,Rise to fame-the flight of the crow
,Time will come-cross the line
,Your time has come
,For the crow to fly away
,It's a flight to hell
,Can you hear the bell
,The devil has come
,To take your soul away
,A flight to hell
,Alright
,I'm a stranger
,I'm a changer
,And I'm danger
,Fallen angel
,Waiting for the prey
,
,I'm smothered by your lucid nothing
,I can't hear and touch and see
,But I feel it
,Though I can't believe it
,Like master of the observation
,Coming up with an explanation
,There's no need
,Making use of the spirit
,We can give you answers you are dying to receive
,Keep on dreaming
,Keep on screaming
,yeah
,You might be getting too much for your beating hart to take
,Your flesh is malice
,Prepare your chalice
,Lights
,breathe and sleep tight
,Will you defy intriguing ghostlights
,Seeing through all lies and foolish warnings
,There ain't no return
,Never like the darkness
,It may burn your soul away
,As you've been seeing
,What you've though you're dreaming
,Never open doors if you don't dare to walk on through
,Maybe you're old
,Now it's all your fault
,Light
,You're off to the light
,Will you defy all evil ghostlights
,Tell the truth from depuration
,Time
,Don't waste no time
,Prevail against the hands that tick your flesh away
,Now delve into your own reflection
,Ohhh in all that where I've been to
,There's nothing but a void
,Over the sanity of fools
,Shine your light into the darkness
,And let the storm descend upon you
,And I will make you mine
,Shine your light into the darkness
,Behold the lead aurora fall upon you
,Oh, Let the storm descend upon you
,
,Journey to the other side
,It's just a trip and pleasure ride
,And I don't know
,But does it really matter
,I am he who's always been
,Who dares to know what can't be seen
,I'm illusion or truth
,I'm confusion
,Light
,Bring me the light
,I will bring out certainty on a silver plate
,Like a mantle piece
,I will wipe out darkness
,Light
,Blessed is the lie
,Till there's no time left to spill
,To save and kill
,To take and seize
,Till this trip's your law
,Obey reflections of some crazy dream
,Or maybe the backside of reality
,Shine your light into the darkness
,And let the storm descend upon you
,And I will make you mine
,Shine your light into the darkness
,Behold the lead aurora fall upon you
,Let the storm descend upon you
,
,You gotta pray you're gunning just a ghostlight
,You gotta be won't be falling down the wayside
,Let it carry you away
,Cut the gem until it's purified away
,The candle burning to the ground
,I don't see nothing but addiction to the rhyme
,Kindles everything around
,For all the world we'll see it tower to the stars
,And all is melting into one
,We give them something to fall back on everytime
,They're too strung out to run
,Every moment, every heartbeat, every breath
,Leaves you one less to your last
,Still you cherish every second of the game
,Give me the future, you take the past
,And what if God is just an image in the mind
,A reflection of the will
,And what's the valor when the law you live in harmony
,Falls second for the drill
,I pray the lord ain't just a ghostlight in my mind
,a reflection of the will
,Let the storm descend upon me
,Let aurora fall upon me
,Let the fire fall upon him
,Let the fire purify him
,Never judge a thing you see
,It's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be
,Ohhh bring it on
,Let the dark and heaven confusion
,Spit out a conclusion
,
,Obey reflections of a memory
,Are just reflections in a crazy dream
,Shine your light into the darkness
,And let the storm descend upon you
,And I will make you mine
,Shine your light into the darkness
,Behold the lead aurora fall upon you
,Shine your light into the darkness (through the darkness)
,And let the storm descend upon you
,And I will make you mine
,Shine your light into the darkness (into the darkness)
,Behold the lead aurora fall upon you
,Oh, Let the storm descend upon you (let the storm descend upon you)
,Ohhh descend upon you, yeah.

走過這條路，結局早已註定
天秤因冷酷無情而失衡
征服的天性是沉重的枷鎖
阮自出生就已背負此罪

Assemble! Onward! Invade! It’s the only path
藉著惡毒心機，阮將摧毀一切

Assemble! Onward! Invade! It’s the only path
掌握戰局，散佈驚惶，支配這一切

阮將摧毀一切
支配這一切

染血的結局早已被寫下

僅存一口氣
世界瓦解成灰
萬物消亡
你我只有毀滅一途

輪迴侵蝕
悲劇反覆重演
無法避免
這是阮丌命運

can’t solve my question
you are looking like

Moral law! The drinker's guide
Was handed down by god
Sacred law for man to follow
Revere them as your own

can’t solve my question
you are looking like

, 过去那种感觉不再有 珍惜这拥有
, 不知道到哪儿才是尽头 我该怎么走
,
, 昨夜我又梦见那束光芒 它仍在我的上空嘲笑
, 嘲笑着我悲哀的沧桑 可怜着我无奈的被迫
, 它说你要保持着沉默 因为你的环境很险恶
, 还要永远保持着低调 不要忘记脸上要带着微笑
, 过去那种感觉不再有 珍惜这拥有
, 不知道到哪儿才是尽头 我该怎么走
,
, 妈妈 给我一瓶酒吧 因为我病的不只是身体
, 我想睡在星空的下面 幻想自己能够居住无人的天体
, 我很怀念“草”带来的快乐 因为现在真的没有什么值得快乐
, 舞台变得也只是个理由 要面对的还是残酷的生活
, 过去那种感觉不再有 珍惜这拥有
, 不知道到哪儿才是尽头 我该怎么走
,
, 此时又是一个致命的夜的清醒 在灰蓝色的夜空向寂寞侵袭
, 而我犹如一只无知的小狗 在静静的等待着你的决定
, 我知道我就是一粒尘土 在人世间不停的漂漂荡荡
, 也许某天我会飞回你的身边 也许永远的被你遗忘
, 对于现在我已没有什么好说的 就让沉默来折磨我仅有的快乐
, 遭遇正在发生的背叛和欺骗 我还需要满足谁的欲望呢
, 在这苍凉的夜幕之下 多想有双手臂来温暖我早已僵硬的身躯
, 也许我会在感动之中苏醒 也许永远的在幸福中死去
, 我爱你们 所有爱我的人 因为我正在学着接受生活
, 放弃这么多年我已经够了 现在开始真的感到绝望了
, 亲爱的 你现在听得到吗 我有句话想在这对你说
, “还是找个好男人结婚吧” 我会每天都为你祝福的

,Where am I, where I go?
,Maybe roam to a place that would only exist in my own dreams
,Into the nowhere where all yearnings end and my life then would be real
,The journey’s eternal
,I’m riding and diving,
,ascending to skies that are yet unseen
,The quest is a long one to find me a place where no one has ever been
,Before me lies freedom, waiting for me
,I am on this way now that I used to be for so long
,I will never come back here to this place that I once called home

,It starts with one thing
,I don't know why
,It doesn't even matter
,How hard you try
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme
,To explain in due time
,All I know
,Time is a valuable thing
,Watch it fly by
,As the pendulum swings
,Watch it count down
,To the end of the day
,The clock ticks life away
,It's so unreal
,Didn't look out below
,Watch the time go
,Right out the window
,Trying to hold on,
,But didn't even know
,Wasted it all just
,To watch you go
,I kept everything inside and
,Even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,One thing,
,I don't know why
,It doesn’t even matter
,How hard you try,
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme,
,To remind myself how
,I tried so hard
,In spite of the way
,You were mocking me
,Acting like I was
,Part of your property
,Remembering all the
,Times you fought with me
,I'm surprised it got so (far)
,Things aren't the way
,They were before
,You wouldn't even
,Recognise me anymore
,Not that you
,Knew me back then
,But it all comes
,Back to me (in the end)
,You kept everything inside
,And even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when I
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I've put my trust in you
,Pushed as far as I can go
,For all this
,There's only one thing you should know
,I've put my trust in you
,Pushed as far as I can go
,For all this
,There's only one thing you should know
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
,Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,A lightening bolt fills the room,
,The underbelly of Paris,

,She'll drink you under the table,
,She'll show you a trick or two,
,But every time that I left her,
,I missed the things she would do.
,
,She was the one - for me,
,She opened my eyes - to see,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.
,
,It was a cold September,
,Before the Indian summer,
,That's the thing I remember,
,When she gave me her number,
,Went from station to station,
,On a train 'cross the nation
,And the rain of November,
,That's the time that we ended,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.

,Cocaine tucked in her shoes,
,Cigarettes over coffee,
,Her halo slipped to a noose,
,Take a slow boat to China,
,You fly a rag 'round the moon,

,I knew it had to end soon.

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, 
blown on the steel breeze. 
Come on you target for faraway laughter, 
come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr,and shine! 

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, 
rode on the steel breeze. 
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, 
come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine! 

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. 
Shine on you crazy diamond. 
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, 
and sail on the steel breeze. 
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, 
come on you miner for truth and delusion,and shine!

,Hello.
,Is there anybody in there?
,Just nod if you can hear me.
,Is there anyone at home?
,Come on, now.
,I hear you're feeling down.
,Well I can ease your pain,
,Get you on your feet again.
,Relax.
,I need some information first.
,Just the basic facts
,Can you show me where it hurts?
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I had a fever.
,My hands felt just like two balloons.
,Now I got that feeling once again.
,I can't explain, you would not understand.
,This is not how I am.
,I have become comfortably numb.

,Ok.
,Just a little pinprick.
,There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
,But you may feel a little sick.
,Can you stand up?
,I do believe it's working. Good.
,That'll keep you going for the show.
,Come on it's time to go.
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
,Out of the corner of my eye.
,I turned to look but it was gone.
,I cannot put my finger on it now.
,The child is grown, the dream is gone.
,I have become comfortably numb.

our future is now, our world is ending 
our life for the disdain has brought about our end time 
… It’s our time 
for those who would fail to see a future uncertainty, end time is certainly 
bring in you lost and pray, our world’s catastrophe, 
bring in the lost to stay 
The end time is our time - Our time is the end time 
No matter what our self destruction 
a condition of memory suppressing past transgressions 
bring on our annihilation in our world in chaos collapses 
it never fails to amaze me how quickly we forget 
watch our world in chaos collapse 
our time 
our time here on planet earth 
cradle obliveon 
fall asleep 
in arms of obliveon

I know -- the policies of war
I know -- the ruthless sacrifice
I know -- that broken toys explode
You know -- I'll never compromise
Born into -- smashing divisions
Religious conviction in lime
Moral repression depression
Our cattle are starting to drive
Your reason for breaking the heart and your mind
Usurp the beliefs of last few who cry
Fucking tourist start your drive to mundane existence
This lifer could give a fuck
If you had your own opinion

Ignorance and prejudice.
Raping peoples minds.
Molded by environment.
Hatred of all kinds.
Never knowing tolerance.
The ignorent domain.
Never knowing freedom.
Wear it like a chain.

A life of hate is useless.
You don't have a cause.
Breeding hate with no excuse.
Starting racial wars.
Religion teaching lies.
Hypnosis of the weak.
Believing false prophets.
Slaughtering the meek.

Innocent victim.
Murdered by your lies.
All the hate that you create.
A product of stupidity.
All the statements you have made.
Have no real validity. 

About your policies
Well i wonder
Its crisis overload
And no wonder
Falling, we're falling, falling
Down this fucking hole
Begin the slaughter and
Welcome pigs
Slop the bullshit, welcome in
Insert the blade,

Twist the fucking blade,
Bloodlust... kill all politicians

,好像是过了很久你都不说话
,又想起她围巾还放在你的家
,淅沥沥哗啦啦什么 在 不停下
,又想起她哭起来应该是这样吧
,好像是走了很远你都不害怕
,害怕夜晚像猛兽会把你吃了吧
,时而沉重又时而地浮夸
,时而地要杀死这样的自己吧
,时而沉重又时而地浮夸
,时而地要杀死这样的自己吧
,请把她放在你昨日没做完的梦里吧
,来不及翻到下一页看那少年的伟大
,既然要做奴隶吃谁的粮食听谁的话
,你就别在睡梦中说动人的情话
,能够让你死去的东西全都扔了吧
,你都没有一个合适的理由去爱妈妈
,既然来 不及看完一朵绽放的鲜花
,那就带上它的遗 像去超凡世界吧
从毛细血管壁的间隙中渗出
来到感染发炎的患处
变形运动游走缓缓伸出伪足
将那病原体团团围住

时常你会主动地，推荐给我一些歌，
每首我都会仔细听，有时觉得还不错，
有时真的觉得普普通通，相信你也会一样，
在我那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
但有那么一瞬间，我们两人同步了。
每首对的音乐响起，雀跃了四周颜色，
我们不知不觉翩翩起舞，在彼此的心里面，
在你那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
天各一边，同时按下播放键，
对齐时间，旋律穿针又引线。
天各一边，同时按下播放键，
对齐时间，旋律穿针又引线。
时常你会配合地，接住我的一些梗，
无论包袱内容好坏，无论是什么场合。
有时真的觉得心灵相通，相信你也会一样，
在我那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
语言的礼让互动，我们两人同步了。
灵魂交织天衣无缝，精神上水乳交融，
这是更深入的干柴烈火，在彼此的心里面，
在你那些一厢情愿的，精挑细选的，心驰神往的回赠时刻。
越发熟练，旁人不懂你的甜，
合并空间，字句风花又雪月。

Access into the deep, to meet the anglerfish.
Vampire of the abyss, and a black devil.
Even with outer space as a final frontier,
Mysteries remain here on earth.
If you meet these creatures face to face.
Now you see they are all aliens.
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Thousands of meters from the water’s surface.
Submerge into the dark, beneath the crushing pressure.
Sparkling ocean floor, inside an endless silence
Even with outer space as a final frontier,
Mysterious remain here on earth.
If you meet these creatures face to face.
Now you see they are all aliens.
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Dive dive into eternal night
Thousands of meters from the water’s surface.
她从来不与人交换眼神，仿佛从未落入凡尘，
在下一个转角是否,有故事发生呢？
一切都以美感作为标准，自己就是艺术本身，
观影过程如此神圣，没人敢再出声。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。
雷同的剧情, 无法酣畅淋漓，
对不起，对不起，对不起，对不起。
又在同一幕布景里醉了，同一句台词处哭了。
真人或者角色究竟,谁才是扁平的？
她只能不厌其烦地重温，假装每次都是新的，
定格在了最后一帧，心却还在扑通着。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。
矛盾的语境，无法不言自明，
对不起，对不起，对不起，对不起。
抱歉我的真情流露,比不上电影桥段。
No there’s no time to stop
You’d best not be caught sleeping
No mercy from the clock
Surviving on caffeine drip
Promised so much you see
Time now to pay up
But if you’re not early
Well then you’re not timely
Promised so much you see
Time now to pay up
Oh no....
Profits need you
Cause we’re almost out of time
All the slaves on assembly line
Profits need you
Oh, look out for that deadline
And don’t stop we’re running behind
Must see it through
Must see this through
Must execute
Too much to do
Get done see it through 
Live PDQ
Die PDQ
Must work, pursue
Endless pursuit
Ceaseless pursuit 
Carry it through
Profits need you
Profits need you
Profits need you
Oh, look out for that deadline
All the slaves on assembly line
Your lunch belongs to us
Now you’re too tired to listen
Man hurry, hurry up
The entire board is waiting
Promised so much you see
Time now to pay up
But if you’re not early
Well then you’re not timely
Promised so much you see
Time now to pay up
Oh no....
Profits need you
Cause we’re almost out of time
All the slaves on assembly line
Profits need you
Oh, watch out for that deadline
And don’t stop we’re running behind
Profits need you
Profits need you
Profits need you
Oh, look out for the deadline
All the slaves on assembly line
Be more patient I hear them say
Would if I were you
Life is too short I hear them say
But why listen to you
Blinded 
Afraid of things I can’t see
Crawling through the shadows
This darkness is endless
Look into the sky
Find the dance of burning lights 
Night sky 
From this satellite
When it turns black revealing 
The shortness of our sight
The world that spins around me
Much smaller than it seems to be
So I escape 
Into the fade
Flying inward 
My mirror dream
Shining stars that I know
Their dust is
Running through my blood... my blood...
Night sky
From this satellite 
When it turns black revealing 
The shortness of our sight
The world that spins around me
Much smaller than it seems to be
So I escape into the fade
Beyond the night sky
Beyond the blue sky
Beyond the black sky 
Beyond the night sky
我养的马，会说话，
阴天时家长里短，
晴天时新闻联播。
动物一旦会说话，就变得神经兮兮。
说不爱吃草，要喝酒。
说不爱吃草，要喝酒。
我养的马，爱散步，
四肢只用了一半，
酒瓶子摇摇晃晃。
和沿路的树林们，完成了气体交换。
说众生平等，要社保。
说众生平等，要社保。
办公室里，在开会，
今天是财务报表，
明天是员工检讨。
马和我一样平躺，在床上偷用音响。
说不想上班，要奔跑。
说不想上班，要奔跑。
……
不要哭啦，不要哭啦，
啤酒瓶和梦一起破碎啦。
……
不要睡啦，不要睡啦。
你的主人好久没喝醉啦。
Outside it’s still sunny
My thoughts are all muddy 
Breathe in and the hairs on my skin rise
Black clouds form above me
You, I would see it’s you
This too, I would see is you
Fangs siphon the honey out
Speak the word
Fight the word
Fear the word
Our cycle
Blissful then turns painful
Your touch has
tapped into my brain though
I’m passive when it comes to fate so 
Arms open
Why can’t I feel you?
Love, foul love, foul love
When I’m near you
 I can see you
And I hear you
Why can’t I feel you?
Now the rain starts falling
And your voice comes calling
Those eels your body conceals
Move to start spine crawling
Our cycle 
Blissful then turns hate-full
Your flesh has got me so deranged, though
I’m hostile
All up in that face hole
Eyes open
Why can’t I feel you?
I failed in love
I won’t fail in life 
Time I be alone
Time I feel right
I’ll stop feeding it roses
Time I play it right
I’m simple when it comes to bait, though
Jaws open, why can’t I feel you?

kico你最近过的怎么样？
我突然想起你微笑的样子、
虽然这样的笑容已经不属于我、
对了！你还是和那个我讨厌的女人在一起吗？
我真的想告诉你我依然恨她、
祝福你们幸福的摩擦、辛苦啦、

时间会让你把一切都忘掉
再给你一个你想要的真相
还有什么，你不能忘掉
看起来都很美

,And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
,Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
,See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna
,Baby mama drama's screamin on and
,Too much for me to wanna
,Stay in one spot, another jam or not
,Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
,I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
,Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
,Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
,I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
,So here I go is my shot.
,Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got
,You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
,You own it, you better never let it go

,This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
,You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

,
,

,
,
,
,I had a way then
,Losing it all on my own
,I had a heart then
,But the queen has been overthrowned
,And I'm not sleeping now
,The dark is too hard to beat
,And I'm not keeping up
,The strength I need to push me
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,shine me when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me
,They're calling, calling, calling me
,Noises, I play within my head
,Touch my own skin
,And hope they'll still breathing
,And I think back to when
,My brother and my sister slept
,In an unknown place
,The only time I feel safe
,they're calling, calling, calling me
,shine me when I'm alone?
,whoa oh oh oh whoa
,oh yeah!
,Solo
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Dreaming when they're gone
,The snow glows
,white on the mountain tonight
,
,Not a footprint to be seen
,
,A kingdom of isolation
,and it looks like I'm the king
,
,The wind is howling like
,this swirling storm inside
,Couldn't keep it in,
,heaven knows I tried
,
,Don't let them in,
,don't let them see
,Be the good boy you always
,have to be
,Conceal, don't feel,
,don't let them know
,
,Well now they know
,Let it go, let it go
,
,Can't hold it back anymore
,Let it go, let it go
,Turn away and slam the door
,
,I don't care
,what they're going to say
,Let the storm rage on
,The cold never bothered me anyway.
,
,It's funny how some distance
,Makes everything seems small
,
,And the fears that once controlled me
,
,Can't get to me at all
,
,Up here in the cold thin air
,I finally can breathe
,
,I know I've left a life behind
,but I'm too relieved to grieve!
,
,It's time to see what I can do
,To test the limits and break through
,No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
,
,I'm free
,Let it go, let it go
,I am one with the wind and sky
,Let it go, let it go,
,You'll never see me cry
,
,Here I stand and here I'll stay
,Let the storm rage on
,
,My power flurries through
,the air into the ground
,My soul is spiraling in frozen
,fractals all around
,
,I'm never going back
,The past is in the past
,Let it go, let it go
,
,And I'll rise like the break of dawn
,Let it go, let it go
,That perfect boy is gone
,Here I stand in the light of day
,
,Let the storm rage on
,The cold never bothered me anyway!
,
,
,
,
,
,
,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts
,I'm standing there
,On the balcony in summer air
,See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
,See you make your way through the crowds and say hello (hello)
,Little did I know
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
,And my Daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet!'
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you please don't go
,And I said,
,'Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.'
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlett letter
,And my Daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet!'
,But you were everything to me
,I was begging you please don't go
,And I said,
,'Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
,Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
,This love is difficult, but it's real
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
,It's a love story, baby just say yes.'
,I got tired of waiting,
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of the town
,And I said,
,'Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
,I keep waiting for you but you've never come
,Is this in my head, I don't know what to think.'
,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,
,'Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your Dad, you'll pick out a white dress
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,‘Cause we were both young when I first saw you
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,That's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,That's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
,I can't breathe
,But I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right
,It's like I'm in flight
,High of a love
,Drunk from the hate
,It's like I'm huffin' paint
,And I love it the more that I suffer
,I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown
,She resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me
,And I love it
,Wait
,Where you going
,I'm leaving you
,No you ain't come back
,We're running right back
,Here we go again
,It's so insane
,
,Cause when it's going good
,It's going great
,I'm Superman with the wind at his back
,She's Lois Lane
,But when it's bad it's awful
,I feel so ashamed
,I snap
,Who's that dude
,I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on her
,I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,That's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,That's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much
,You can barely breathe
,When you're with them
,You meet
,And neither one of you
,Even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah them chills
,Used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
,You swore you've never hit 'em
,Never do nothing to hurt 'em
,Now you're in each other's face
,Spewing venom
,In Your words
,When you spit 'em
,You push
,Pull each other's hair
,Scratch' claw' bit 'em
,Throw 'em down' pin 'em
,So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
,It's the rage that took over
,It controls you both
,So they say it's best to go your separate ways
,Guess that they don't know ya
,Cause today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over
,It's a different day
,Sound like broken records
,Playing' over
,But you promised her
,Next time you'll show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave
,Out the window
,Guess that's why they call it window pane
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,Now I know we said things
,Did things
,That we didn't mean
,And we fall back
,Into the same patterns
,Same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love
,You're just as blinded
,Baby please come back
,It wasn't you
,Baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship
,Isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens
,When a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much
,To walk away though
,Come inside
,Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity
,In my voice when I talk
,Told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed
,I'll aim my fist
,At the dry wall
,Next time
,There will be no next time
,I apologize
,Even though I know it's lies
,I'm tired of the games
,I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
,I'mma tie her to the bed
,And set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

,You ready?!
,Lets go!
,Yeah,
,for those of you that want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all (c'mon!)
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,He doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
,But fuck em, he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,It's all about reality and making some noise
,Makin the story - makin sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up! let's go!
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status but still leavin them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because he makes a livin from writin raps
,Put it together himself, now the picture connects
,Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,He's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin his way to the top
,People think its a common owners name
,People keep askin him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No he's livin proof, Got him rockin the booth
,He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent
,Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
,Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?!
,Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow
,Now the record with the Virgins takin over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
,You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!
,Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
,Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
,Do you ever feel already buried deep?
,6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing.
,Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'cause there's a spark in you.
,You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine.
,Just own the night like the 4th of July.
,Baby you're a firework,
,Come on, show 'em what you're worth,
,Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
,As you shoot across the sky.
,Baby, you're a firework,
,Come on, let your colors burst,
,Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
,You're gonna leave 'em falling down-own-own.
,You don't have to feel like a waste of space,
,You're original, cannot be replaced.
,If you only knew what the future holds,
,After a hurricane comes a rainbow.
,Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed,
,So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road.
,Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow,
,And when it's time, you'll know.
,You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine,
,Just own the night like the 4th of July.
,'Cause baby you're a firework,
,Come on, show 'em what you're worth,
,Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
,As you shoot across the sky-y-y.
,Baby, you're a firework,

,Boom,boom,boom
,Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.

,never asking why
,We kissed, I fell under your spell a love
,no one could deny
,Don’t you ever say
,I just walked away
,I will always want you
,I can’t live a lie
,Running for my life

,And instead of using force

,Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
,I found your address and got your phone number too
,Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
,Been to secret places you think nobody knows
,If I had to live without you
,Nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I've been hanging 'round all the places you haunt
,Spying on your friends to find out what you want
,Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
,Follow you around driving home in your car
,Do I have to breathe without you?
,'Cause nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do

,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I know this must be wrong
,It can't go on
,This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
,And making me a mockery
,This must be wrong
,It can't go on
,So won't somebody free me from this misery?
,Bring my baby closer to me
,'Cause no one else can love you like I do

,I feel like I've been locked up tight
,For a century of lonely nights

,I had a way then
,Losing it all on my own
,I had a heart then
,But the queen has been overthrown
,And I'm not sleeping now
,The dark is too hard to beat
,And I'm not keeping up
,The strength I need to push me
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
,Calling, calling, calling home
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Noises, I play within my head
,Touch my own skin
,And hope they'll still be there
,And I think back to when
,My brother and my sister slept
,In another place
,The only time I feel safe
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
,Calling, calling, calling home
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Lights, lights...
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
,Calling, calling, calling home
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Home, home
,Lights, lights, lights...

,Cursing me  boy you played
,through my mind like a symphony
,There's no way to describe what you do to me
,You just do to me  what you do
,And it feels like I've been rescued
,I've been set free
,I am hyptonized by your destiny
,You are magical, lyrical  beautiful
,You are  I want you to know baby

,Maybe it'll never come around*
,Maybe let you push me to the ground
,I'll go 'cause if I don't it's taking me down
,And I deal 'cause none of it is real
,I deal 'cause I'm covering to heal
,I'll go no need to reap the seeds that I sow

,I'm just a loser in the game of love
,I'm just a stray boy in the shade
,And how I Wish to know what love is like
,To find someone to contemplate
,There's a voice and a million answers
,To the questions I don't ask a demon-I've got to contain
,When I'm walking through the fen
,Gonna deep into the black
,There are whispers that I can't restrain
,Don't give in
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,So you're an angel meant to walk down here
,And you believe it's all divine
,And you don't play by all those temporal rules
,Watch the world begin to die
,Alright-when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
,I've been crashing from the sky
,Fallen to care for the pray
,They put a spoke right in your wheel
,I'm the one to dare the weak
,To push you all over the pain
,You give in
,Oh...
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
,He's got treasure in his eyes that he gonna turn to clay
,Hm,I'm a stranger
,I'm a changer and I'm a danger
,Maybe...
,Fallen angel-waiting for the prey
,The devil has come to take a mainmed away
,Penetration of the twisted mind
,The evil is out for the weak and blind
,I can feel it in your voice
,Ever so sweet
,No
,Do I really have a choice?
,No,no,no!
,Oh,you burn your feet n unholy ground
,You roam the barren wicked plains abound
,In evil eyes and evil speak
,About it all your evil freaks
,When you say it's all divine and meant to be
,What about your flesh and blood and defire like me?
,Their evil eyes are looking down on you
,And those who don't are losing sight of you
,Face the rage to chase away
,The specter of disgrace and shame
,Withered roses dying on the ledge
,A withered dreamer standing on the edge
,You dream of love but you wake up to pain
,You're better off to join in my game
,Then she'll better off to cry contrite tears
,One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
,Rise to fame
,(your time has come)
,Time will come
,(to take the sun)
,Make your claim-you're drawn to the sound
,Time has come-you're leaving ground
,Rise to fame-the flight of the crow
,Time will come-cross the line
,Your time has come
,For the crow to fly away
,It's a flight to hell
,Can you hear the bell
,The devil has come
,To take your soul away

作词 : Blasphemer, Maniac
Caress the deceitful snake, 
The one who speaks in tongues
Of all my devastating truths, 
Collect the power of my dreams
A fiendish lust a hallow trust.
Cast by the devious fire demons, 
A thousand whorish tongues
In Black Death, salute the visions, 
Mayhem of living, infected blood.
In this, dark night of the soul!!(Chorus)
I close my eyes to the world, 
Kiss my skinless corpus,
Make me revel in your weak souls, 
Make me feast on your nightmares.,
Death's heads enshrined in my head, 
I deal exclusively in mysterious pain
The mystical blood runs tonight, 
Gifting through your inner thighs,
I seal the orbits of misanthropy.
A moment of inconceivable lust
,I have my mother's dreams
,I have my father's eyes
,You can't take that from me
,Just go ahead and try
,The cursed city sleeps
,Watch ions in the sky
,Preparing to unleash
,Let loose a mighty cry
,Can nobody save us?
,Will anyone try?
,The pyre is burning
,The severance is dying
,And all along they say it
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Hold my hand to help see
,Right there in front of me
,Help is on the way
,
,Five thousand feet below
,As black smoke engulfs the sky
,The ocean floor explodes
,Eleven mothers cry
,My bones all resonate
,A burning lullaby
,You can't take that from me
,Just go ahead and try
,She says that's the shoreline
,With hands in the air
,Her words miss the dark light
,Does anyone care?
,And all along they say it
,Help is on the way
,said' they
,Help is on the way
,said' they

I never count on yesterday
Because the past can also change
I'll never give myself away
Life is worthwhile on the edge
Words sound so hollow in the cold
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
Signs never told me anything
Nothing I could know for sure
I never knew what she would bring
Or what I am to her today
My words...
Almost swallowed by the snow
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
She is the poison in my mind
The thorns in my head
She has no mountain to be climbed
No faults to regret
I never count on yesterday
Because the past may not exist
I'll never give myself away
When there's reason to resist
Words draped in crystals melt away
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow

,6 a.m. Christmas morning.
,No shadows,
,no reflections here.
,Lying cheek to cheek
,in your cold embrace.
,So soft and so tragic
,as a slaughterhouse.
,You press the knife
,against your heart.
,And say,
,“I love you, so much you must kill me now.”
,I love you
,so much
,you must kill me now.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come.
,Digging your smile apart
,with my spade-tounge.
,The hole is where the heart is.
,We built this tomb together,
,and I won’t fill it alone.
,Beyond the pale
,everything is black,
,no turning back.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come
,Blood-stained sheets
,in the shape of your heart,
,this is where it starts…
,Blood-stained sheets
,in the shape of your heart,
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,6:19 and I know I’m ready
,Drive me off the mountain.
,You’ll burn,
,I’ll eat your ashes.
,The impossible wheels seducing
,our corpse.
,If I was your vampire,
,certain as the moon,
,instead of killing time,
,we’ll have each other
,until the sun.
,If I was your vampire,
,death waits for no one.
,Hold my hands
,across your face,
,because I think
,our time has come.
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.
,this is where it starts.
,This is where it will end.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.
,Here comes the moon again.

,Never  again  will  I  taste  in  your  passion
,this  vain  call  that  dies...
,Never  across  sacrifice  will  I  lose  my  dark  guide...
,Dazed  in  my  dark  and  ephemeral  wail  that  rapes  a  cool  light,
,in  a  corpse-like,haunted,nightmare  I  die...
,Never  in  life
,After  tonight
,Through  my  sighs
,Don ’t  you  change
,I  will  lie
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Wavin ’this  shine,overwhelmed  by  this  whirl,
,and  you  engravin ’my  gaze  heavenwards  in  your  face,
,are  greedy  of  grace  and  lust.
,Graspin ’your  heart,
,you  mourn  through  risin ’of  holy  embraces.
,Groanin ’through  this  tearflow,I  feel  It ’s  getting  dark...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,maybe  this  light,Blind  Lantern,in  the  Silence,is  blindin ’my  mind...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,
,never  a  light  can  die,Dark  Lantern,darklin ’in  light...
,Always  arisin ’over  moulderin ’,enlightened  swear,

"i was born amidst the purple waterfalls.
i was weak, yet not unblessed.
dead to the world. alive for the journey.
one night i dreamt a white rose withering,
a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.
i dreamt all my future. relived my past.
a witnessed the beauty of the beast"

where have all the feelings gone?
why has all the laughter ceased?
why am i loved only when i'm gone?
gone back in time to bless the child

think of me long enough to make a memory
come bless the child one more time

how can i ever feel again?
given the chance would i return?
i've never felt so alone in my life
as i drank from a cup which was counting my time
there's a poison drop in this cup of man
to drink it is to follow the left hand path

"where have all the feelings gone?
why is the deadliest sin - to love as i loved you?
now unblessed, homesick in time,
soon to be freed from care, from human pain.
my tale is the most bitter truth:
time pays us but with earth & dust, and a dark, silent grave.
remember, my child: without innocence the cross is only iron,
hope is only an illusion & ocean soul's nothing but a name...
the child bless thee & keep thee forever"
Godlove and rest my soul
With this sundown neverending
The feel is gone yet you ain't gonna see me fail
I am the decadence of your world
I am an eider covered in oil
Happy hunting, you double-faced carnivore

Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high

The music is dead, the amen is said
The kiss of faith is what I beg
A loving heart 'n soul for sale

Tell me why...

Leave me be
And cease to tell me how to feel
To grieve, to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide

Till love do me part

See me ruined by my own creations

Leave me be...

Dead Boy's alive but without sense
I need a near-death experience
Heart once bold
Now turned to stone
Perfection my messenger from hell

Wine turns to water
Campfires freeze, loveletters burn
Romance is lost
Lord, let me be wrong in this pain

Temporary pain, eternal shame
To take part in this devil's chess game
Spit on me, let go, get rid of me
And try to survive your stupidity

Obsessed throughout the end of time, oh yeah

The drug of choice is found
The hate machine keeps moving on, oh yeah

作曲 : Pantera
I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day
While you're mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you
(Pre) You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own
(Chorus) Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son
I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in cast you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule YOU fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak -- I speak
(Pre)

Compassion's a cage

Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again

Sunken, sooner or later
We crawl our way back into our favorite hole
Drunken, swallow the savior
And follow him to hang from the highest pole

Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
Tell me more about the man I should have been
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again

You took him away
without a trace or tear, erased from the story
Hate fills these bloodshot eyes
He was gone with no warning
I cry for peace, but none is lent to me
I pray for relief, just pull me closer, please let me sleep
Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?
Why won't you answer me?
Have you turned your face away
answer me
Is it heaven or hell where will he stay?
I'm done wondering where he went and how a good man lives to die
Desperate to hear your voice of reason
Speak up
speak up and let him sleep
Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?
Give me a reason
Why you took my friend
Is it because he lost his way, I'll only know in the end
I just need to know why
I'm lost on the inside
Replace the happiness that left this empty heart
Erase the death that now haunts my every though
Erase the death
Let him walk the earth again
Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?

I've woken up cold
Feeling like the loneliest boy in the world
Waking up freezing
Knowing that you're gone
I'm woken up sick to stomach
Knowing I can never see you again
Waking up so lonely
Knowing that you're gone
I'm having one way conversations with you inside my head
Repeating those words
That fucking kill me to have never said
It's these thoughts that I carry with me
It's that knot in my stomach, it's the pain that surrounds me
I just wish I could say this to you
That after everything that you put us through
I thought that the worst in me was everything that I got from you
(I just missed the chance to tell you)
If I scream loud enough, do you think you could hear me?
And I could tell you one last time how much you meant to me
And how just one little word would help me write a better ending
And I could tell you one last time how much you meant to me
And I could say that I tried my best, and it would help me put you to rest
There is a light and it guides us through
All the heartache that life decides to throw at you
Now I can sing our songs
So much louder than before
They will keep you with me
The soil won't matter any more

,this song goes out to all you fucking quitters out there)

,don't even know which direction to go?
,Are you really that anxious to drift life away,
,and just give up on yourself?
,You better dance to the beat of living.

,Reach out for help if you're falling,
,We're in this together.

,I still remember,
,In an outmoded cab stuck in the midnight traffic，
,Surrounded by the pouring rain.
,Her voice cut though the moist air and car window，
,Asked me things about “Where do you want to go”，
,“What do you want to be ” sort of things.“
,And I was sleepy and palter，
,So I said “I can be whatever I want，
,We can go wherever we want to go”.
,She just smiled，within pair eyes full of stars.
,And then she just disappeared from my life til now on.
,Over past decade，
,I still hovered and wandered in the same position where I used to be，
,Tried to live a life，
,Tried to grab something priceless but almost invisible from nowhere，
,But I knew every time I try to move on，
,Those shining spots became more and more specific.
,Every time I tried to give up，
,Holy darkness pacified me erased all my regrets away，
,I guess finally I know what kind person I really want to be,
,I got a positive mind，
,But always thinking negative，
,You put a smile upon your face to pretend everything is fine,
,But the tears tracks can't cover your lies,
,So I guess in anyway, we are both the same species.
,I'm living in the bright side, but always assuming there will be an upside down，
,You are away from the present right now but more then just a memory,
,So finally I realized that,
,Reality is much more dramatic then our dreams.
,Indeed.
,Try to run away from here,
,Try to run away from the lies,
,Try to run away from yourself,
,In my song,
,It’s the only place we know.
,In my song,
,It’s the only place we owned.
,In my song,
,It’s the only place we know.
,In my song,
,It’s the only place we owned.

The early dawn hold back the despair of night 
I will guard your smile for my whole life
This is the new beginning, every time i die 
coming again and again, a different you every time we met
There’s something important deep inside my heart  
that I would never forget, never forget
To receive your love in the endless birth and death
Gluttony
Misleads your way of pursuing
Pride
Slices your heart into pieces
The whisper of witch lingering around my ears
I’ve turned down all your dreadful predictions
The blue hair emerged in my mind over and over again
It’s time to search for the real destiny

I can’t describe with smile the scene you longed for the future 
The limited capability breaks everything down
Just like a struggling maggot 
I hate myself for being weak, mean, dirty, and good for nothing
That is what it’s all about
In the endless night, you’re the only one who shines for a dark and trembling brain 

Oh
Taboo of ghosts
cannot be accepted
Oh
You’ll be stronger
with your sister’s shadow
 
Frozen time, frozen heart
Stop everything at the night on fire
Why are you with smile like that 
while having everything lost
You’re the one who holds out your hands
to comfort my heart in the dark
in each cycle of birth and death
Is that the real you everytime I met?
Memories are fading away, 
reminding me of all my fault
While the sloth insane forever lasts

Frozen time, frozen heart

to comfort my heart in the dark

Is that the real you everytime I met?
Memories are fading away, 
reminding me of all my fault
While the sloth insane forever lasts
don’t be afraid
open your eyes
defeat your enemy
Fight for 
what you believe
Overstep the ego
I will always be with you

you called my name
something happened inside me
you hold my hands
something sparkled in your eyes

we are inseparable
I can't take it anymore
we lit ourself a flame
and end this struggle

Fear and despair engulfed me
You will never take me away

don’t be afraid
open your eyes
defeat your enemy
Fight for 
what you believe

Cruel broken memories will never fade,
Sorrowful reincarnation goes on,
I will not let go,
Waiting to see you again,
Your warm breath,
became unforgettable,
I just want to hear that unsung lullaby

Sharp pain tears my body,
Innocent flesh won’t stop bleeding,
Grief from farewell drowned my mind,
Guilt parted me with the God.

 I was created in the void,
Fear makes me not able to cry,
I am sealed in the endless dark,
Death brings me the gift called freedom

Revive the doll with the desecrated hands,
Accompany him every day,
Humming that lullaby,
“Good night baby,
Wish you a pleasant dream”

Lean next to your pillow without words,
Watch you in every silent night.
How much apathy and fickleness is covered
Under your holy and pure face

I saw the doll winkled softly,
The smile turned out so clearly,
I want to hug you tight,
In this piercing winter night,

The holy veil dyed in deep red,
The doll wears a bloody smile,
My dearest mother,
I have finally came back,
Don’t you go sleep,
Sing me another lullaby

The voice of tears dropping,
The voice of blood draining,
How much I want to sing you that old song,
Yet only dead silence is haunting.

 Cruel broken memories will never fade,
Sorrowful reincarnation goes on
,I left behind me the comfort of a normal life,traded it all for my sake.
,I never questioned my choice or even felt that I should.
,It's always crystal-clear.
,I spent more time in this room to write all this than with my family and all my friends.
,I traded my everything to feel free to walk my own path.
,I won't be the one who forget his dreams,I'll make sure to remember them.
,I'll take a glance at the Earth when I'll be on the roofs of the world.

,I might have took the longest way to leave my dream but every miles will bring me closer to it.
,I'll build it all of my bare hands,will follow the sun on its journey.
,I wanna tame this heart which is mine,feel that I'm leading my life.
,I hold the key in my hands.
,I left behind me the comfort of a normal life,traded it all for my sake.
,I never felt a regret.
,I never questioned my choice or even felt that I should.
,It's always crystal-clear.
,These lines that I write are the mirror of my soul.
,Like a letter to this kid who played alone.
,Now this kid do feel like a man,he bear the weight of his dreams,
,stands just before your eyes.He found a meaning at his life.
,He wanna know ...He wanna know what this life can bring him.
,He wanna know where this road will lead,so take him away and show him places he'd never seen.
,I remember the promise that I have made to myself.
,The kid I was has grown up,but all his dreams stayed the same.
,The souvenirs of his words linger inside of my head.
,It's like crystal-clear .
,This is us versus the fate.
,I wanna know...I wanna know what this damn life can be.
,I wanna see where the road will lead,so take me away and show me these places I've never seen.
,I left behind me the comfort of a normal life,traded it all for my sake.I never felt a regret.

Deserving wonderful baby 
In despite of that defect 
Of listening to that wild music 
And than playing war videogames 
But you are lucky man 
Because I've got some plans for you 
Refined violin lessons 
And the most celebrated school 
Poor baby, he uses his violin 
Poor baby, almost well as a machine gun 
Poor baby, insanity from adolescence 
Grows through me a killer from hell 
The rising sons throw away 
All their father's dreams 
Don't let me be born 
If you didn't live 
The only right was the grandfather 
He said: "finally he's gone" 
While parents threaten suddenly "We'll grow another one" 
Just you must know 
Your guy is not so wise 
To grow behind your violin 
Take your eyes to this massacre 
Was it your dream? 
This story tells to me 
Don't let me be born 
If you did not live 
Your guy is not so wise 
To grow behind your violin 
Take your eyes through this fire

,The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
,We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
,And the Russians fire another round
,We get so near yet so far away
,We won＇t live to fight another day.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,We get so close near enough to fight
,When a Russian gets me in his sights
,He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
,A burst of rounds take my horse below.
,And as I lay there gazing at the sky
,My body＇s numb and my throat is dry
,And as I lay forgotten and alone
,Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

,White man came across the sea
,He brought us pain and misery
,He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
,He took our game for his own need
,We fought him hard we fought him well
,Out on the plains we gave him hell
,But many came too much for cree
,Oh will we ever be set free?
,Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
,Galloping hard on the plains
,Chasing the redskins back to their holes
,Fighting them at their own game
,Murder for freedom a stab in the back
,Women and children and cowards attack
,Run to the hills run for your lives
,Run to the hills run for your lives
,Soldier blue on the barren wastes
,Hunting and killing their game
,Raping the women and wasting the men
,The only good indians are tame
,Selling them whisky and taking their gold
,Enslaving the young and destroying the old
,Run to the hills run for your lives

,The only place where you can dream,
,living here is not what it seems.
,Ship of white light in the sky,
,nobody there to reason why.
,Here I am, I'm not really there,
,smiling faces ever so rare.
,A let's walk in deepest space,
,living here just isn't the place.
,Stalks of light come from the ground,
,when I cry there isn't a sound.
,All my feelings cannot be held,
,I'm happy in my new strange world.
,Shades of green grasses twine,
,girls drinking plasma wine.
,A look at love,
,a dream unfolds,
,living here,
,you'll never grow old.
,Don't you hear me call?
,Ooh
,The morals of life and the perils of death
,Take the wrong way out running out of breath
,Meet my match in the afterlife
,Suppress the demons that plague the night
,A tortured mind is a safe place to go
,But the truth lurks down in the dark below
,Step inside my inquisitive mind
,Are you scared at what you just might find
,
,See myself in the hall of mirrors
,A different shape every step I take
,A different mind every step of the line
,But in the end they are all mine
,Laughing sorrow inside your head
,Can't get out just a feeling of dread
,I know this burden's a heavy load
,A dark mistake never ending road
,
,The black jack king and the red queen clash
,The artful dodger he counts his stash
,The joker's wild like an impish child

,Planes overhead go search destroy
,The ones below human decoy
,
,I need somebody to save me
,
,Meanwhile we play the waiting game
,The clock is struck the horse is lame
,And when we think that this is done

,Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
,'bout a thing that I saw
,One night wandering in the everglades
,I'd one drink but no more
,I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
,Gazing up at the stars
,Not aware of a presence so near to me
,Watching my every move
,Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
,As something rushed me from the trees
,Took me to an unholy place
,And that is where I fell from grace
,Then they summoned me over to join in with them
,To the dance of the dead
,In to the circle of fire I followed them
,In to the middle I was led
,As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
,But still I wanted to go
,And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
,As I walked onto the coals
,And I felt I was in a trance
,And my spirit was lifted from me
,And if only someone had the chance
,To witness what happened to me
,And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
,All had death in their eyes
,Lifeless figures they were undead all of them
,They had ascended from hell
,As I danced with the dead
,my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
,Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead
,Until the time came to reunite us both
,My spirit came back down to me
,I didn't know if I was alive or dead
,As the others, all joined in with me
,And took the attention away from me
,By luck then a skirmish started
,When they took their gaze from me
,Was the moment that I fled
,I ran like hell faster than the wind
,But behind I did not glance
,One thing that I did not dare
,Was to look just straight ahead
,When you know that your time has come around
,You know you'll be prepared for it
,Say your last goodbyes to everyone
,Drink and say a prayer for it
,When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
,And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
,When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
,And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
,To this day I guess I'll never know
,Just why they let me go
,But I'll never go dancing no more

,I left alone my mind was blank
,I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
,What did I see can I believe that what I saw
,that night was real and not just fantasy
,Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
,reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
,Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
,and brings me to despair
,The night was black was no use holding back
,Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
,In the mist dark figures move and twist
,was all this for real or some kind of hell

,Hell and fire was spawned to be released
,Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised

,Sacrifice is going on tonight
,This can't go on I must inform the law
,Can this still be real or some crazy dream

,they seem to mesmerise me...can't avoid their eyes
,666 the Number of the Beast
,666 the one for you and me
,I'm coming back I will return
,And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
,I have the fire I have the force
,I have the power to make my evil take its course
,You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
,You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
,So when you're waiting for the next attack
,You'd better stand there's no turning back.
,The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
,But on this battlefield no one wins
,The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
,As I plunge on into certain death.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

,The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
,The mighty roar of the Russian guns
,And as we race towards the human wall
,The screams of pain as my comrades fall.
,We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
,And the Russians fire another round
,We get so near yet so far away
,We won't live to fight another day.
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,(solo)
,We get so close near enough to fight
,When a Russian gets me in his sights
,He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
,A burst of rounds take my horse below.
,And as I lay there gazing at the sky
,My body's numb and my throat is dry
,And as I lay forgotten and alone
,Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

,Steve walks warily down the street,
,with the brim pulled way down low
,Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
,machine guns ready to go
,Are you ready, Are you ready for this
,Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,And another one gone, and another one gone
,Another one bites the dust
,Hey, I'm gonna get you too
,Another one bites the dust
,How do you think I'm going to get along,
,without you, when you're gone
,You took me for everything that I had,
,and kicked me out on my own
,Are you happy, are you satisfied
,How long can you stand the heat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,another one bites the dust
,another one bites the dust
,another one bites the dust
,another one bites the dust
,There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
,And bring him to the ground
,You can beat him
,You can cheat him
,you can treat him bad and leave him
,When he's down
,But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
,I'm standing on my own two feet
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,repeating the sound of the beat another one bites the dust another one bites the dust another one bites the dust another one bites the dust another one bites the dust

,Title: When Love Comes To Town
,I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
,I was under the waves
,Before love rescued me
,I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
,Now I stand accused of the things I've said
,Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,I used to make love under a red sunset
,I was making promises I was soon to forget
,She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
,But I left her standing before love came to town
,I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
,The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
,As the music played I saw my life turn around
,That was the day before love came to town
,When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,I was there when they crucified my Lord
,I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
,I threw the dice when they pierced his side
,But I've seen love conquer the great divide
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,
,You and I were meant to be
,Ain't no doubt about it
,No way to hide that sort of thing
,Now I'm waiting for something better
,Ain't nothing better worth imagining
,I, I keep on running
,I'm building bridges that
,I know you never wanted
,Look for my heart
,You stole it away
,Now on every single road that I could take
,Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
,I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
,Set me on Fire
,You set me
,Set me on Fire
,You can burn my bridges down
,Send this out to sea
,Send it where you want it
,You can take it note for note and not at all
,There's no filling up
,your spaces with fictionary places
,Imaginary faces they don't work at all
,I, I keep on running
,I'm building bridges that
,I know you never wanted
,Look for my heart
,You stole it away
,Now on every single road that I could take
,Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
,I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
,Set me on Fire
,You set me
,Set me on Fire
,Will you burn my bridges down?
,I want you to burn my bridges down, down
,I want you to burn my bridges down, yeah
,Set me on fire

,Shame on me well I had the beast you see
,And if he can take it
,I can take him home with me,
,Shame on her,

,And when we go lassooing you get lassooed,
,all of you
,And we\'re moving, so moving,
,so we are a boy, we are a girl
,So moving, so moving...
,Shame on the girl,

,Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
,Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
,Mama, can you help me try to understand
,Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
,My daddy lived a lie
,Its just the price that he paid
,Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
,Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
,That gets me through the night
,I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
,I'm gonna live my life
,Shining like a diamond
,Rolling with the dice
,Standing on the ledge
,Just show the wind how to fly
,When the world gets in my face
,I say, have a nice day
,Have a nice day
,Take a look around you, nothings what it seems
,We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
,Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
,Everybody, brave enough to take a stand
,I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
,Looking for forgiveness
,What’s left to believe?
,Ohhh~
,Now when this world keeps trying, to drag me down
,I've gotta raise my hands
,Gonna stand my ground
,I say, hey, have a nice day
,
,Here we go for the hundredth timeHand grenade pins in every line
,Throw them up and let something shine
,Going out of my fuckin mind
,Filthy mouth, no excuse
,Find a new place to hang this noose
,String me up from atop these roofs
,Knot it tight so I won't get loose
,The truth is you can stop and stare
,Run myself out and no one cares
,Dug the trench out, dug down there
,Put the shovel up out of reach somewhere
,Someone pour it in, make it a dirt dance floor again
,Say your prayers and stomp it out
,When they bring that chorus in
,I bleed it out,
,Digging deeper just to throw it away
,I bleed it out,
,Digging deeper just to throw it away
,I bleed it out,
,Digging deeper just to throw it away
,Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
,I bleed it out, go, stop the show
,Drop your boards and let sloppy show
,Shotgun opera lock and load
,Cock it back and then watch it go
,Momma help me, I've been cursed
,Death is rolling in every verse
,Candy paint on his brand new hearse
,Can't contain and he knows he works
,Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
,Doesn't matter how hard I try
,Half the words don't mean a thing
,And I know that I won't be satisfied
,So why, try ignore him?
,Make it a dirt-dance floor again
,Say your prayers and stomp it out
,When they bring that chorus in

,She's got a smile that it seems to me
,Reminds me of childhood memories
,Where everything
,Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
,Now and then when I see her face
,She takes me away to that special place
,And if I stared too long
,I'd probably break down and cry
,Sweet child o' mine
,Sweet love of mine
,She's got eyes of the bluest skies
,As if they thought of rain
,I hate to look into those eyes
,And see an ounce of pain
,Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
,Where as a child I'd hide
,And pray for the thunder
,And the rain
,To quietly pass me by
,Sweet child o' mine
,Sweet love of mine
,Sweet child o' mine
,Sweet love of mine
,Sweet child o' mine

,I’ve always heard to yourself be true
,I’ll take a chance and say

,
,Cause you have been there all my life
,But I was slow to recognize
,And I won’t let this love pass us by
,This time
,
,We used to play by the Oak Creek bank
,Then I rose into where the crickets sing
,I never knew she was my everything
,But now I feel her lying next to me
,Thinking ‘bout how it started so innocently
,But I guess that it was meant to be
,
,Cause you have been there all my life
,But I was slow to recognize
,And I won’t let this love pass us by

,I'm just a loser in the game of love
,I'm just a stray boy in the shade
,And how I Wish to know what love is like
,To find someone to contemplate
,There's a voice and a million answers
,To the questions I don't ask a demon-I've got to contain
,When I'm walking through the fen
,Gonna deep into the black
,There are whispers that I can't restrain
,Don't give in
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,So you're an angel meant to walk down here
,And you believe it's all divine
,And you don't play by all those temporal rules
,Watch the world begin to die
,Alright-when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
,I've been crashing from the sky
,Fallen to care for the pray
,They put a spoke right in your wheel
,I'm the one to dare the weak
,To push you all over the pain
,You give in
,Oh...
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
,He's got treasure in his eyes that he gonna turn to clay
,Hm,I'm a stranger
,I'm a changer and I'm a danger
,Maybe...
,Fallen angel-waiting for the prey
,The devil has come to take a mainmed away
,Penetration of the twisted mind
,The evil is out for the weak and blind
,I can feel it in your voice
,Ever so sweet
,No
,Do I really have a choice?
,No,no,no!
,Oh,you burn your feet n unholy ground
,You roam the barren wicked plains abound
,In evil eyes and evil speak
,About it all your evil freaks
,When you say it's all divine and meant to be
,What about your flesh and blood and defire like me?
,Their evil eyes are looking down on you
,And those who don't are losing sight of you
,Face the rage to chase away
,The specter of disgrace and shame
,Withered roses dying on the ledge
,A withered dreamer standing on the edge
,You dream of love but you wake up to pain
,You're better off to join in my game
,Then she'll better off to cry contrite tears
,One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
,Rise to fame
,(your time has come)
,Time will come
,(to take the sun)
,Make your claim-you're drawn to the sound
,Time has come-you're leaving ground
,Rise to fame-the flight of the crow
,Time will come-cross the line
,Your time has come
,For the crow to fly away
,It's a flight to hell
,Can you hear the bell
,The devil has come
,To take your soul away
,A flight to hell
,Alright
,I'm a stranger
,I'm a changer
,And I'm danger
,Fallen angel
,Waiting for the prey
,
,Still searching in dark city nights
,Unknown places, where should I start
,I'm lost and alone in the future world
,Out on the streets again, out on my own
,Just like always, nowhere to go
,Out on the streets again, fighting my war
,On the streets where I belong
,I carry an axe on my back
,Got no shelter when they attack
,I'm waiting prepared in the neon lights
,Out on the streets again, out on my own
,Just like always, nowhere to go
,Out on the streets again, fighting my war
,On the streets where I belong
,I'm out on the streets in the night
,I'm out on the streets in the night
,I'm out on the streets in the night
,Out on the streets again, out on my own
,Just like always, nowhere to go
,Out on the streets again, fighting my war
,On the streets
,Out on the streets again, out on my own

,I'm born into this world of joy and misery
,Where all the things go 'round in circles
,The sense of life, it seems to be
,An unknown mystery with ups and downs
,The good and the bad things
,Living, loving, weeping and mourning
,Finally the circle's closing in
,The circle of life, another chance, another try
,The circle of life as moments passing by
,The circle of life, another love, another lie
,The circle of life, will we end in paradise?
,What will come and what will be, no one can foresee
,Future gives the answers to all questions
,Some may choose a simple life, some decide to die
,Some are always searching for the reasons
,Living, loving, weeping and mourning
,Finally the final curtain falls
,The circle of life, another chance, another try
,The circle of life as moments passing by
,The circle of life, another love, another lie
,The circle of life, will we end in paradise?
,Time to spread my wings and learn to fly
,Try to leave it all behind
,Time to enter up the stage of life
,The whole world is mine
,I will take the train to anywhere
,Go through Heaven and through Hell
,I will make my way and I don't care
,If I win or fail
,In the circle of life, another chance, another try
,On the way to paradise, another love, another lie
,By an old drinking well on the grass so green
,I lay down and fell into a dream
,By a strange mellow sound from a silver eyed bird
,I opened my eyes but said no word
,On the pathway came walking a woman so bold
,Behind her in silence went the old
,
,Ahead ran the children with joyful cries
,Their faces were lifted to the skies
,The woman's hair was raven and black as the night
,Covered with stars shining bright
,As they passed by the well I saw that their eyes
,Were flaming like many coloured ice
,They passed by the well like a breeze pure and clean
,Soon they were nowhere to be seen
,
,When I woke up alone on the grass so green
,I looked into the well to catch the dream
,The water was rising and I felt a chill
,I willed the water to be still
,There was a face in the mirror like a face out of time
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,There was a face in the mirror
,and the face wasn't mine
,The eyes held a shimmery shine

,The sea is rough
,The spindrift cold
,The bridge is under fire
,The master left the sinking ship
,as waves were rising higher
,Unbaptized
,Unconverted
,Just a henchman on the verge of throwing high
,aims overboard to feed the surge
,But if I fail or if I fall
,I’ll be aid and consolation
,If I range or if I crawl
,I will shelter you my love
,If I starve or if I sear
,I’ll be faith and inspiration
,Raise my hope and ease the fear
,I’ll be there to back you up
,The sand like glow
,The desert wide
,The sun truncated brains
,The well dried up and
,thoughts are like a caravan in chains
,Bedraggled and ahungered
,Just a traveler in search of confidence and
, devotion before it burns
,But if I fail or if I fall
,I’ll be aid and consolation

,If I starve or if I sear

,Raise my hope and ease the fear

,A lightning strike on killing fields
,The soil is soaked with blood
,A deafening burst
,The smell of death and faces blurred with mud
,Ingenuous
,Blameless
,A peace seeker in the jam
,But I’m stuck in here till judgment day
,on ruined land

,I still can feel your arms around me
,and time cannot erase
,since you went away
,I couldn't find a way to help me through
,all the colours turn to blue
,but you never gave me time to say I'm sorry
,and you know that's so true
,so true
,you will never know how much I could love you
,cuz you let me down without a reason why
,let me tell you now, my love will surround you
,even after I run out of tears to cry
,we could've found a way
,it ended on a bridge to nowhere
,and now it's hard to let you go
,dancing memories
,they ask me who was wrong or right
,they won't let me sleep at night
,and out different worlds, so often got between us
,it's all yesterday's rain
,I have tried to stop in vain

,All his life he did his best for all
,And the crown of laughter hanging low
,The spotlight in the ring
,The choruses that sing
,The paint and masquerade was just a show
,
,Happiness around
,Just a soul lonely in the crowd
,
,His heart is all alone
,No one wants the tears of a clown
,The living of the glory and applause
,The circus tent, the only home he knows
,The cover-up is bold,
,The mask becoming cold
,It’s easier to let the eyelids close
,Happiness around
,The clown – the clown
,His heart is all alone
,The final curtain falls for all to see
,The final score, the circus melody
,His star that shone so bright,
,Gave comfort in the night
,The light that always held him set him free
,The clown – the clown
,His heart is all alone

,Where dips the rocky highland
,Of Sleuth Wood in the lake
,There lies a leafy island
,Where flapping herons wake
,The drowsy water-rats
,There we've hid our faery vats
,Full of berries
,And of reddest stolen cherries
,Come away, O human child
,To the waters and the wild
,With a faery, hand in hand
,For the world's more full of weeping
,Than you can understand.
,Where the wave of moonlight glosses
,The dim grey sands with light
,By far off furthest Rosses
,We foot it all the night
,Weaving olden dances
,Mingling hands and mingling glances
,Till the moon has taken flight
,To and fro we leap
,And chase the frothy bubbles
,Whilst the world is full of troubles
,And is anxious in its sleep.
,Come away, O human child
,To the waters and the wild
,With a faery, hand in hand
,For the world's more full of weeping
,Than you can understand.
,Where the wandering water gushes
,From the hills above Glen-Car
,In pools among the rushes
,That scarce could bathe a star
,We seek for slumbering trout
,And whispering in their ears
,Give them unquiet dreams
,Leaning softly out
,From ferns that drop their tears
,Over the young streams
,Come away, O human child
,To the waters and the wild
,With a faery, hand in hand
,For the world's more full of weeping
,Than you can understand.
,Away with us he's going
,The solemn-eyed
,He'll hear no more the lowing
,Of the calves on the warm hillside
,Or the kettle on the hob
,Sing peace into his breast
,Or see the brown mice bob
,Round and round the oatmeal chest.
,For he comes, the human child
,To the waters and the wild
,With a faery, hand in hand
,For the world's more full of weeping
,Than you can understand.

Sacred the enclosing welkin of dawn
As the blazing red pours over the firmament
The first light runs through my outstretched hands
I see your face, shining on me
Puissance never running dry
Thy maul and staff
They comfort me
Thou art my shepherd, I shall not want
Thy maul and staff, they comfort me
Thou maketh me to lie down in pastures green
Thou leadest me beside the still waters
Bright sun of the night
Begetter, sempiternal force, fire of existence
Sparks of life emit when you strike
Your mallet's target is never missed
No man can fathom the vastness in your hand
Sucellos
Atir aissom
Rodatis buiotutos
Celle!
The times surrender, sun of the Otherworld
The wolf's hunt won't be in vain
As the raven homes and finds the isle
Nantosuelta's noble servant
Escorting the soul
Into the darkness where life is born

Until you come and sit awhile with me.直到你降临于我身旁的那一刻
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;你唤醒了我，让我得以屹立于高山之巅；

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,Summer in the hills
,Those hazy days I do remember
,We were running still
,Had the whole world at our feet
,Watching seasons change
,Our roads were lined with adventure
,Mountains in the way
,Couldn't keep us from the sea
,Here we stand open arms
,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change
,
,
, < EarthQuake>
, Here we go !!
, Bring that beat back
, Microphone set yo microphone rec
, Code Red war like “AWACS” on the “revved up” cassette
, Cause I’m a soldier giving me the nerves like boulder
, Making a vocal call
, putting the lights out the storm
, Airwaves uproar like a cellular phone
, I hate snakes like Indiana Jones
, while “harakatan” did the tracks like storm
, mixing tracks like “tapper” rhymes busted thorugh your bones
, I get your Heart and I'd never wanna
, Feel you like “drama” or
, Gee cause my rhyme is the key
, Open up your mind and pass in the energy
, To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3
, I make DO with the RE and MI
, Shine, on your mind, get busy one time
, Let the girls know that you're good to go
, I'll rock the show like I'll rock you whole
, # music
, Just this alley straight off the main “tow”
, because I “ricochet” it just get better
, and then i come out of the light because you know i'm legit
, i'm just in Hollywood let you know that'd be good
, just got the style let soak for some time
, and then i rock your microphone and make a “yaboodoowah”
, because i'm just rashee* i give you what you need
, wipping niggas up at the break next week
, l get your Heart and I'd never wanna
, Feel you like “drama” or
, Gee cause my rhyme is the key
, Open up your mind and pass in the energy
, To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3
, I make DO with the RE and MI
, Shine, on your mind, get busy one time
, Let the girls know that you're good to go

River of life to my soul
Anchor of peace that I know

You're the reason I live, the love I can give
With You I can do mighty things
Soaring upon angel wings
Touch my world with all that You are
And shine like the stars
CHORUS:
Give me faith to move those mountains
Give me hope when times are hard
Give me love to conquer all
Give me You to fill my heart
Lord, keep me hungry for You
Thirsty for more of the truth
Hear my prayer
May no compromise be in my life
CHORUS
Keeper of all of my dreams
You do impossible things
May no compromise be in my life

Verse 1
Spent all of my life breakin’ all the rules,
Steppin’ outta line in the streets and my school.
Can’t get enough of a good time,
Gonna live it up while I’m still alive.
Pre-chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,
Full speed ahead til I’m dead in the fast lane.
Live wire, wild fire,
I run a band where I bet I won’t fade away
Chorus
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
Verse 2
The devil may care, but I don’t give a damn,
To hell with reason, it’s all the scare.
You got the taste, I got the booze,
Life’s a vacation when there’s nothing to lose.
Pre-Chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,
Full speed ahead til I’m dead in the fast lane.
Live wire, wild fire,
I run a band where I bet I won’t fade away
Chrosu
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
Oh yeah, blow the red lights, sleep when I die,
Don’t you ever tell me to stop,
Chorus
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
(Guitar Solo)
Pre-Chorus
I’m a hell-raiser, risk-taker,
Full speed ahead til I’m dead in the fast lane.
Live wire, wild fire,
I run a band where I bet I won’t fade away
Chorus
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
You gotta live it up (You gotta live it up)
I’m a hell-raiser!
Oh yeah, blow the red lights, sleep when I die,
Don’t you ever tell me to stop,
You gotta live it up!

,When this began
,I had nothing to say
,And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
,I was confused
,And I let it all out to find
,That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
,Inside of me
,but all that they can see the words revealed
,Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
,Nothing to lose
,Just stuck, hollow and alone
,And the fault is my own
,And the fault is my own
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,What I thought was never real
,I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
,Erase all the pain till it's gone
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,Like I'm close to something real
,I wanna find something I wanted all along
,Somewhere I belong
,
,And I've got nothing to say
,I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
,I was confused
,Looking everywhere only to find
,That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
,So what am I?
,What do I have but negativity?
,Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
,Nothing to lose
,Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
,And the fault is my own
,And the fault is my own
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,What I thought was never real
,I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
,Erase all the pain till it's gone
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,Like I'm close to something real
,I wanna find something I wanted all along
,Somewhere I belong
,I will never know myself
,until I do this on my own
,And I will never feel
,anything else until my wounds are healed
,I will never be
,anything till I break away from me
,I will break away,
,I'll find myself today
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,What I thought was never real
,I wanna let go of the pain I felt so long
,(Erase all the pain till it's gone)
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel
,Like I'm close to something real
,I wanna find something I wanted all along
,Somewhere I belong
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
,Somewhere I belong
,I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
,Somewhere I belong
,Somewhere I belong
,Yeah
,Y'all know what it is
,Sometimes you gotta push
,Though all your obstacles
,Nah mean
,No matter what the options are
,There is no lose, there is no fail
,LET'S GO
,Seems like life go lightning speed
,slow it on down tell baby, just to breathe
,It's cold outside adjust your sleeve
,got here late, like just to leave
,Wings on my shirt a and cannot fly
,Asked do I love her, but I cannot lie
,Open up the door I cannot ride
,Heart made of stone and I cannot cry
,Hand on the glass I can feel the rain
,You don't want to fight and I feel your pain
,But I gotta go hard, gotta go far

,I talk to absolutely no one.
,Couldn't keep to myself enough.
,And the things bottled inside have finally begun
,to create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up.
,I heard the reverberating footsteps
,sinking up to the beating of my heart,
,and I was positive that unless I got myself together,
,I would watch me fall apart.
,And I can't  let that happen again

,You come to me with your scars on your wrist
,You tell me this will be the last night feeling like this
,
,I just came to say goodbye
,
,I didn't want you to see me cry, I'm fine
,
,But I know it's a lie
,This is the last night you'll spend alone
,
,Look me in the eyes so I know you know
,I'm everywhere you want me to be
,
,The last night you'll spend alone
,
,I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
,I'm everything You need me to be
,
,Your parents say everything is your fault
,But they don't know you like I know you they don't know you at all
,I'm so sick of when they say
,It's just a phase, you'll be ok. you're fine
,
,But I know it's a lie
,This is the last night you'll spend alone
,Look me in the eyes so I know you know

,The last night you'll spend alone
,
,I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
,I'm everything You need me to be
,The last night away from me
,
,The night is so long when everything's wrong
,If you give me a hand
,I will help you hold on
,Tonight
,
,Tonight
,
,This is the last night you'll spend alone

,
,If you could feel the end of the line,
,What are going to do ?
,Run away of hide behind
,the wall,If could know the truth
,What are going to do ?
,You'll turn your back on it and
,Cry over like this
,"I don't wanna hear it now"
,"I don't wanna hear it "
,"I don't wanna hear it,
,No, no, no"
,"I don't wanna hear it now"
,"I don't wanna hear it "
,"I don't wanna hear it,
,No, no, no"
,
,I'm not going to explain it again
,Like minister's damn refrain
,You must know the truth is in your eyes
,You're not hypnotized yet
,Did you find someone who tells you when it's over
,It's not like you Ms. Sober
,Why do ya crying like a little girl
,Tell me how do you feel it 'cuz
,I don't wanna feel it now
,I don't wanna feel it

,I don't wanna feel it
,I don't wanna feel it

,I'm dreaming of you every single day
,I wish I could turn off you
,I don't wanna hear it now
,I don't wanna hear it
,I don't wanna hear it,
,No, no, no
,I don't want your love and i
,don't want your call and i
,don't want to hear your crying
,No, no, no
,
,
,Just like a needle in a haystack
,another day when we run with the wolf pack
,everybody wants a piece when you know how
,you don't want to be on this side of know how
,when you see the horizon fading
,and the bright lights all start changing
,when your fate pulls up in a flat black phaeton
,
,you don't want to leave them waiting
,cause they'll hook you up, they'll watch you drown
,they've got us a picked for a life in the ground
,they build the walls that house the sharks
,
,they sell us torches and their the ones who makes it dark
,When this life tries to break us and beat us down
,they send the beast just to push us around
,
,we might exist with one foot in the grave
,this life aint over we still got something to save
,Redemption （oooh）
,
,Redemption （oooh）
,Maybe two wrongs don't make it right
,you don't want to bring a knife to a gun fight
,you don't want to realize what they write down
,you don't want to be around in the dog pound
,when the chains not far from breaking
,and the hand that feeds is taking
,get you fist wrapped up and you got locked up
,and the statements got you lying on the pavement
,
,cause they'll hook you up, they'll watch you drown
,they've got us a picked for a life in the ground
,they build the walls that house the sharks
,
,they sell us torches and their the ones who makes it dark
,When this life tries to break us and beat us down
,they send the beast just to push us around
,
,we might exist with one foot in the grave
,this life aint over we still got something to save
,Redemption （oooh）
,（oooh）Redemption
,The blood and the sweat
,you know where you at
,they took what you had
,now go take it back
,the blood and the sweat
,you know where you at
,they took what you had
,now go take it back
,
,When this life tries to break us and beat us down
,they send the beast just to push us around
,
,we might exist with one foot in the grave
,this life aint over we still got something to save
,Redemption （tries to break us and beat us down） （oooh）
,（try to break us and beat us down）
,Redemption （we still got something to save） （oooh）
,Redemption
,I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
,But no one would listen, cause no one else cared
,After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
,What am I leaving when I'm done here?
,So if you're asking me, I want you to know
,
,When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
,Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
,Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
,Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
,Leave out all the rest, don't be afraid
,I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
,I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
,I've never been perfect, but neither have you
,So if you're asking me, I want you to know
,When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
,Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
,Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
,Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
,Leave out all the rest
,Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
,
,Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
,
,I can't be who you are
,When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
,Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
,Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
,Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
,Leave out all the rest
,Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
,
,Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
,
,I can't be who you are
,I can't be who you are
,
I was an idiot in utero
Somehow missed New Mexico
Fell to earth in Baltimore I know
Now they lay case in empty rooms
Birthday cards and red balloons
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I invited Johnny Legs and Jackie-O
Empty parties filled with people I don't know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Telling lies and taking shots
Getting laid in parking lots
Getting high and getting caught, I know
All my broken paper planes
Parachutes and window panes
I'm a shooting star gone novocaine, I know
So I write to all the girly magazines
Splash my passion on the pages in between
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I'm fading out in stereo
I don't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
Rising from the afterglow
A dodo bird with polio
And me, I know, I know, I know, I know
I play with a rock and roll band on a subway
It keeps me far away from the gamma rays
We lit between the boom boom crash and the fade away,
I know
Oh co-come on wake up the congregation
We will see the light tonight
The spark the flash the bang the bite
I know, I know, I know I know know know know know know
I am rich and in the radio
I dream on my TV
Dislocation, dislocation
I could fade away in stereo
And you won't remember me
Dislocation, dislocation
If they dropped a bomb on London
Swallow LA with the sea
Dislocation, dislocation
Say a prayer for Oklahoma
Say another one for me
Dislocation, dislocation

,I Won't Run Away
,I don't wanna fall and throw it all away
,I don't wanna burn through another day
,I'll been searching for a better way
,And I'll keep fighting until it's over
,I'm not running away
,when everything is falling down around me
,Take me to the place I found You
,I'm so lost without You
,I'll be here as long as it takes
,I won't run away
,I don't wanna fade and drift away
,I don't wanna drown underneath the weight
,I can feel You
,everytime I break
,And I'm still fighting
,cause it's not over
,I'm not running away
,when everything is falling down around me
,Take me to the place I found You
,I'm so lost without You
,I'll be here as long as it takes
,I won't run away
,This world's so lonely
,You're my only
,hope to break away

,when everything is falling down around me
,Take me to the place I found You
,I'm so lost without You
,I'll be here as long as it takes

,I'm just the boy inside the man
,not exactly who you think I am
,trying to trace my steps back here again
,so many times
,I'm just the speck inside your hand
,You came and made who I am
,I remember where it all began
,so clearly
,I feel a million miles away
,still you connect me in your way
,and you created me
,something I would of never seen
,When I could only see the floor
,you made my window a door
,so when they say they don't believe
,I hope they see you in me
,After all the lights go down
,I'm just the words, you are the sound
,A strange type of chemistry
,You become a part of me
,and when I sit alone at night
,your thoughts run through me like a fire
,your the only one who knows
,who I really am
,We all wanna be somebody
,We just need a taste of who we are
,We all wanna be somebody
,We're willing to go but not that far
,We're all see through just like glass
,and we can shadder just as fast
,that light's been burned out for awhile
,I still see it every time I pass
,It was lost in the corners of my mind
,But I had a box of reasons why
,I never doubted it was there
,It just took a little time to find
,and
,I feel a million miles away
,still you connect me in your way
,and you created me
,something I would of never seen
,When I could only see the floor
,you made my window a door
,so when they say they don't believe
,I hope that they see you and me

,so when they say they don't believe
,I hope that they see you and me
,
,Hold your breath' take a step it's gonna be your day
,They're asking you to speak the truth but you don't know what to say
,
,Feel the fear creeping up like you were on a stage
,You've had enough you're stepping up to say what you came to say
,Say it just say it just say it
,
,Say it just say it just say it
,It's in my heart' it's in my soul' it's something that I can't let go

,Scared to let the world see my failures
,who I am or who I've been
,I've been waiting for somebody else to
,Take the chance that I am so afraid to
,I don't know how to find myself
,am I the only one the only one
,Oh I wanna feel You move me
,like a river running through me
,I am so tired of trying to prove
,it I'm never gonna do it alone
,God I need You to be my identity

,Camouflage that keeps our hearts so guarded
,But there's no shame

,like a river running through me
,I am so tired of trying to prove

,My Identity
,The Rasmus---Justify
,
,
,So close, so far
,I'm lost in time
,Ready to follow a sign
,If there was only a sign
,The last goodbye burns in my mind
,Why did I leave you behind?
,Guess it was too hard to climb
,
,Give me a reason
,Why would you want me to live and die
,Living a lie
,You were the answer
,All that I needed to justify
,Justify my life
,
,Someone as beautiful as you
,Could do much better it's true
,That didn't matter to you
,I tried so hard to be the one
,It's something I couldn't do
,Guess I was under the gun
,
,Give me a reason
,Why would you want me to live and die
,Living a lie
,You were the answer
,All that I needed to justify
,Justify my life
,
,It's only right
,That I should go
,And find myself
,Before I go and ruin someone else
,
,So close, so far
,I'm lost in time
,Ready to follow a sign
,If there was only a sign
,
,Give me a reason
,Why would you want me to live and die
,Living a lie

,
,It's only right
,That I should go
,And find myself
,Before I go and ruïn someone else
,
,So this is the end of you and me
,We had a good run and I'm setting you free
,To do as you want, to do as you please
,Without me
,Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea?
,Together we'd float so delicately
,But that was back when we could talk about anything
,
,'Cause I don't know who I am
,When you're running circles in my head
,And I don't know just who you are
,When you're sleeping in someone else's bed
,Three whole words and eight letters late
,And that would have worked on me yesterday
,We're not the same, I wish that could change
,But it can't
,
,And I'll say your name and in the same breath
,
,I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
,

,Another stop sign
,another headline
,another broken song
,Learning the labels
,lessons and fables I forgot
,Under the surface
,lost in the verses there is a rising tide
,And we're trying to rescue the meaning
,if only for tonight
,In between the lines and the boulevards
,Underneath the sky chasing who we are
,Wanting more before it slips away
,Screaming to the stars just to feel alive
,Maybe one more chance
,and we'll get it right
,I won't believe that all these days
,And all these dreams were only meant to fade
,meant to fade
,Zero to sixty
,running on empty
,tell me what have we become
,Haunted by secrets
,shadows and demons hide the sun
,But out of the darkness don't care
,what they call this
,I won't let you down this time yeah
,In between the lines and the boulevards
,Underneath the sky chasing who we are
,Wanting more before it slips away
,Screaming to the stars just to feel alive
,Maybe one more chance
,and we'll get it right
,I won't believe
,that all these days
,And all these dreams were only meant to fade
,In between the lines and underneath the sky
,Only meant to fade
,Screaming at the stars just to feel alive
,just to feel alive
,We're trying to rescue the meaning
,To do more than just survive
,And we're dying to capture the feeling
,If only for tonight
,In between the lines and the boulevards
,Underneath the sky chasing who we are
,Wanting more before it slips away
,Screaming to the stars
,just to feel alive
,Maybe one more chance
,and we'll get it right
,I won't believe
,that all these days
,And all these dreams were only meant to fade

,我一定会呵护着你也逗你笑
,你对我有多重要我后悔没让你知道
,安静的听你撒娇看你睡著一直到老
,就是开不了口让她知道
,就是那么简单几句我办不到
,整颗心悬在半空我只能够远远看着
,这些我都做得到但那个人已经不是我

,夜越黑梦违背
,难追难回味
,我的世界将被摧毁
,也许事与愿违

,单影无人相依偎
,夜越黑梦违背
,有谁肯安慰
,我的世界将被摧毁
,也许颓废也是另一种美

,该不该搁下重重的壳
,寻找到底哪里有蓝天
,随着轻轻的风轻轻的飘
,历经的伤都不感觉疼
,我要一步一步往上爬
,等待阳光静静看着它的脸
,小小的天 有大大的梦想
,重重的壳裹着轻轻的仰望
,我要一步一步往上爬
,在最高点乘着叶片往前飞
,小小的天 留过的泪和汗
,总有一天我有属于我的天
,我要一步一步往上爬
,在最高点乘着叶片往前飞

,一盏黄黄旧旧的灯 时间在旁闷不吭声
,寂寞下手毫无分寸 不懂得轻重之分
,沉默支撑跃过陌生 静静看着凌晨黄昏
,你的身影 失去平衡 慢慢下沉
,黑暗已在空中盘旋
,该往哪我看不见
,也许爱在梦的另一端
,无法存活在真实的空间
,想回到过去 试着抱你在怀里
,羞怯的脸带有一点稚气
,想看你看的世界 想在你梦的画面
,只要靠在一起就能感觉甜蜜
,想回到过去 试着让故事继续
,至少不再让你离我而去
,分散时间的注意 这次会抱得更紧
,这样挽留不知还来不来得及
,想回到过去
,思绪不断阻挡着回忆播放
,盲目的追寻仍然空空荡荡
,灰濛濛的夜晚睡意又不知躲到哪去
,一转身孤单已躺在身旁

,watch as the room rocks
,mentally moonwalk
,mixed media slang banging in your boombox
,verbal violence
,lyrical stylist
,in a time when rock/hip-hop rhymes are childish
,you can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
,rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an emcee
,with your lack of skill and facility you're killing me
,and a DJ in the group just for credibility
,i heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
,you're not an emcee if someone else writes your lines
,rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
,cuz rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
,but now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
,all after a fast buck
,and all the tracks suck
,so how does it stack up
,none of its real
,you wanna be an emcee
,you gotta study the skill
,who can rock a rhyme like this
,bring it to you every time like this
,who can rock a rhyme like this
,step step up step step up
,so you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
,but mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
,with a tendency to make up stories
,it sounded like the only hip-hop you've heard is top-40
,and your record company's completely missed it
,and all the kids are dissin' it for not being legitimate
,so in a battle you can't hack it
,react with whack shit and get smacked with verbal backflips
,get your ass kicked i'm a fabulous battle catalyst
,it's taken decades for emcees to establish this
,you're new to hip-hop and welcome if you're serious
,but not on a mike leave that to the experienced
,（using waves of sound the true master paralyzes his opponent
,leaving him vulnerable to attack）

,when this began
,i had nothing to say
,and i'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
,i was confused
,and i let it all out to find that i'm
,not the only person with these things in mind
,inside of me
,but all the vacancy the words revealed
,is the only real thing that i've got left to feel
,nothing to lose
,just stuck hollow and alone
,and the fault is my own
,and the fault is my own
,i want to heal
,i want to feel
,what i thought was never real
,i want to let go of the pain i've held so long
,erase all the pain 'til it's gone
,i want to heal
,i want to feel
,like I'm closing to something real
,i want to find something i've wanted all along
,somewhere i belong
,and i've got nothing to say
,i can't believe i didn't fall right down on my face
,i was confused
,looking everywhere only to find that it's
,not the way i had imagined it all in my mind
,so what am i
,what do i have but negativity
,cause i can't justify the
,way everyone is looking at me
,nothing to lose
,nothing to gain hollow and alone

,Why does it feel like night today?
,Something in here's not right today…
,Why am I so uptight today?
,Paranoia's all I got left
,I don't know what stressed me first
,Or how the pressure was fed
,But I know just what it feels like
,To have a voice in the back of my head
,It's like a face that I hold inside
,A face that awakes when I close my eyes
,A face watches every time I lie
,A face that laughs every time I fall
,(And watches everything)
,So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
,That the face inside is hearing me
,right beneath my skin
,It's like I'm, paranoid lookin' over my back
,It's like a, whirlwind inside of my head
,It's like I, can't stop what I'm hearing within
,It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
,I know I've got a face in me
,points out all the mistakes to me
,You've got a face on the inside too and
,Your paranoia's probably worse
,I don't know what set me off first
,but I know what I can't stand
,Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
,I can't add up to what you can but
,Everybody has a face that they hold inside
,A face that awakes when they close their eyes
,A face watches every time they lie
,A face that laughs every time they fall
,(And watches everything)
,So you know that when it's time to sink or swim

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life
My pride is broken

,
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You want to share what you have been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life
My pride is broken

,It's so unreal

,Watch the time go right out the window
,Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
,Wasted it all just to watch you go
,I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
,
,What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
,
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter

,In spite of the way you were mocking me
,Acting like I was part of your property
,Remembering all the times you fought with me
,I'm surprised it got so (far)
,Things aren't the way they were before
,You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
,Not that you knew me back then
,But it all comes back to me (in the end)

,Waiting alone I can not exist
,Feeling this hate I have never missed
,Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face

,It goes a one, two, three.
,was born
,I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
,Original style like an 808 drum, so I don't run the track.
,No, I make the track run.
,My mama taught me words, my dad, he built rockets.
,I put 'em both together now, tell me what I got.
,It's a pretty smart weapon:
,I can shoot it, I can drop it.
, learn to respect it cause you clearly can't stop it like that.
,Yea, cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right.
,And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite.
,It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right.
,Cause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights.
,Except for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
,and you can run your mouth or you could try to fill my shoes.
,But sweaty little solider, I ain't standing next to you.
,I'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view.
,Like that.
,Give me the strength of the rising sun.
,Give me the truth of the words I've sung.
,And when the large bells ring the poor men sing
,"Bring me to kingdom come"
,This is something for your people on the block to/ back down and rock to
,Give you whatcha need like Papa/Who shot ya
,Separate the weak from the obscure, lead your meek, I creep hard on imposters
,Switch styles on the dime/Quick witted ya'll/Quit tripping
,I don't have time for your crying
,I grind tough so can you make your mind up,
,Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
,Bang bang/Little monkey man playing

,I'm just saying / You ain't gotta sliver of a chance
,I get ill or I deliver/While you quiver in your pants,
,So shake shake down/Money, here's the break down
,You can play the bank/I'ma play the bank take down
,And no mistakes now/I'm coming to getcha
,I'm a Banksy/You're a Brainwash, get the picture?/

,So rest your head, it's time to sleep and dream of what's in store.
,The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more.
,Cause time has torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more...
,In this farewell'
,there's no blood'
,there's no alibi.
,Cause I've drawn regret'
,from the truth'
,of a thousand lies.

,I am a little bit of loneliness

,I am what I want you to want
,What I want you to feel
,But its like no matter what I do
,I can\'t convince you
,To just believe this is real
,So I let go of watching you
,Turn your back like you always do
,Face away and pretend that I\'m not
,But I\'ll be here cause your all that I\'ve got
,I can\'t feel the way I did before
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,Time won\'t tell
,There\'s damage anymore
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,I am a little bit insecure
,A little unconfident
,Cause you don\'t understand
,I do what I can
,But sometimes I don\'t make sense
,What you never want to say
,But I\'ve never had a doubt
,It\'s like no matter what I do
,I can\'t convince you
,For once just to hear me out
,So I let go of watching you
,Turn your back like you always do
,Face away and pretend that I\'m not
,But I\'ll be here cause your all that I\'ve got
,I can\'t feel the way I did before
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,Time won\'t heal
,There\'s damage anymore
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored
,Now!
,Hear me out now
,Your gonna listen to me like it or not
,Right now!
,Hear me out now
,Your gonna listen to me like it or not
,Right now..
,I can\'t feel
,The way I did before
,Don\'t turn your back on me
,I won\'t be ignored!!

,It starts with
,One, it multiplies until you can taste the sun
,And burn by the sky
,You try to take it from
,But if it falls
,There's no place to run
,Crumbling down, it's
,(So unreal)
,They're dealing you in
,To the term and your end
,And sending you back again
,To places you've been
,And bending your will
,Until it breaks you within

,Through the skylight
,End the highlights
,On a frame of steel
,See the brightness
,Of your likeness
,As I write this
,On a path through
,(The way I feel)
,Hear the screaming
,Am I dreaming
,As it's seeming
,That you've played your part
,Like you're heartless

酷玩乐团Coldplay英国金榜冠军曲〈Paradise〉与Top 10单曲〈Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall〉混音版由DJ杂志2011年百大DJ票选名单中分别位居第12名、第23名、第26名的Axell、Steve Angello、Sebastian Ingrosso三大DJ合体组成的瑞典超级电音劲旅「瑞典浩室黑手党Swedish House Mafia」气势如虹，联手冲上DJ杂志2011年百大DJ票选第10名，不过，这支超级电音劲旅却在2012年9月底宣布将在11月起跑，造访杜拜、印度、瑞典、德国、法国、俄罗斯、南非与美国旧金山、芝加哥、纽约、洛杉矶的「One Last Tour电音之旅」结束后回归各自的DJ岗位，消息一出，引爆抢票狂潮，就连首度开放DJ秀演出的纽约麦迪逊花园广场的门票都在开卖八分钟之内横扫一空。Swedish House Mafia在「One Last Tour电音之旅」启动前夕发行欢声雷动的电音／浩室大碟《Until Now》，首波与瑞典创作型歌手John Martin合作的造势单曲〈Don`t You Worry Child〉在2012年10月发行首周空降英国流行金榜与舞曲金榜双冠军，同时挺进全美舞曲榜第五名以及瑞典（冠军）、比利时（冠军）、苏格兰（冠军）、丹麦（亚军）、爱尔兰（亚军）、荷兰（#5）、意大利（#9）、加拿大（#10）等国流行单曲榜Top 10，音乐录像带在YouTube累积高达1330万浏览人次。Swedish House Mafia在2010年夏季以电音浩室舞曲〈One〉撼动全球舞池，挺进包括英国流行金榜第7名与全美舞曲榜第三名在内的全球11国流行单曲榜Top 10，瞬间成为舞池派对潮流中象征新世代年轻精神指标的国歌。Steve Angello与Sebastian Ingrosso在六、七岁的时候就在Sebastian父亲创立的Plumphouse唱片公司玩音乐，一起弄休闲音乐合辑，或是帮表演节目创作音乐，甚至帮瑞典主办的欧洲歌唱大赛谱写歌曲，Steve与Sebastian在2000年认识隶属于浩室音乐厂牌Sulphuric旗下的Axell，这群热爱电音与浩室舞曲的朋友一边在夜店进行电音秀，一边发表混音作品，Steve与Axell在2006年携手以Supermode之名发表取样1980年代中期的英国流行乐团Bronski Beat歌曲〈Smalltown Boy〉、〈Why?〉而成的电子舞曲〈Tell Me Why〉，Steve随后又与Sebastian以代号Buy Now发表了无数作品。Steve，Sebastian与Axell欢喜逗阵的电音旅程所释放的动能逐渐壮大，三人索性在2008年以乐迷在网络论坛上的称呼Swedish House Mafia组成浩室/电音共同体，三位DJ各自展现不同的电音风格—Steve偏向地下电子乐节奏，Axell注重电子舞曲旋律性，Sebastian象是介于两人之间的电子乐平衡木，Swedish House Mafia在2010年大放异彩，接连以〈One〉、〈Miami 2 Ibiza〉等单曲闯进英国流行金榜与全美舞曲榜TOP 10，首张专辑《Until One》也进驻英国流行金榜亚军。2012年压轴大碟《Until Now》汇聚超强电音／浩室节奏能量，有空降英国流行金榜冠军大作〈Don`t You Worry Child〉；2012年葛莱美奖最佳舞曲提名之全美舞曲榜冠军曲〈Save The World〉；与澳洲电音双人组Knife Party联手擒拿英国舞曲金榜亚军曲〈Antidote〉；取样奥斯卡电影音乐得主汉斯季默（Hans Zimmer）为电影【全面启动】所谱写的主题音乐〈Time〉而成的全美舞曲榜第三名畅销曲〈Greyhound〉；与葛莱美奖乐团OneRepublic主唱Ryan Tedder合作的英国舞曲金榜第四名畅销曲〈Calling〉。专辑中同时辑录Swedish House Mafia 操盘制作英伦摇滚名团酷玩乐团Coldplay英国金榜冠军曲〈Paradise〉与第六名单曲〈Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall〉混音版，以及英伦华丽流行乐团Florence + The Machine晋升英国金榜第五名单曲〈You Got The Love〉混音版。

, 作词 : Frey, Henley
,She came from Providence
,The one in Rhode Island
,Where the old world shadows hang
,Heavy in the air
,She packed her hopes and dreams
,Like a refugee
,Just as her father came across the sea
,She heard about a place people were smiling
,They spoke about the red man's way
,And how they loved the land
,And they came from everywhere
,To the Great Divide
,Seeking a place to stand
,Or a place to hide
,Down in the crowded bars
,Out for a good time
,Can't wait to tell you all
,What it's like up there
,And they called it paradise
,I don't know why
,Somebody laid the mountains low
,While the town got high
,Then the chilly winds blew down
,Across the desert
,Through the canyons of the coast,
,To the Malibu
,Where the pretty people play,
,Hungry for power
,To light their neon way
,And give them things to do
,Some rich men came and raped the land,
,Nobody caught them
,Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus,
,People bought them
,And they called it paradise
,The place to be
,They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea
,You can leave it all behind
,And sail to Lahaina
,Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
,They even brought a neon sign:"Jesus is coming"
,Brought the white man's burden down
,Brought the white man's reign
,Who will provide the grand design?
,What is yours and what is mine?
,Cause there is no more new frontier
,We have got to make it here
,We satifsy our endless needs
,And justify our bloody deeds,
,In the name of destiny
,And the name of God
,And you can see them there,
,On Sunday morning
,Stand up and sing about
,What it's like up there
,They call it paradise
,I don't know why
,You call someplace paradise,
,Kiss it goodbye
,
,Don't call me up
,I won't answer this time
,You've had your chances
,And you blew them all so fine
,No, I won't regret it
,I won't take this load on me
,I try, try to forget it
,Yes, I'm already on my way
,The higher they fly
,The harder they fall
,I've been waiting for this moment to come
,I played all my cards
,The stake was on you
,Now there ain't a single reason to stay
,And wait for your call
,You know I'm done, I give up
,I'm afraid that I could lose again
,But hey, it's not an illusion
,That's just the price I've got to pay, yeah
,The higher they fly

,And how I Wish to know what love is like
,To find someone to contemplate
,There's a voice and a million answers
,To the questions I don't ask a demon-I've got to contain
,When I'm walking through the fen
,Gonna deep into the black
,There are whispers that I can't restrain
,Don't give in
,Rise to fame
,Time will come
,Make your claim
,Time has come
,For the crow who fly away
,So you're an angel meant to walk down here
,And you believe it's all divine
,And you don't play by all those temporal rules
,Watch the world begin to die
,Alright-when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
,I've been crashing from the sky
,Fallen to care for the pray
,They put a spoke right in your wheel

,Oh,you burn your feet n unholy ground
,You roam the barren wicked plains abound
,In evil eyes and evil speak
,About it all your evil freaks
,When you say it's all divine and meant to be
,What about your flesh and blood and defire like me?
,Their evil eyes are looking down on you
,And those who don't are losing sight of you
,Face the rage to chase away
,The specter of disgrace and shame
,Withered roses dying on the ledge
,A withered dreamer standing on the edge
,You dream of love but you wake up to pain
,You're better off to join in my game
,Then she'll better off to cry contrite tears
,One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
,Rise to fame
,(your time has come)
,Time will come
,(to take the sun)
,Make your claim-you're drawn to the sound
,Time has come-you're leaving ground
,Rise to fame-the flight of the crow

,Unlike some which are too deep to see
,Like scars in the Nomads soul
,Their mending is so slow
,Not a shout of a hundred enemies
,Can make him feel fear inside him
,But when sunsets and the cold arrives
,With crushing solitude in the darkness of night
,He will ride across land and time
,To find a way through this endless night
,There s a storm in his heart
,And the fire burns his soul
,But the wanderers part is to ride alone
,With bare hands he has taken many lives
,He has had a hundred women by his side
,From enchanted woods to the freezing North
,He is known at every sea and far beyond
,As the moon grows and the circle is complete
,He lies down and waits for sleep
,But there's always a scenery in his mind.
,Of all that beauty he once left behind
,He will ride across land and time
,To find a way through this endless night

,Und man schlägt die Nägel ein
,"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun"
,Und immer leiser wird sein Schrein
,Die Sonne treibt sein Schweiß
,Er friert,doch ist ihm heiss
,langsam schlägt sein Herz
,Es mildert seinen Schmerz
,Außer ihm,alles lacht
,Bevor er fällt in die Ohnmacht

Just because I hate the female race.
There's no remorse.

Religion is a futile attempt to abstain from loosing your mind.
There's no remorse in my eyes.

For some men,
The power to destroy a life
Becomes a quest for dominance.

Where your self-defense ends.

Your life amounts to nothing.

All the Blood from the bodies collects then irrigates through the
soil. It flows through the cracks of the earth then drips to the
demons below, just waiting to be unleashed by the blood of the chosen
Christ. His blood shall set them free. Beneath this sacred ground lies
the gate to their dimension, amidst the molten bowls of the earth.
Once the chosen blood touches to their lips the gates open; our
dimensions amalgamate, transporting them to earth to rule with me
forever. Without the chains of their translucency my flesh burns away
to reveal my true form as God. I am Belial; the serpent has shed his
skin. I have deceived the world as a servant of God. With the church I
have prepared my own thrown. It was easy to fool them all with my
disguise. As they looked into my eyes they never saw the serpent
beneath the surface, waiting for his moment to strike. I have brought
forth hell to earth just to show God what it’s worth. His kingdom
shall rot forever. I have no sympathy for God.

,But now I see things different.

,You need to fail faster to allow you to beat this.
,What a ritual, what a script to unfold
,The story you were told
,Fingernails scratching words on the chalkboard,
,Gave me chills, hair stood up on my forearm
,The white noise was so hard to pick through,
,But I was still there to catch you
,Pick you up before your short fuse would get you.
,You told me that I would see you again,
,Whether in this life or through a future kin
,If I could have only one wish, I would ask to be stronger...stronger.
,Stronger

,This program kept you breathing, it kept you alive

,Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
,Only murmurs collapse from its scream
,Entombment of a machine
,But I saw it die.
,But I saw it die
,But I saw It dead.
,But I saw it die.
,I saw it die
,I watched it DIE!

  I will not relent no, no
 Never live with defeat never falter
 This like the air that I breathe
 I will not choke on failure
 
 I am a mortal man
 But I'm not fallen
 I'm not broken
 I am a mortal man But I'll
 Hold tight to my beliefs
 
 I have suffered defeat, pain, loss
 Still I push to the edge, never falter
 For this cement my beliefs
 I'll will not choke on failure
 
 I will not relent

,Endlich weis ich wo ich bin
,Und so blicke ich zurück auf jene Menschen die ich damals kannt
,auf jene mit denen ich durch das Leben streifte Hand in Hand
,Zu sehen das ich die Welt verändert' als ich eins ins Jenseits stieg
,Zeit das ich mein Leben lebte und dies allein macht mich Antik
,Den Sinn in meinem Leben habe ich mir selbst gegeben
,und das bedeutet Krieg
,Dies macht mich Antik
,Hab es genossen Stück um Stück

,Menschen die mich einst verließen oder die mich damals hassten
,Es mir schwerer machten, sich mit meinem Leben nie befassten
,Auch wenn sie es mir nicht glauben wollen ich bedanke mich
,denn nur durch ihren Hass und neid bin ich jetzt unsterblic
,Menschen lieben dich wenn du deine Sache hast gut gemacht
,Doch machst du deine Sache richtig bist du gottlos und verhasst
,Der Tod ist der zeitlose Frieden und das leben ist der Krieg
,Nur wenn du diese Schlacht gewinnst bist auch du Antik

Children of Anu.
A son born of Tiamat and Apsu
His mother’s dissected corpse carefully arranged to create the universe.
Marduk, patron God of Babylon.
Marduk is aging.
A city in decline.
Anu Impregnates the Earth.
Birth seven Gods.
Decree their destinies to serve as the weapons of Erra.
The ruins of a city.
The vicious Sebitti.
Fear.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living things.
Fill their hearts with dragon’s venom.
Devastation to Marduk and Babylon.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates. Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
May they lay low living things.
The Igigi will glorify your name.
Mountain peaks bow their heads in terror.
The gods, your Fathers, praise your valor.
Kings kneel beneath your feet.
Countries bring you their tribute.
Demons flee.
Rolling seas hear and stir up.
People are frightened into controlling the noise.
Ishum lights the way through the darkened city streets.
His body illuminates.
Ignite like Gerra.
In the wake of Erra, they decimate.
Devastate a city in decline.
Devastate the city of the gods.
Children of Anu.
Lay low living the things.
The Igigi will glorify your Name.
The Gods, your Fathers, will praise your valor.

,will you remember me
,as the one from the trees
,when the forests used to sing
,or when i locked myself
,in the heart of the wood
,and threw away the key
,you just kept giving yourself away
,a gift to cherish until piece by piece
,you laid before the roots of time
,day by day the nights swallow the sun,
,and with every night
,the more you gave your sadness came undone
,you just kept slipping through the cracks
,of my fingertips
,i only hope that you remember me
,as the one from the trees
,when the forests used to sing
,instead of when i locked myself
,in the heart of the wood
,and threw away the key
,you're not desire
,you're just a fucking widow
,weaving webs among the woods
,i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
,i'll show you the world of the dead
,there you were smiling into the night
,i watched you sing for hours on end
,we're telltale spiders spinning webs and singing songs
,sharing your stories with the moon and the trees
,with a world which strung you along i've shut you out
,i don't like your stories anymore
,they always end so fucking sad
,fuck
,i've turned my back
,i've turned my back
,on you for good
,just keep smiling into the night
,i watched you pass me by
,every night you died
,with a smile on your face
,in my dreams you wept blood
,from your eyes
,just keep smiling into the night
,my beautiful bride
,just keep smiling into the night
,my beautiful bride
,i fell for your bleeding crimson eyes
,just so you, just so you know
,i'll always remember you
,as the telltale spider
,when darkness crept into our days
,sharing stories with the world
,until piece by piece you gave your heart away
,you're not desire
,you're just a fucking widow
,weaving webs among the woods
,i'm not the answer but if you take my hand
,i'll show you the world of the dead
,i hate sad stories they always end the same
,i'll never forget how the forests wept
,when you gave yourself away
,No longer on your side,
,No longer within your prison
,No longer here to speak with a positive spin on society
,So sick of your politics,
,so sick of your fading religions
,So sick of the endless lies that ignite and divide
,it's homicide
,This is the reason your walls are coming down
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Torch it all;
,Torch it all
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Watch it burn
,The writing's on the wall
,Watch it burn
,So tired of your ignorance,
,So tired of your passing trends
,So tired of your predictive script,
,You're all dead inside
,You're all dead inside
,It was supposed to be better than this
,Can you imagine why?
,The path of no return has killed all reason to believe
,A paradox in the vow you've taken.
,Engulfed in your own world
,The tried and true are now unspoken.
,God save you all
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Torch it all; Torch it all
,Did you even hear a word I said?
,Watch it burn
,The writing's on the wall.

Another day is slipping away from us.
Their kingdoms can? t outlast the hopelessness we know.
We? re barricaded in and we? re desperate.
Eternity will never claim me from my throne.
This is my last chance to pull out my teeth,
Pull out all my teeth from my own tongue.
As we push on... push on.
Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK.And now 
I see what kept us from making it.
We? re holding to these deadweight hearts as we all sink.
To me their human pride does not exist, (does not exist, does not exist)
To me their human pride does not exist at all.
This is my last chance to pull out my teeth,
Pull out all my teeth from my own tongue.
And what we had (PUSH ON) was always this (PUSH ON).
Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK...Aim for the whites of their eyes.
Aim for the whites of their eyes.
Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.The weakest hands have destroyed everything we worked for.
Aim for the whites of their 
EYES.The weakest hands have destroyed everything we worked for.
As we PUSH 
ON.As WE P
USH ON.Broke and relentless.
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath...and start making your mark.
Broke and relentless.start making your mark
Show them more heart than scars.
SHOW THEM 
MORE HEART 
THAN SCARS.
Never give in.
Stop holding your breath and start making your 
MARK...Push on.
Push on.
Hold your breath, baby. 
We have to make our hearts sit still. 
Hold your tongue, honey, 
The things we know could unleash hell. 
Patch me up, my skin is so tight around my chest, my heart is leaping out. 
I feel my imagination playing like a movie in my eyes, 
It’s got me firmly by the sleeve. 
Hold your breath baby, we have to make our hearts sit still. 
I swear they’re beating so loud that anyone could tell 
We’re keeping every thought to ourselves in case we mention how we feel. 
Hold your tongue honey, the things we know could unleash hell. 
I see your imagination shimmer in the way that you move, 
Hardly afraid that anyone could see. 
We’re caught up in the moment, it’s got us now, and you’ve got me by the collar. 
What are you waiting for? 
Pull me in. 
We saw the warning signs too late, and we’re too far gone. 
Please don’t remind me of reality now, 
I’ve been pretending for days by now, 
My god, it must have been days.
,
,It's your turn right now, let me see your steps
,Let me feel your hesitation
,Nothing ventured, nothing gained
,We know the reproach to yourself
,All your reflections as an open secret
,All your mistakes as a success
,Your tears as the pitiful disport
,Your decisions make us win
,Follow the guide we gave you
,Don't look upward, there's nothing above you
,Your eyes aren't qualified
,Your memory is your future
,Can you remember your end?
,We, we are your faith and your fear
,We are your inspiration and your overload
,You're all equal
,This is your reality, your veiled sight
,You can never see
,You can put the blame on us
,You can put the blame on us
,"It's all about your personal interpretation of what you're looking at."
,I see you try to grow with your scars
,But you fail again and again
,You can put the blame on us
,This is what, this is what we expect
,This makes your life so much easier
,Just close your eyes, follow blindly
,In your deepest dreams you can see us
,In your lonely hours you can feel us
,In your lonely hours you can feel us
,(You can feel us, you can feel us)
,This prison was built for you
,You are not ready for the outside
,Maybe you will never be
,Maybe you will never see
,Nothing is more constant than change
,
,So why, why don't you change within?
,Positions won't change
,As long as you can't see the point
,Till then we will keep observing you...

,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it

,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually

,泪水 浸湿了无奈
,
,爱 让它安静的离开
,懂爱的角色总会有替代
,眼睛睁开 寂寞会化作尘埃
,不如等 等另一个人来
,
,爱 让它安静的离开
,合起双手祈祷它的未来
,相信时间 能把过去都掩埋
,再去想 谁值得你去爱

,在海水退潮裸露的暗礁
,暴力结束这黑暗的破晓
,威胁着社会广角
,（这永不散退的迷雾）
,时间停滞在这一秒
,放慢脚步企图去寻找
,至烟头熄灭寂静的墙角
,（已再没法回头）
,Please stay away
,Hide in the dark
,Let the fire burn to the end
,Just leave me with despair
,You thought I cannot see
,The tear is dropping
,The way you live is torturing me
,Misery is bursting in

,逆行时空止不住绝望

,看构造万物暂停时间
,擅自闯入人品人性的恶劣
,攀比虚荣嫉妒与诬陷
,烈火在灼烧漆黑的双眼
,肆意地咆哮
,转身微笑头发长到嘴角
,闭上眼虔诚祷告
,（这愈演愈烈的恐怖）
,掉落碎片好似飞鸟
,狂风猛烈地撕扯着我
,马路中央谁在嘶哑尖叫

,We have both bared witness to the truth but our origins suggest otherwise
,Holding us down, for the other’s view is incessant
,Paving a way of disbelief that fractures the core
,And leaves us the opposition to the things that make us whole
,Our motion is relative…
,Bring me one step closer to feeling your pain, for I cannot replicate
,The process that has made you who you are today
,Would you do the same for me?
,Instead you seem to bind my words with something dispassionate
,As if all of this means nothing
,Filtering out everything
,An affinity for us to disagree
,Do you see the gravity?
,Go into another dimension to isolate yourself from the views
,Go into another dimension to isolate yourself from the views
,For the truth only resides in the eyes of your kind
,Even if the rest of the world were to wait for eternity
,To see the other side
,To see the other side of life, out of context from your predisposition
,You cannot believe what you see but the view is clear from here
,To see the other side of life, out of context from your predisposition
,You can not feel it when you get there

,Dreaming of all the big things,
,But can't you see it,
,You have to be asleep to believe it,
,Feeling, feeling so small,
,Under the night sky,
,Looking at stars,
,Waiting for them to fall
,If you had one moment,
,Moment to love, moment to breathe,
,How would you live it?
,See the world,
,Drown in the sea of tears,
,Feel the pain,
,Caused by the deepest fears,
,If you had one moment,
,moment to bleed, moment to give,
,how would you live it?
,Stay alive, in black and white,
,But try to feel the light,
,Seeing colors feeding your eyesight,
,Get out, join the life,
,Don't try to hide inside,
,Dark side of your restless mind.
,If you had one moment,
,Moment to love, moment to breathe,
,How would you live it?

Flashing eyes of heat
Vessel through the deep
By the son of night, unclean.
CharonFear becomes belief,
For those who cannot pay the fee.
A coin to board the fleet,
Or one hundred years disease
RowBut the line it never fades
The story is bound to unfold in the end
Love of mine, gone forever
Say goodbye to the sky
Bound by time, enter the ride
Absently, 
I will beMotivate fortune
Can't escape from the arms of death
Along the shore many faces accumulate
In preparation for the underworld
Single file ghost by ghost
The deck fills up to embark on the final sail
But the line it never fades
The story is bound to unfold in the end
Alone we rise and fall
Awaiting the day, a life coalesced.
Deep in the silence our fate is won
Create and consciously free the mind.
So far from where 
I lost my soul,
Depart, implore, divine.
In our minds adventure is always listening
Just stay here
The world isn't always listening
DisappearSuffer in endless doubt
Holding onto the memories as they fade away.
These thoughts and sorrows will not remain.
Writhing and embraced,retribution, soul eclipse turns solid,energized, sucking vomit - acting like its honey;deprived of 
I,Falling while thrusting squares through circles,serving one single new dimension.
Terror rising, agnostics nemesis, a prophet of extinction.
I scorch the skies before your very eyes,my deliverance - enslavement labelled: love.
Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction.
,Climb(You're dehydrated)
,Fly(Your wings are jaded)
,Cry(You're enervated)
,Die(For what you believe in)
,Try(You've nearly made it)
,Why?
,You're the plague within my dreams
,Soaring through an atmosphere of an adequate lack of strength
,And we're responsible
,The truth is that it will end here
,Denial's an impairment of your fear
,Can we save us from ourselves?
,Can we save us from ourselves?
,This is the saviour and its form
,You can break through
,Wake me up
,Tell me it's gone
,False hope sells lies I won't buy
,We are still one
,Let's attempt escape
,Melancholia will feed
,We'll admit defeat
,The vox popular will cease
,The air is thickening
,We are drifting
,You're the plague within my dreams
,Soaring through an atmosphere of an adequate lack of strength
,And we're responsible(And we're responsible)
,The truth is that it will end here
,Denial's an impairment of your fear
,Can we save us from ourselves?
,Can we save us from ourselves?
,This is the saviour and its form
,What's done is done
,One more second chance would be enough
,Only on the brink can we see so clearly

Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is just the way she speaks
We are all waiting for
Her to smile
Because when she cries
These are the days that we stay inside
And when she screams
She lights up the sky
If only we had listened to her oceans
We would have seen a change in tides
And now there's one thing left to say
As all these days seem to waste away
I'm sorry
I wish I could let you
Breathe
Exhale, all of the poison
That we have brought to this Earth
Exhale the, poison
We have brought to this Earth
Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is just the way she speaks
Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is only for today.

With the old days born anew
A Massive gathering of onlookers
Sending birds to shelter the shipwrecked
With feathers of dust and wind
Emerging from the fiery fields.
We're all being stepped on like insects
A million minds weeping
This boundless energy
This synergy
It's better contained.
We are so free
And what a superb absence is our soul
Desire is a liar
Blueprint of mankind's weakness.
Absolute absolution
Criticize criticism.
We are weighed down every moment
By the merciless sensation of time
This is an epidemy
Without remedy
It's better contained.
Evolve, so free
And what a superb absence is our soul
Resolve this mirroring, wondering
We believe in the signs.
Into the depths of the unknown
Only there you'll find something new.
What are you running from?
Obsession? What are you running from?
There are moments of existence
When time and space are more profound
And the awareness of existence
Is immensely heightened.
This is the war of creation
And time becomes a murderer
Murderer!
Bring me consolation
Then we'll talk
Inconsistent copy
Abductor of every art form
Eyes can't see what's beyond
And the wind's silent.
So from the mould
Scarlet and gold
A bulb will rise
A newborn
Bring him consolation
Then he'll bless us
Give him a Judas kiss and
Face the consequence
Eyes can't see what's beyond.
So long, my serenity
Lost in a conversation
Build these towers upside down
Lost in this constellation
And the wind is silent.

  我们在夹缝里生活
 一面是天　一面是地
 我的躯干受到了挤压
 我们只有吃力的呼吸
 
 我们在夹缝里生活
 上面是腐朽　下面是噪音
 我拼命地闭上双眼
 我使劲地捂住双耳
 
 我们在夹缝里生活
 纯粹的绿洲在我们心里
 别再浪费宝贵的时间
 生活已经太不容易
 
 我们在夹缝里生活
 左是你　右还是你
 我早就会讨厌你
 不会吻你　我藐视你....

Got a Black Magic Woman
Got a Black Magic Woman
I've got a Black Magic Woman
Got me so blind, I can't see
That she's a Black Magic Woman
Trying to make a Devil outta me
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby, no, no, no
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Stop messing 'round with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me, baby
You just might pick up my magic sticks, oh, no
Got your spell on me, baby
You got your spell on me, baby, ohh
You got your spell on me, baby
Turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, Magic Woman
I can't leave you alone, no, no

Weak Aside - No place for those
Our struggle leaves behind
Our lourd won't tolerate those
Whom through attrition fall
We must dominate!
With iron through our veins
And a will made so elite
Hunting for our daily bread
And the sinister close in sight
Hunger always drives the beast
And the women fall prey
We must dominate!
Leading all the wonderers to certain fate
Another victim reviled
I'm staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
Tell me who is going to save you now!
Animal senses ever alert
Praise Be to the father-war
As a servant I am serving myself
And I bathe in anticipation
Unless you taste it you could never know
All the power our lourd bestows
With a bow and a kiss profane
Be a victor or be a victim
Weak Aside - No place for those
Our struggle leaves behind
Our lourd won't tolerate those
Whom through attrition fall
We must dominate!
作词 : Dorrian, Jennings
Sliding down the mountain, as dusk passes to day. 
The antidote of elation, now lifeless masses wake. 
Jaws of suxiety open, the luring vampire of agility, 
a fatal invitation, sight hazing from me. 
Oh midnight mountain, I require, inner relocation, 
back to pinnacles high. 
Drowning in empty faces, sinking in banal, 
I crave the isolation of eventide when perception climbs, 
I just need the injection, a dose to boost my flight, 
a sonic blast of moonlight, nucleus ignites. 
Oh midnight mountain, now I'm revived, 
stimulus transcending, back to pinnacles high,
Screaming at doleful skies, absorbing all my sighs, 
responding to my cries, 
downcast a thunder of reprise, 
won't let the next sunrise, signal my landslide, 
from ecstatic highs, I'm on top of their demise.

Where you go, 
I see gold 
I am not worthy, 
Who am I
Under a stone, skin and bone
The children of fear are not alone
Rivers of tears, flesh and blood
An eye for an eye, that's all we've got
Time will be ending, life's a crusade
For a consciousness rising, out of desperate state
We've got the power, we've got the power
We've got the power, we've got the power
Power and truth, desire and trust
Like the wind and the rain, ashes and dust
Into light and the future, education is work
Into violent peace, that will conquer the world
We've got the power, we've got the power
We've got the power, we've got the power

Take a litle walk to the edge of town
Go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand
He'll wrap you in his arms,
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
Heal your shrinking soul
Hey buddy, you know you're
Never ever coming back
He's a god, he's a man,
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand
You ain't got no money?
He'll get you some
You ain't got no car? he'll get you one
You ain't got no self-respect,
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand
(organ solo)
You'll see him in your nightmares,
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
On the tv screen
And hey buddy, i'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand
(organ solo)
Extra verse from dj spooky remix (from scream 2 soundtrack):
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake
(grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't
Getting near much as he will take.
He's a...
He's mumbling words you can't understand
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.
,I have climbed the highest mountains

,Only to be with you
,But I still haven't found
,What I'm looking for
,But I still haven't found
,What I'm looking for
,I have kissed honey lips
,Felt the healing in her fingertips
,It burned like fire

,You loosened the chains
,You carried the cross
,And my shame
,And my shame

,Happy anniversary from the bottom of my credit card
,Who was that inside you?
,That made me feel so cock strong?
,I wish the truth could do to you
,What your snapchat put me through!
,Woman
,I make war to you
,If you give a fuck enough, you’ll make war too
,God damn, is this routine to you?
,Woman
,I’m so bored
,Of digging your trenches
,When all this time it was for your affection, that’s a lesson
,Sometimes you gotta leave that goddamned thing right where you lost it
,I don’t dig up the living corpses - I've seen your kids - I just caught them
,Woman
,I make war to you
,If you give a fuck enough, you’ll make war too
,God damn, is this routine to you?
,Woman
,Who was that inside you?
,That made me feel so gone?
,From your smiles to your core?
,All I see is love gone!
,From your smile to your core
,Get off the bed and out the door
,All I see
,All I see is love gone
,From your smile to your core
,Get off the bed and out the door
,All I see...
,All I see is love gone
,Woman
,I make war to you
,If you give a fuck enough
,You’ll make war too
,You’ll make war too
,You’ll make war too
,You’ll make war too

,I've been trying to find a way
,To repair the mess I've made
,So, I wrote a song for you.
,Every day seems the same to me.
,You walk away leaving nothing left to say.
,You make me feel like shit.
,I've been trying to find a way.
,To repair the mess I've made.
,So, I wrote a song for you.
,I can't be the way you want.
,Stop pushing.
,No, I can't stay no more.
,It's killing me.
,Don't wanna play your game.
,Don't wanna feel like this again.
,It's over.
,Now I see what you did to me.
,Made me believe there was something wrong with me
,You just screwed up my mind.
,I've been trying to find a way
,But I guess it is too late
,So, I'm gonna stop now
,I will be myself from now on.
,I will be myself.
,And I will never fall again.
,I can't be the way you want.
,Stop pushing.
,No, I can't stay no more.
,It's killing me.
,Don't wanna play your game.
,Don't wanna feel like this again.
,It's over
,It's over
,
,Another sunset falls, awaiting your return
,I wish upon a star, for what it's worth
,The sea can't wash away a brother's love
,I've got so much to say to you
,
,Waiting for all this time
,Enlightened by a starry sky
,Staring at ocean tides, I think of you
,
,Even though you're away, you're still there for me
,And I just wonder when you will be back again
,The sea can't wash away a brother's love
,I've still so much to say on my mind
,The distance between us ain't going to tear us apart
,And from the start, I've been here, I've been here
,
,Waiting for all this time
,Enlightened by a starry sky
,Staring at ocean tides, I think of you
,Waiting for all this time
,Enlightened by a starry sky
,Staring at ocean tides

,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,God help me, I've fallen away
,The leaves are dancing on my grave
,Streets are sounding low, we are ready now
,That our world has turned too slowly
,As sad as it sounds, will I miss them when I'm underground?
,Yeah son, it's okay, I'm on my way to a better place
,The walls are shaking
,The Earth is breaking
,Breaking apart while you're grieving
,This distance between us it always defeats us (it always defeats us, it always defeats us)
,Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,It's happened again
,Wave goodbye to all my friends
,I can't believe that my past always comes back to haunt me
,It always haunts me
,It always haunts me
,How can you blame me, they just watch as my box is buried
,The walls are shaking
,The Earth is breaking
,Breaking apart while you're grieving
,This distance between us, it always defeats us (it always defeats us, it always defeats us)
,Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,Our tears become rivers swimming in our own private hell
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,All the hearts that are breaking
,All the memories fading
,All the drugs they are taking
,All the drinks to erase me
,All the hearts that are breaking
,All the memories fading
,All the drugs they are taking
,All the drinks to erase me
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
,Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells

,I lost my place in lives
,Even in the morning
,I see the sun goes down
,Whatever you say “I leave the dream here right now”
,You know (I'm gone)
,Won't stop (stay here)
,Tell me what do you want what you want me to be
,My skin (you touch)
,This way (I seek)
,I'm hiding away
,Hiding away from you
,Now break away
,Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts that you've won
,Right away
,There was nothing to change
,Nothing can change what you've done
,I break away with the past
,Why won't you say it ?
,Now I won't let you down
,Destroy the weapons of hate
,I heard your voice through my body and soul
,We may have been running the fucking circle
,I break it all
,You point a gun at my head
,We stand against the door
,Break away
,Injecting the void
,It's running my head
,Brace yourself
,I'm hiding away
,Hiding away from you
,We cut code
,Come together
,Now break away
,Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts of the people you've won
,Right away
,There was nothing to change
,Nothing can change what you've done
,I break away with the past
,Why won't you say it ?
,Now I won't let you down
,Destroy these weapons of hate
,Now the bullet has entered your gun
,I want you to point a gun on my head
,You have to pull the trigger
,Just shoot and don't slip away
,Now break away
,Your weapons of hate will crush all the hearts you've won
,Right away there was nothing to change
,Nothing can change what you've done
,I break away
,I break away
,I break away
,
,I've forgotten who I am
,Afraid it's too late
,Was I wrong
,Was there hope all along
,Can't remember when I felt alive
,Illusions turn cold
,Lost myself but worse than anything
,I woke up on my own
,I remember thinking of impossible things
,Of never backing down to impossibility
,Dreamer
,Where have you gone
,Dreamer
,Will you beware
,Dreamer
,Dreamer
,Come home
,There nothing left but emptiness
,When you realise what you could have been
,Kept searching for the right moment
,When you just have to live in it
,You just have to live in it
,Dreamer
,Where have you gone
,Dreamer
,Will you beware
,Dreamer
,Dreamer
,Come home
,
,Will you listen to what I said
,Do you believe that I'm worth it
,I can't fall asleep
,I can't live with my dreams
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,You're running from everything
,That's seeping from the depths of me
,You're begging for anything
,That's a life I'll never see
,I'll keep searching I'm angry
,I've been haunted by my dreams
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head

,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,I'm trapped I'm trapped trapped in my head
,It's hard to know myself trapped in my own head

,Forgotten unwanted broken memories
,Confused by a heart that is haunted
,Mistaken fallen erasing
,The history that suffered in silence
,I just wanted you to know my name
,I just wanted you to feel the shame
,See you face to face
,And look me in the eyes can you see your lies
,Tell me you don't remember the son that you left behind
,Look into these eyes I hope you always remember
,That you were the sacrifice that gave me a better life
,Awakened you're tortured
,Slowly drowning in sorrow with empty excuses
,You can't escape this
,Every moment you regret I didn't deserve this
,I just wanted you to know my name
,I just wanted you to feel the shame
,See you face to face
,And look me in the eyes can you see your lies
,Tell me you don't remember the son you left behind
,Look into these eyes I hope you always remember
,That you were the sacrifice that gave me a better life
,Life life life
,I just wanted you to know my name
,I just wanted you to feel the shame
,See you face to face
,And looking in your eyes I can you see your lies
,Tell me you don't remember the son you left behind
,Look into these eyes I hope you always remember
,That you were the sacrifice
,I hope you always remember
,That you were the sacrifice
,I hope you always remember
,That you were the sacrifice
,That gave me a better life

,No matter the pain we hide inside
,We all struggle just to feel alive
,It's harder to see the light up ahead
,When you find yourself helpless
,Now let our voices be the change
,So we don't all end up the same
,I can't help but feel this way
,Let's raise our flags to the new way
,We're all insane in a beautiful way
,We won't change until the tide comes
,The tide comes
,You'll never be more than what they say
,Unless you stand and face the hate
,Always aware of where you came
,Lead those around you unafraid
,Now let our voices be the change
,So we don't all end up the same
,I can't help but feel this way
,Let's raise our flags to the new way
,We're all insane in a beautiful way
,We won't change until the tide comes
,The tide comes
,We're all insane in a beautiful way
,We won't change until the tide comes and pulls us all away
,We're all insane
,We're all insane
,We're all insane in a beautiful way

,
,I'm sinking in expectation
,Can't find my way out
,I deserve an explanation
,I lost myself in doubt
,Waiting for a revelation
,Do I deserve this shit
,When you feel there's nothing left
,That's when you'll find me dead
,Feels like I'm suffocating
,I'm suffocating
,The walls closing in on me
,I'm suffocating
,Now I'm unable to breathe
,Conserving energy
,It's like a disease
,Catastrophe
,Won't you please help me see
,Don't know if this will help
,There's more than this in me
,Don't know if this will help
,Feels like I'm suffocating
,I'm suffocating
,The walls closing in on me
,I'm suffocating
,I'm suffocating I'm suffocating
,Feels like I'm suffocating I'm suffocating

,No living savior to follow home
,Wandering hopeless into the unknown
,Is there hope to hope like them
,Save me from the hell I'm in
,We came dependent just to be branded
,It's hard to believe we don't belong
,Here we are standing together demanding
,Singing for those who don't belong
,So here we are
,Off in the unknown
,Aimless but tired of being alone
,Is there hope to hope like them
,Save me from the hell I'm in
,We came dependent just to be branded
,It's hard to believe we don't belong
,Here we are standing together demanding
,Singing for those who don't belong
,Lost and found I had no home
,Found myself when I gave up hope
,So don't forget your darkest hours
,Light the way to a life empowered
,Don't forget your darkest hours
,Light the way light the way
,We came dependent just to be branded
,It's hard to believe we don't belong
,We came dependent just to be branded
,It's hard to believe we don't belong
,Here we are standing together demanding
,Singing for those who don't belong
,Don't belong
,
,Tired of looking in the mirror
,Cracks seperate my face
,I'm not what you think
,I'm lost in make believe
,But why oh god why are you doing this to me
,Can't stop looking out my window
,I don't know who I am anymore
,You'll wash wash away all the secrets of my past
,The shattered reflection is all I ever had
,These are my last days cause hell has been calling for me
,Why am I crazy why am I crazy
,I am a disease and hell has been calling for me
,Why am I crazy why am I crazy
,Devour the darkness
,Hell find me
,Light defies me

,
,Dive in, take a breath
,Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
,Still choking on the bed
,Found your waste while the ember red keeps falling down and burning holes
,Until the pillow and the mattress glow
,Now I wanna be the tattoo ink that swims down through the needle in your skin
,And I wish I was poisonous
,Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug
,Do you remember the knife I kept?
,The sharper it got, the more you wanted me to use it
,I was lying to you, but you were lying too
,So what's left to do?
,What's left to say?
,Stop making friends, just us
,I'll decompose with you
,So light the fuse inside your brain and we will detonate
,You threw your drink at the wall
,It started raining wine and glass so
,Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack
,Gold locks on the cage
,Turn your diamond keys
,Open the door you'll see me digging out my getaway
,Hang the stars who pulled the pin out of my heart
,And just because you're screaming for my attention
,Does not mean I will waste my time
,So hold your breath and swim under the ice
,And modern anxiety
,That motherfucker never rests
,Our adrenaline is kickin' in so play the beat faster
,Head for the streets
,We're the puke and decay
,We're only dreaming, what's your problem baby?
,Don't mean to break your heart
,I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars
,In area code (666)
,And just because you're screaming for my attention
,Does not mean I will waste my time
,So hold your breath and learn how to swim underneath the ice
,Kill me if I end up like you
,And just because you're screaming for my attention
,Does not mean I will waste my time
,So hold your breath and swim under the ice
,I know that it's not safe here
,You did this to yourself but have no fear
,Just hold your breath and swim under
,
,Rage in us
,Your thirst I'm taking
,Pull the plug I'll keep on shaking
,And thrustin' about your apartment
,Drowned on blankets floral & fading
,Painful lust, two aching guts
,They tear through each other in the mirror
,This happy vacation, there's no motivation
,So hold me up
,You say you wanna chase the moon like fire
,Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
,Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
,Darker now
,Kicked out and sleeping in your car
,You roll the window down enough to dream and make believe
,Our lights knocked out, turned upside down
,And I'm just a stupid motherfucker
,Can't figure it out
,I want devil horns
,I wanna breathe in your rush
,I wanna leap when you want me to fly
,But darlin' I don't mean to beg
,But these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skin
,And now you wanna chase the moon like fire
,Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
,Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
,Close your eyes
,Picture you and I
,Selling daylight for gasoline
,So now we're gonna chase the moon like fire
,Yeah, together we can fake our own deaths here
,Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
,Just wanna be alone and watch
,Why can't we wanna be alone and watch?
,
,
,I'm mastering the art of miracles and flawless tragedies
,In here I spend everyday in captivity
,Devoured while the walls grow hands and teeth
,I cried and listened to the rain in a rental car
,One day somebody's gonna go and get pushed too far
,But now I don't know what to say
,Shall I deny my lungs their breathing rights?
,So give it up, give it up
,Don't let your mind slip away
,Don't drink, don't get so high
,Your beat's too obvious
,Not gonna say
,What you want me to say I guess you're right
,The less you're seen, the less you are
,But I don't even care anymore
,Anatomy of a ghost, invisible friend
,I won't pay for sanity, cause I don't wanna know
,Some things are better left alone
,But thanks for your concern and calls
,I'd put a bullet in my head if I lost you now
,You think you're getting the best of me
,Never even owned a bed, just a blood-red couch
,Disarm this smoke alarm
,Fuck you, no one's gonna ruin all our fun
,All that we want is this temporary release and distraction
,Some things are better left alone it seems
,I'm not everything you wanted me to be
,So I suggest you pray for a full recovery
,Your words were written in Us
,Cold blood
,Now
,Even with phantom power and ludicrous speed
,I can't run because betrayal won't come from my enemies
,I won't pray for sanity so baby here's a toast
,To things much better left alone
,It seems I'm not everything you wanted me to be
,In a dream on the way to the hospital I'll slip away
,What's happening to me?
,And as you drag the lake and pull me out
,Do you feel the shame inside you?
,And as my body lays before you now,
,do you feel my skin
,Is cold?
,
,
,
,
,Listen, do you hear my heart beat thump over the monitors?
,You pretend to close your eyes
,Don't breathe in
,Pieces of candy and leaks of light (leaks of light)
,Paint the floor 'round me
,Then without hesitating (hesitating)
,You took my hand and then we both started running
,Both started running
,There's no place to go
,Another bullet and we both started running
,Both started running too
,Save yourself, don't ever look back
,Nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles
,Creeping through these labyrinths I find
,Another dead end to the weekend
,But is this real life?
,Paper hearts turned ash begin to fly
,Over our heads I begin
,Screaming while the exit signs read "Heaven's waiting"
,Save yourself don't ever look back
,Nowhere to go and so and we both spin around in circles
,And I said, "Hey, what's on your mind?"
,I think about my life without you and I start to cry
,And I said, "Hey, it's alright"
,We'll make it
,I love you and I'll never leave your side
,
,Circles
,
,
,
,
,Surf to me
,Whatever you want
,And whenever breezing through
,Keep tearing my world apart
,As we lost the light
,Wet cash on the bar
,She fell victim to a violent wave
,And died on the jagged rocks
,But don't believe it's a never-ending summer
,Cause they don't exist
,Tied around your tongue in all the rage and spit
,So why am I the one falling apart?
,
,Cause you don't even know you're an angel
,Foolish am I for the times I come and go
,These stars defy love, so I close my eyes
,And sleep inside your worn-in bed outline
,Splash over your body while you drown on me
,You ain't seen nothin' yet
,Enter the galaxy of our sober demise
,To the young and without type
,In the morning hear all the birds sing
,It never stops
,Then, with tears in your eyes
,You smiled dressed in coppertone tan lines
,Oh I hope you don't regret me
,And sleep inside your worn-in bed
,And it won't be long 'till we drop this match
,When I burn to your fingertips, you can throw what's left
,So long, let's go and play those games you like
,But don't believe
,Cause yesterday I found her with her clothes still wet
,Crying in the shower on her knees she screamed
,"Why the fuck am I falling apart?"
,And it woke me up like a heart attack
,When you talk in your sleep I'll be there to slow your breath
,
,She paints in grey
,
,She closes her eyes
,'Till fireworks and palm trees almost look alike
,
,She looks up to me and whispers
,I won't be here in a year
,
,So I take the long road to think and wonder why
,I can't sleep with all this sunlight
,If there's still evidence of us
,
,Why can't that be enough
,Don't mean to drag you down
,You taste just like you always do
,
,Isabelle hides so I can find my way
,I'd give anything just to surround your dreams
,
,The envy of the dead
,The sound of scissors and sleep
,I can't believe you dreamed
,And pulled all of your clothes off
,You're not supposed to drink
,With what's inside your purse
,And not expect me to not to call you out
,I'm guiding your chin to my lips
,Using only my fingertips
,All we have are parking lots and nowhere to go
,If you love me then show me more
,
,Isabelle watches me from far away
,I'd give anything just to surround your dreams
,I know you like when the temperature rises to a boiling heat
,The chlorine and wine found
,He sees through her nightgown
,And everything fades away
,
,The stars awake
,But we can't see them out
,So why pretend
,
,Is there a train that travels back to yours at 5 am
,Or are we walking
,Car alarms and leaves that blow
,They're calling out our names
,But it's gone too far
,Your butane mouth will spit me into flames
,
,Sorry 'bout it I can't help it
,I'm an anarchist in love
,And I forgot to call you
,I can't break you down while
,I think about honey and the sweet new york sounds
,Isabelle hides so I can't find my way
,I'd give anything to carry on and on and on the same way
,
,The temperature rises to this boiling heat
,The chlorine and wine found
,He sees through her nightgown
,As saturday burns away
,

,Back in the days when I was young

,Self-medicate.
,While they sleep we let the night chase evil things away,
,And we're like animals, homesick from shows.
,We gotta kill everything before the night gets wasted.
,Maybe it seems so strange, but we don't even stress at all.
,'Cause we've got poison in our well.
,
,Come at me with everything you've got.
,
,Burst into flames, scream in the dark.
,I'm gonna light up this place
,and die in beautiful stars tonight.
,
,Does it even make a difference,
,When I'm sober I feel pain.
,As we run under the stars through cemetery backyards.
,Celebrate the way the night hides scars.
,So dance if it moves you,
,And jump in the fire, if it burns you.
,I'll throw my arms around you darlin',
,And we'll turn to ashes.
,
,Drown me in the flames, scream in the dark.
,I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars.
,But if these demons keep falling from the sky,
,It's alright
,Cause sometimes I love the way
,you swing the blade at everything in sight.
,Separate me from my own two hands.
,I've killed so many times.
,But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die.
,
,Kinda like the way you tell me,
,“Baby, please come home.
,I need you here right now.
,I'm crying underwater
,so you don't hear the sound.“
,
,
,Burst into flames
,What do you do when you're out of time?
,Scream in the dark
,Where do you go when they're right outside?
,I'm gonna light up this place
,And how do you scream when there's no one left around?
,And I will be the only light.
,I'll be the only light.

  Welcome to the end
 Of everything that haunts me
 Somehow I pretend
 All was meant to be
 I am not the saint here
 Never the good son
 Hell has taken over and I know
 
 When I say “Go”, runaway, runaway
 
 Where do I belong? 
 So sick of being shadows
 Scared to walk alone
 Now it’s time to roam
 I have always wanted
 All that I could own
 My wish was never granted till now

,Left nothing, nothing but scars

,I tried to numb the pain

,You're waiting for me to fail
,That ship will never sail
,Keep pulling and pushing me down

,I know you wish I was dead
,I'm stuck inside your head
,I'm taking and breaking your crown

What is the purpose?
Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux
So bring it on
Loose upon the world
Destruct like a juggernaut
Give it to me
Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses watch them cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog
Iron head
Iron head
Iron head
Crucify you
Iron head
Regenerate
Iron head
Exterminate
Iron head
Liberate and crucify you
What is my name?
Demonoid phenomenon
Laugh in your face
And break in now move along
Vent up on the brink
Appear another demigod
Suddenly forever knows
What it takes and where it goes
Paint it black inside your head
I defy what you have said

,Prelude
,The eagle born to those who pledged their lives and sacred honor
,Was smiled upon by God and freed from chains and iron collar
,He is held aloft on unity and by history revered
,For preserving peace through strength
,His wings now reach across two hundred years
,But for each of those and one year more
,God has smiled upon The Corps
,From the Barbary Coast to the Eastern Sand
,By sword, by gun, or by bare hand
,So it's been, and shall be weighed:
,Though many are born, few are "made"
,Faithful Always, they shall remain
,Dogs to loose when war is waged
,
,I am a Marine on the beach
,I'm a killin' machine
,With a need to bleed you when the light goes green
,Best believe, I'm in a zone to be
,From my Yin to my Yang to my Yang Tze
,Put a grin on my chin, come to me
,'cuz I'll win, I'm one-of-a-kind and I'll bring death
,To the place you're about to be:
,Another river of blood runnin' under my feet
,Forged in a fire lit long ago
,Stand next to me, you'll never stand alone
,I'm last to leave, but the first to go
,Hard Corps is the only way I know
,I feed on the fear of the devil inside of the enemy faces in my sights:
,Aim with the hand, shoot with the mind, kill with a heart like arctic ice
,I am a Devil-Dog I’m marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,I bask in the glow of the rising war,
,Lay waste to the ground of an enemy shore
,Wade through the blood spilled on the floor
,And if another one stands I’ll kill some more
,Bullet in the breech and a fire in me
,Like a cigarette thrown to gasoline
,If death don't bring you fear then death ain't brought by no Marine
,Come to the nightmare, come to me
,Deep down in the dark where the devil be
,In the maw with the jaws and the razor teeth
,Where the brimstone burns and the angel weeps
,Call to the gods if I cross your path and my silhouette hangs like a body bag
,Hope is a moment now long past, the shadow of death is the one I cast
,I am a Devil-Dog I'm marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Hell has no demon I won't overcome
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,For over 221 years our Corps has done two things for this great Nation
,We make Marines, and we win battles
,Never forget that!
,You are the first Marines
,And not all the Communists in hell can overrun you!
,Now I live lean and I mean to inflict the grief
,And the least of me is still out of your reach
,The killing machine's gonna do the deed　
,Until the river runs dry and my last breath leaves
,Chin in the air with a head held high
,I'll stand in the path of the enemy line
,Feel no fear, know my pride
,For God and Country I'll end your life
,I am a Devil-Dog I'm marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Hell has no demon I won't overcome
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,I made the devil himself turn and run
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Into the fire I will keep marchin' on

,Viaton on hymysi, vaikka liassa on käsi
,Häpeätkö ollenkaan noita tekemisiäsi?
,Tuskin kukaan sinua jäisi ikävöimään
,Jos vankilasi avaimen heitän menemään
,Milloinkaan ei saavu aamu
,Tahratonko sielusi, vaikka ryvettyisit
,Ei enää ketään kenelle valheitasi myisit
,Ovat sanelemat pirun ja röyhkeytesi työt
,Olkoon laitimmainen kerta kun pöydässäni syöt
,Pirunkieli(x4)
,Pirunkieli - Todenpieli(x3)
,Pirunkieli - Pirunkieli
,Lammasmainen hymysi, mutta veressä kätesi
,Tajuatko ollenkaan, että mikä sinuun pesi
,Hapantukoon kuseksi vuosikertaviini
,Ja odottakoon sinua tylsä giljotiini
,Miten saisit asettumaan tuon pelonhorkan
,Entä miten katseilta piiloon pukinsorkan
,Ovat sanelemat pirun ja ahneutesi yöt
,Nyt et lepoa saa päivin ja valvot kaiket yöt
,Now get the guns, the drugs, From my generation.

Violence in my head
Like a thorn that pierced my skin
Spilling strength on the floor where I stand
It surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me
Surrounds me, controls me
Shows weakness inside me
They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed
No one
No one
No one can deny
Sadness in my heart
Like a storm that ripped apart
All the fragments of what was happiness
It takes over, and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
Takes over, and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me
They've tried to kill me
But they won't succeed
No one
No one
No one can deny
No one
No one
No one can deny

Take one, take one more shot
One more shot at me
Take one, take one more shot
One more shot at me
And believe
And believe
Take one, take one more shot
One more shot at me
Take one, take one more shot
One more shot at me
And believe

Takes over and numbs me
Shows the fear inside me

Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue
Colors changing hue
Morning field of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless head on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in the ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
Now I think I know what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

,And as we wind on down the road
,Our shadows taller than our soul.
,There walks a lady we all know
,Who shines white light and wants to show
,How ev'rything still turns to gold.
,And if you listen very hard
,The tune will come to you at last.
,When all are one and one is all
,To be a rock and not to roll.

,Would you still remember me?
,For I must be travelling on, now,

,When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
,Out of the corner of my eye.
,I turned to look but it was gone.
,I cannot put my finger on it now.
,The child is grown, the dream is gone.
,I have become comfortably numb.

,It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down.
,Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago,
,But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows.

,One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do,
,It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you.
,I try to make love but it ain't no use.

,Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried.
,Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way;
,Go away, Heartbreaker.

,A guilty bliss, so inviting （let me in）, nailed to the cross

,The rash of negativity is seen one sid
,Edly, burn away the day

,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
,You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
,Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
,Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
,
,Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
,You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
,And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
,No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
,
,And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
,And racing around to come up behind you again
,The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
,Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
,
,Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
,Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
,Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
,The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
,
,Home, home again
,I like to be here when I can
,And when I come home cold and tired
,It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
,Far away across the field
,The tolling of the iron bell
,Calls the faithful to their knees
,To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

,You get a shiver in the dark
,It's raining in the park but meantime
,South of the river you stop and you hold everything
,A band is blowing Dixie double four time
,You feel alright when you hear that music ring
,You step inside but you don't see too many faces
,Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
,Too much competition too many other places
,But not too many horns can make that sound
,Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town
,You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
,Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
,And an old guitar is all he can afford
,When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
,And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
,He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
,He can play honky tonk just like anything
,Saving it up for Friday night
,With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing
,And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner now
,Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
,They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
,It ain't what they call rock and roll
,And the Sultans and the Sultans played Creole Creole
,And the man he steps right up to the microphone
,And says at last just as the time bell rings
,'goodnight now it's time to go home'
,And he makes it fast with one more thing
,'We are the Sultans we are the sultans of Swing'
,
,Come wit it now!
,Come wit it now!
,The microphone explodes, shattering the bone
,Either drop tha hits like de la O or get tha fuck off tha commode
,Wit tha sure shock, sure ta make tha bodies drop
,Drop an don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
,Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' tha thirst of tha power dons
,That five sided fist-a-gon
,Tha rotten sore on tha face of mother earth gets bigger
,Tha triggers go into ya purse

,All of us beleive
,That this is not up to you

,Hey' Hey' Hey
,Hey' Hey' Hey
,Let's Go
,
,How can we fake this anymore
,To turn our backs away' and chose to just ignore
,（Some say）Some say it's ignorance
,It makes 'em feel some innocent
,It takes away a part of me
,That I won't let go of
,Tell me why can't you see' it's not the way
,When we all fall down' it won't be too late
,Why is there no reason we can't change
,When we all fall down' who will take the blame
,Will it take
,
,Nothing could ever be this real
,A life unsatisfied' that I could never feel
,（Some Say）This future's not so bright
,Some can't make the sacrifice
,It's much more than just black and white
,And I won't follow

,Now the damage has been done
,And this machine has begun on a path of destruction
,We need the medicine
,To reverse what's been done
,Before this disease has destroyed everything we know
,EVERYTHING WE KNOW!
,
,All we need is a reason (All we need is a reason)
,All we need is right here inside us all
,
,With our weapons drawn and all our resources gone
,We're facing extinction
,The only antidote consists of blood, sweat, and hope
,And a blueprint to save us from all that we've become
,ALL THAT WE'VE BECOME!
,
,All we need is a reason (All we need is a reason)

,
,Yeah!
,Oh
,
,Now the gears they will fail to turn
,As the lights go out
,And the sun will be all that burns on our way down
,(On our way down)
,But right now we have to understand the problem
,AND OVERCOME!
,
,So arm yourself
,You'll mind your gun
,It's time to learn
,Accept what's done, and yeah
,REPAIR THIS DESTRUCTION!

,
,
,Cause of you, I'm lying awake at night
,but I'm seeing our pictures of you,
,As I close my eyes
,I fade my way into the loss of my dream world.
,
,It's a place of trust, would you meet me there?
,There's no time to spare, come and show me you care,
,That you're believing that here we can win!
,
,All of my dreams, are all I see,
,Try not to wake me, can't you see!
,All of my dreams, are all I wanna see,
,Try not to wake me, try not to wake me!
,
,Cause of you, my tries to not think of you,
,they just end up in one million thoughts,
,It's way too much to mention,
,see what I mean when you see my creation.
,
,It's a place of trust, I can meet you there.
,There's no time to spare, come and show me you care,
,That you're believing that here we can win!

,All of my dreams, are all I see,
,Try not to wake me, can't you see!
,All of my dreams, are all I wanna see,
,Try not to wake me, try not to wake me!
,Trapped inside my own dreams, I'm not complaining,
,Leave behind all I offer your kind, here we could disappear?
,
,All of my dreams are all I see,
,try not to wake me, let me be!
,
,All of my dreams, are all I see, （I See）
,Try not to wake me, can't you see! （You See）

,Hold  on  slow  down  again  from  the  top  now  and  tell  me  everything
,I  know  I've  been  gone  for  what  seems  like  forever
,But  I'm  here  now  waiting
,To  convince  you  that  I'm  not  a  ghost  or  a  stranger
,But  closer  than  you  think
,She  said,"just  go  on  to  what  you
,Pretend  is  your  life  but
,Please  don't  die  on  me"
,Wings  won't  take  me
,Heights  don't  phase  me
,So  take  a  step
,But  don't  look  down
,Take  a  step
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,I  think  I'm  at  the  edge  now  but  I  could  be  wrong
,I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,Perpetual  motion  the  image  won't  focus
,A  blur  is  all  that's  seen
,But  here  in  this  moment  like  the  eye  of  the  storm
,It  all  came  clear  to  me
,I  found  a  shoulder  to  lean  on
,An  infallible  reason  to  live  all  by  itself
,I  took  one  last  look  from  the  heights  that  I  once  loved
,And  then  I  ran  like  hell
,Wings  won't  take  me
,Heights  don't  phase  me
,So  take  a  step
,But  don't  look  down
,Take  a  step
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,I  think  I'm  at  the  edge  now  but  I  could  be  wrong
,I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,I  count  the  times  that  I've  been  sorry
,I  know,I  know
,Now  my  compassion  slowly  drowns
,I  know,I  know
,If  there's  a  time  these  walls  could  guard  you
,I  know,I  know
,Then  let  that  time  be  right  now
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,I  think  I'm  at  the  edge  now  but  I  could  be  wrong
,I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop （ready  to  fall）
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop （ready  to  fall）
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop （ready  to  fall）
,Now  I'm  standing  on  the  rooftop  ready  to  fall
,
,Yeah, I've got nowhere left to hide
,No time left for a compromise
,Do I push back harder than I have before
,Or just fall if I can't decide?
,That danger is real, I feel it all the time
,So I wear it in the name to remind me why
,Everything I gave up or I left behind
,Just to be where I am tonight, yeah
,But you can't touch me, I can't be touched
,You can't hold me, the weight's too much
,You can't buy me, I have no price
,I have no backup, I have no crutch
,One last attempt, all-out attack
,And if you push me, I'll push you back
,And should I fall, you'll go down with me
,Make sure you remember that
,Do you have what it takes to loosen the vice?
,You live the excuse but it comes with a price
,If you've got nothing at all, you've got nothing to lose
,If you're too scared to choose, then what are you waiting for?
,There's nothing left inside of me 'cause I've given everything
,You see it in my eyes, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die for this
,So give me your worst!
,
,You have to decide what sets you apart
,If passion is dead or defines who you are
,You can forgive but never forget
,If you're scared of the scars then you're already dead
,You're already dead
,There's nothing left inside of me 'cause I've given everything
,You see it in my eyes, I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die for this, so
,So say the worst thing, the worst thing you can say to me (What are you waiting for?)
,So say the worst thing, the worst thing you can say to me
,This is what it all comes down to
,You either bend or you break
,Will you destroy what destroys you?
,If you give it all up they can't take it away
,This is what it all comes down to
,You either bend or you break
,Will you destroy what destroys you?
,If you give it all up (What are you waiting for?)

,
,Too late, the melody is over
,The joke seems to be on me cos I'm the one not laughing
,
,Down here on the floor
,Deflate, the mystery of living
,In the most heartless fashion I could ever Imagine
,No pretense of decor
,
,Another place and time, without a great divide
,And we could be flying deadly high
,I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake
,
,Another place and time, without a warning sign
,And we could be dying angel style
,I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake
,
,I'll dream you... wide awake
,
,With me, disaster finds a playfield
,Love seems to draw dark,
,twisted pleasure tearing at me
,Cos I can't let you go
,Mercy, like water in a desert
,Shine through my memory like jewelry in the sun Where are you now
,
,
,Another place and time, without a great divide And we could be flying deadly high
,
,I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake Another place and time, without a warni
,And we could be dying angel styl I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake
,
,I'll dream you wide awake It's like I'm racing to the sun, blindly face blazing gun
,
,Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you
,
,Like I'm racing not to run, give more when I have none
,Cos I'm afraid I will be left here without you... wide awake
,
,Another place and time, without a great divide
,And we could be flying deadly high
,I'll sell my soul to dream you wide awake

You think you know me*
Got me figured out
Your casting shadows
Casting doubt
You think you know me
You think I care
You should spend some time sometime with the person in the mirror
I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
You don't know me
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
I'm a tooth on the cog that you built to spill
You don't know me
I'm not defined by what you think I am
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
All like diamonds without the shine
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find
I'm a crow, I'm the most with the least to gain
I'm a fading Mona Lisa in a plywood frame
You don't know me
I'm a ring on a tree in a life that fell
What I did I done good and what I done I did well
You don't know me
Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
Drawing borders
Lines on a map we don't need
I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
You don't know me
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
I'm the time that got away
It's already gone
You don't know me

,
,Somewhere between happy and total fucking wreck
,Feet sometimes on solid ground and sometimes at the edge
,To spend your waking moments, simply killing time
,Is to give up on your hopes and dreams, to give up on your
,Life for you's been less than kind(Who we are)
,So take a number, stand in line(Who we are)
,We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt(Who we are)
,How we survive is what makes us who we are(Who we are)
,An obvious disinterest, a barely managed smile
,A deep nod in agreement, a status quo exile
,I shirk my obligations, I miss all your deadlines
,I excel at quitting early and fucking up my life
,Life for you's been less than kind(Who we are)
,So take a number, stand in line(Who we are)
,We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt(Who we are)
,But how we survive is what makes us who we are(Who we are)
,All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
,Everything always works out, I have never felt so fucking great
,All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
,Everything always works out, I have never felt so great
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,Life isn't like this
,(Are we verging on an answer)
,(Or fucking up our lives?)
,For you's been less than kind(Who we are)
,So take a number, stand in line(Who we are)
,We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt(Who we are)
,But how we survive is, is what makes us who we are(Who we are)
,That's what makes us who we are(Who we are)
,What makes us who we are(Who we are)
,That's what makes us who we are(Who we are)
I drew a line in the sand
And made my simple demand
I kissed You one last time goodbye
I watched You walk out of my life
I didn't mean to mistreat You
I need to reach You, I need to reach You
There's got to be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay
My heart is buried in the ground
My hands are tied, my feet are bound
And it's the smoke that wets my eyes
As I burn You from my life
I didn't mean to mistreat You
I need to reach You, I need to reach You
There's got to be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay
There's got to be a better way
And longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
But tonight I need to get through
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
But tonight I need to get through
There's got to be a better way
And longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay
There's got to be a better way
And longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
(I need to reach You, I need to reach You)
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
(I need to reach You, I need to reach You)
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
(I need to reach You, I need to reach You)
Hate me tomorrow if You need to
(I need to reach You)

,We live in a cold dark world with venom in its veins
,You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be okay
,It's on the attack, it's a war, it's a game
,A ball and chain, chew my arm off to get away
,Don't fight it or deny it, invite it
,'Cause when it feels like a kick in the teeth I can take it
,Throw your stones and you won't see me break it
,Say what you want, take your shots
,You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth
,Na, na, na, na, na, na
,(Kick in the teeth)
,Na, na, na, na, na, na
,I gotta say thanks 'cause you kick me when I'm down
,I'm bleeding out the mouth, I hope you know I'm stronger now
,I'm taking the hate, I'm turning it all around
,I won't go down 'til I'm six feet underground

,The blood is rushing to my head
,This room is spinning around the bed
,A flashing image perforates
,Tarnishes memories of grace
,A bursting firey fortune to misshape
,And if my body makes it out
,Unscathed and safe from broken vows
,A promise spoken leaves me holding on
,I just can't get a hold of
,Why we only hurt the ones we love
,The burning hearts still keep us strong
,A crack has formed in the foundation
,The floor is falling out from under me
,A pleading loser makes his case
,A liar shakes his head and breaks
,A life of honor turns into his shame
,And if my body makes it out
,Unscathed and safe from broken vows
,A promise spoken leaves me holding on
,I just can't get a hold of
,Why we only hurt the ones we love
,The burning hearts still keep us strong
,
,It's all my fault
,This eagle's flying
,Down below where shadows fall
,Now it's sinking in
,And I'm sinking into this
,Place I never thought I'd be
,You can't trust me, I'm not worthy
,You won't ever feel this way
,The storm is moving overhead
,The wind is blowing back, we've been mislead
,
,And if my body makes it out
,Unscathed and safe from broken vows
,A Promise spoken leaves me holding on
,I just can't get a hold of
,Why we only hurt the ones we love
,The burning hearts still keep us strong
,There's a fire burning inside me cold steel calls out my name
,Tempted to give in to the rage
,Torn apart by this affliction locked up inside myself
,This life is much too young to fade
,I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside
,Incomplete but now I see
,This won't be the end of me
,The world around me sells an empty promise
,They build you up just to watch you fall
,It's time to meet this face to face
,I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside
,Incomplete but now I see
,This won't be the end of me
,Black and white melt into grey till every truth is stripped away
,When nothing's wrong nothing's ok
,Everyone has been betrayed
,I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside
,Incomplete but now I see
,This won't be the end of me
,I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside
,Incomplete but now I see
,This won't be the end of me
,The Used - Blood On My Hands
,
,
,You felt the coldness in my eyes
,Something I'm never revealing
,Though you got used to my disguise,
,Catching this awful feeling
,It's the meaning I let you know,
,Cause I never showed, I had my reasons
,I hate to say that I told you so, but I told you so...
,
,There's blood on my hands, like the blood in you
,Some things can't be treated
,So don't make me don't make me be myself around you
,Straight from your eyes it's burying me,
,Beautifully so disfigured
,This other side that you can't see
,Just praying you won't remember
,
,Feel the pain that I never showed
,And I hope you know, it's never healing
,I hate to say that I told you so, but I told you so...

,Define your meaning of war
,To me it's what we do when we're bored
,I feel the heat comin off of the blacktop
,And it makes me want it more
,Because I'm hyped up, outta control
,If it's a fight I'm ready to go
,I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
,If you know what I already know
,
,It's been a long time coming
,And the tables' turned around
,Cause one of us is goin'
,One of us is goin' down
,I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
,Cause one of us is goin'
,One of us is goin' down!
,
,Define your meaning of fun
,To me it's when we're gettin' it done
,I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
,So get ready for another one
,Let's take a trip down memory lane
,The words circulate in my brain
,You can treat this like another all I'm saying
,But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain
,
,It's been a long time coming
,And the tables' turned around

,I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
,Cause one of us is goin'
,One of us is goin' down!
,
,This is hardly worth fighting for
,But it's the little petty sh*t that I can't ignore
,With my fist in your face and your face on the floor
,It'll be a long time comin'
,But you got the message now
,Cause I was never goin'
,Yeah, you're the one that's going down!
,
,One of us is going down!
,I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
,Cause one of us is goin'

Noch ruht in stiller Harmonie
dicht gedrängte Energie
Als Auftakt der Unendlichkeit
aus einer ursprünglichen Singularität
bilden sich, woraus die Welt besteht
Materie, Raum und Zeit
So ist im Ursprung dieser Welt
das Universum in sich selbst geboren
begann dann in sich mit seiner Expansion
um sich noch bis heute auszudehnen
Ungezügelt noch in diesen Anfangstagen
sucht es bis in weite Ferne
doch findet den Anfang es im Dunkeln
und verweilt so eine Ewigkeit
Der Menschenverstand zu eingeschränkt
macht zur Wahrheit, was er sich ausdenkt 
Doch die uns bekannten Welten
sind nicht von einem Gott geschaffen
werden wider der Meinung vieler Adamsaffen
auch weiter über alle Götter gelten
Es maßt sich an der Mensch zu wissen 
was die Welt im Innersten zusammenhält
Auch wenn die scheinbare Wahrheit noch so grinst
ists doch nur ein weitres Hirngespinst
Wer weiß schon, wo der Ursprung liegt
und kennt den Quell, der alles schafft?
Sieht nicht der Wahrheit Angesicht
weil es oftmals scheint zu skurril
Blendet aus, was er nicht sehen will
und denkt sich aus jene neue Geschicht
von einer unbegreiflichen Kraft
mit der er am Ende über alles siegt
Wie später in des Menschen Welt
folgten nach der Blüte dunkle Jahre
der Fortschritt wurde eingestellt
gebettet auf die Totenbahre
Doch das Zeitalter der Dunkelheit
endete mit einem Funkeln
es bildeten sich Galaxien und Sterne
so viele, dass wir sie nicht zu zählen wagen
Und uns doch häufig zu ihnen sehnen
Kannte der Zufall seinen Weg denn schon?
Realitäten zu öffnen wie bloße Tore
Doch seht selbst, womit alles steht und fällt
作词 : Beckmann, Weinerhall
Troops at attention in shining armour
 They stand before me in total loyalty.
 Raising their fists into the air
 And swearing their allegiance to me.
 
 Upon a stallion of finest blood
 I sit with the greatest of pride.
 As I behold my vast empire
 I hold the royal standard high.
 It dances in the roaring wind
 As the salutes are heard in the sky.
 
 The foretold master I am.
 My future is already revealed
 In the scrolls of the prophecy:
 "...And he shall conquer the world
 And rule it with great majesty."
 
 Hail me as the man of steel.
 Hail me as the son of gods.
 Hail me as the king of yours.
 I am the chosen one.
 
 We are the undefeatable
 So be proud of what you are.
 Against the threats of the world
 We stand united today.
 Let's not take their mocking,
 Let's invade and make them obey.

Eines Tages reiste eine Riesin voller Schönheit
Durch die Wälder Asgards, Gullveig rief man sie.
Als sie vor den Toren Valhalls Einlass begehrte,
Öffneten die Asen ihr, voller Sympathie.
Gullveigs lächeln hatte Macht ihr Plan war ein gemeiner.
Mit der Kraft der Schönheit hat sie Odins Volk getrügt.
Einmal in der Feste luden Odin und die andren
Gullveig ein zutrinken, sie nahm an.
Als das Fest gefeiert wurde fing sie an zu reden
Über Gold und Geld und was man damit alles kann.
Viele Asen hörten zu und fingen an zu schmachten,
Wollten Reichtum, stritten dann und schlugen aufeinander ein.
Als der Streit am ärgsten war, die Asen sich bekriegten,
Blickte Vater Odin, Gullveig ins Gesicht.
Er sah wie sie lachte, wie sie dieser Groll erfreute.
Dass dort Schwerter kreisten, darum scherte sie sich nicht.
"Brüder", rief er "haltet ein! Das Weib will uns vernichten.
Zwietracht ist der Hexensaat, es keimt in ihrem Blut!"
Kaum gesprochen endete der Kampf der Asenmeute.
Alle blickten jählings auf die Hexe voller Hass.
Gullveig fühlte Augenblicklich, dass die List nicht glückte.
Sie fing an zu zittern, wurde plötzlich leichenblass.
Odin schrie: "Dein falsches spiel soll deinen Tod besiegeln.
Brennen sollst du Hexenweib, dein Ende sei gewiss!"
Augenblicklich stürzten sich die Asen auf die Hexe,
Banden sie und schlugen ihr die Fäuste in den Leib.
Odin sprach: "Der Scheiterhaufen soll dein Ende bringen,
Niemand stört der Asenruhe UND NUN BRENNE WEIB!"
Kaum gesprochen ward es wahr, die Hexe stand in Flammen.
Als das Feuer ausgebrannt war, lachte Gullveig laut.
"Niemand ist imstande, mir mein Leben zu entreißen",
Sprach die Riesin, doch die Asen taten es erneut.
Weitere zwei Male wollten sie das Weib entzünden,
Doch die Hexe starb nicht und das hat sie nicht erfreut.
Gullveig floh nach Osten, um den Asen zu entrinnen.
Odin und die seinen blieben Ahnungslos zurück

Du ska bli pinad för dina brott.
Instrumental
Sacred the enclosing welkin of dawn
As the blazing red pours over the firmament
The first light runs through my outstretched hands
I see your face, shining on me
Puissance never running dry
Thy maul and staff
They comfort me
Thou art my shepherd, I shall not want
Thy maul and staff, they comfort me
Thou maketh me to lie down in pastures green
Thou leadest me beside the still waters
Bright sun of the night
Begetter, sempiternal force, fire of existence
Sparks of life emit when you strike
Your mallet's target is never missed
No man can fathom the vastness in your hand
Sucellos
Atir aissom
Rodatis buiotutos
Celle!
The times surrender, sun of the Otherworld
The wolf's hunt won't be in vain
As the raven homes and finds the isle
Nantosuelta's noble servant
Escorting the soul
Into the darkness where life is born

,There lived a certain man in Russia, long ago
,He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
,Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
,But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
,He could preach the Bible like a preacher
,Full of ecstasy and fire
,But he also was the kind of teacher
,Women would desire
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,There was a cat that really was gone
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Russia's greatest love machine
,It was a shame, how he carried on
,He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
,But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
,In all affairs of state he was the man to please
,But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
,For the queen, he was no wheeler dealer
,Though she'd heard the things he'd done
,She believed, he was a holy healer
,Who would heal her son
,repeat
,But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
,For power became known to more and more people
,The demands to do something about
,This outrageous man became louder and louder
,"This man's just got to go", declared his enemies
,But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
,No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
,Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
,Then one night, some men of higher standing
,Set a trap, they're not to blame
,"Come to visit us", they kept demanding
,And he really came
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,They put some poison into his wine
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Russia's greatest love machine
,He drank it all and said, "I feel fine"
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,They didn't quit, they wanted his head
,Ra-Ra-Rasputin
,Russia's greatest love machine
,And so they shot him till he was dead
,Oh, those Russians
Ich bin heilig
Er ist heilig - hört nur wie er spricht
Ich bin heilig
Er ist heilig - das Licht das ihn umgibt
Ich bin heilig
Er ist heilig - gestärkt durch seine Macht
Von dunklen Schatten er bewacht
Ihr kommt mich zu bestaunen
Wartet auf mein Wort
Sagt Ja und Amen, schenkt mir Glauben
Denkt nicht nach ob es sich lohnt
Ich kann euch viel erzählen
Sag das was euch gefällt
Verspreche euch die Seligkeit
Für eure tote Welt
Auf Lüge und Neid
Folgt Verderben und Leid
Ich glaube das hast du nicht erkannt
Nur Hass und Begier
Regen sich in dir
Wenn du voller Argwohn auf mich blickst
Ich bin was ganz Besond'res
Wenn ihr mir vertraut
Schenkt mir euren Beifall
Werft euch vor mir in den Staub

The last night falls on my mind, 
I see Devil steps are behind, 
I'm feeling sure, in the arms of the church. 
I want to escape from your gaze, 
I want to light our blaze, to warm my heart and to burn my old fears...strong 
But now the 
Star is rising, we trust in more and more 
My Lord will light our fire, until we carry on 
There is a magic spirit that open up the gale: this is the reason why 
I'll find my way 
The cross will sign the end of our darkness, black spirits come inside the 
Heaven Church. 
My sword can snatch the heart of the 
Black Angel, a hope can start we praise the 
Heaven Church 
I want to guide you again, 
I'm really screaming your name, you only have to look after my 
Star I've just discovered the way, there's nothing to cry or to save 
Lucifer you are going to know your defeat...
Yeah And now the 
Star is rising, we follow her shining light. 
My Lord will bring his fire to rescue my 
Mankind The trace of magic spirit will push us to the 
North. 'cause now the time is right to throw my sword , 
Take me to the fire, show me your desire 
Devil is a liar, now we caught his life 
Riding on your feelings, in this storm so thrilling 
I can stop your nightmare, 
I am in the 
Church , 
I'm fighting 
Belzebu He won't derange no more 
It's only here for you 
The Victory has come , 
Now I want to go under this town, 
I want to share this magic sound, 
I really want to walk this way 
This is the path of our mistakes... this is the legion of our souls , 
Never ending fire... 
Leave Lucifer dying... 
In my wildest dreams 
I can understand a way 
Never ending glory... 
This is the brave story... 
Let us start the party: we are going glorify our 
God , 
Bring me to the 
Heaven. I will pray forever. 
Take me to the 
Legend We have fought together , 
My spirit is coming to join the black sword to the sea. 
The battle is over, the triumph we got 
Only our love can protect our planet 
The witch from our fears is ready to leave our souls , 
Come back to the 
Earth, White 
Warrior, the danger has disappeared: only your heart can keep the world in peace, really 
But remember...until love erase hate, nothing can upset your dreams 
Otherwise a new 
Devil will be born before you can think about it. 
Be careful! , 
The last night falls on my mind, the 
Devil's arms are behind: 
I really want to protect our world 
Under the sweet 
Princess gaze, only a hope can remain...all my desire will get our way, now 
So now the star is rising, 
I will follow his breeze, my 
Lord will light our fire to cure our black disease. 
There is a simple prayer that we will cry along 
So now my voice is writing one more song 
The cross will sign the way to 
Paradise, my spirit goes to cure the 
Jesus soul 
There is no way to throw away our pleasure 
We breathe, we love into the 
Heaven Church.

,The feeble leafs decline
,Enshrined in downing deep
,The mourn abandoned plains
,Laid down in somber sleep
,Misty shades engulf the sky
,Like past,worn memories
,The bird’s song fills the whispering breeze
,With autumns melody
,
,The lunar pale grim shape
,At evening’s sight renews
,It’s silented wail relieves
,Repressed thoughts anew
,I hear the lonesome choir
,Of fortunes past my way
,Disdained in fiery weeps
,Throughout my every day
,These skies I hail and treasure thee
,Most pleasant misery
,Not pittes thron I shelter thine
,Mysterious harmony
,
,Draw on most pleasant night
,Shade my lorn exposed sight
,For my grief’s when shadows told
,Shall be eased in mist enfold
,Why should the foolish’s hope
,Thy unborn passioned cry exhaust unheard
,Beneath this pleasant sky?
,For if the dusking day declined
,Could delight be far behind?

This is the great final fight of gods and beasts
When they stand face to face
When honour and force awakes
A war of different races
Everyone will see
And no one will forget this moment
When everything collapses
Ref: Three years of dying
Three years of coldness
All the lights died out
All the blossoms withered
Three years of dying
Three years of coldness
The wolf and the snake were unfettered
And Odin is defeated
Death devours life
The world goes up in smoke
And only dust is left
And no one will forget this moment
Only when the dust is left
Ref: Three years...
Spoken: This is the great final fight
When honour and force awakes
Ref: Three years

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come under cover
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I a doubt, baby when I'm alone
Love is a ring on the telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel, under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

As Earth was young I was alone
Humans were like larvae in the ground
Ymir's sons ruled the world
'til Wotan's birth
Tales, songs, I'm the Wanderer
Ases, Vanes, I am your keeper
Mist, fog, the Storyteller
Dawn, dust, I am your father
Travelling, whispering, crying alone
Bewitching, enchanting, the Wanderer
For six thousand years I dwelt here
In the darkness I carry the light
Travelling, whispering, laughing alone
Bewitching, protecting, storyteller
Gods of North, I'm your servant
Men of faith, hear my tale to the end
Tales, songs, I'm the Wanderer
Ases, vanes, I am your keeper
Mist, fog, the Storyteller
Dawn, dust, I am your father
Travelling, whispering, living alone
Bewitching, muttering words of wisdom
I'm echoing the words of old gods
I'm your fathers' voice, the wanderer
Travelling, whispering, dying alone
Bewitching, slaughtering, the Wanderer

,Dry fallen leaves that rise like a cloud
,Time is a torch in a field of lost faces
,Kissed by the mist, you kneel on the ground
,Shadowed by years, smiles you remember
,Half-recalled movements float in the fog
,There’s no dread you’ll forget in the dead of December
,Hear the dawn’s breeze echo night’s song
,Remain on, build your eerie Eden
,Swim in your enchanted land
,Seek your heaven, build your eerie Eden
,Memory is a sea of sand

,Torn as the earth where the sender lies

,I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems.
,I've got to open my eyes to everything.
,Without a thought
,Without a voice
,Without a soul
,Don't let me die here
,There must be something wrong.
,Bring me to life.
,Wake me up.
,Wake me up inside.
,I can't wake up.
,Wake me up inside.
,Save me.
,Call my name and save me from the dark.
,Wake me up.
,Bid my blood to run.
,I can't wake up.
,Before I come undone.
,Save me.
,Save me from the nothing I've become.
,Bring me to life.
,I've been living a lie
,There's nothing inside.
,Bring me to life
,
,What greater light Shall I obey
,Like all immortals I will make my way
,I've seen the rifts and heard the songs
,I am immortal, must I obey?
,I can smell the fire
,Hear the hammers and the wheels
,I can feel the fear inside of me
,No birds are singing
,No sound of the trees
,The growing darkness all around me
,Third immortal
,The lord and the servant
,Do I have to ride?
,There are others in need
,Must I call the lords of the skies?
,I know my heart
,And I know my way
,This is where the end
,Shall begin
,What greater light Shall I obey?
,Like all immortals I will make my way
,I've seen the rifts and heard the songs
,I am immortal, must I obey?
,Raining ashes tears of doom
,There is a longer road
,It's not a trick of the light
,Crimson colours in the sky
,I could fight, I could run away
,I am here for the cause
,The great Plan shall remain
,For the reason I will stay
,Third immortal
,The lord and the servant
,Spirit of the old
,From the light of the ghost
,I have been awake for too long
,But now I know it's my time
,I shall bow to the greater light
,Like all immortals I make my way
,I have been hiding all my power
,I'm a servant I will obey
,This will be my finest hour
,This will be my finest hour...
,
,
,
,I remember how you breathe, I feel your heartbeat
,Tell me have we met before
,Something in the way you move
,A cloud across the moon, a vessel looking for the shore
,Do you know me, really know me?
,Are you passing by?
,I've been waiting for a lover to see me like no other
,There's a road to be discovered, I'm dying to be uncovered
,Image hidden in the clay, words in melody
,I get it and I don't at once
,Keep it secret and exposed
,'Cause when I get too close, I feel it and it makes me numb
,Do you know me, really know me?
,Are you passing by?
,I've been waiting for a lover to see me like no other
,There's a road to be discovered, I'm dying to be uncovered
,Uncovered
,I want to show you all my colors
,Underneath it all, lies the naked truth
,Speaking through me speaking through you
,I want to show you all my colors
,I'm waiting
,I've been waiting for a lover to see me like no other
,There's a road to be discovered, I'm dying to be uncovered
,Uncovered
,Tonight I'm without you
,The raindrops are falling
,With candle light burning
,For you I'll be waiting here
,If all of our days have no more light
,And all of our dreams are lost tonight
,The stars can all fall and everything turn to grey
,I will stay
,Graceful and loving
,Beautiful and soothing
,Can't breath without you
,There's no life without you here
,If all of our days have no more light
,And all of our dreams are lost tonight
,The stars can all fall and everything turn to grey
,I will stay
,If all of our days have no more light
,And all of our dreams are lost tonight
,The stars can all fall and everything turn to grey
,If all of our days have turned to night
,And all of our dreams are lost and lies
,The stars can all fall and everything turn to grey
,I will stay
独自走在这条熟悉的街，
忽然想起你的名字，
有种心酸悄悄涌上心口，
也许还是无法挽留.


走在这条熟悉的街，
忽然想起你的名字，
有种心酸悄悄涌上心口，
也许还是无法挽留。
太阳每天都温暖着大地，
我却没有漂亮的外衣，
有种精神流淌在我心里，
已经烙下深深的痕迹
我曾经是个多么坚强的男人 ，
我会抚平我受伤的疤痕，
岁月的轮回，旋转着我的孤单，
却已发现你不在我身边 
，我向往那年美好的冬天，
就像一副忧伤的电影片段，
我站在路口，
不知道该我哪儿走，
我倔强的伤口有些疼。
其实谁也不用为谁停留，
喝吧，
活着像杯烈酒，
用它来温暖我的胸膛，
用它来痊愈我的伤口！
我曾经是个多么坚强的男人 
，我会抚平我受伤的疤痕，
岁月的轮回，旋转着我的孤单，
却已发现你不在我身边 。
我向往那年美好的冬天，
是你的心曾经给我温暖，
我站在路口，
像一块坚硬的石头，
我倔强的伤口有些疼。
我向往那年洁白的冬天，
就像一幅忧伤的电影片段
，在每一条街，
不停的反复上演，
这场画面有你出现
，这场画面，有你出现！

,假使忽然有意外 遗下一生片段
,藏在黑盒里面 担心将来给发现
,查阅当中记录 留着这里结局
,航道已经忘掉了 全部理想遗落了
,犹像我死了 是完了 就完了
,.
,这算不算讽剌 重读一生故事
,还未找出意义 我会不会羞愧
,行动思想说话 全部不堪记下
,遗落了的遗落了 忘掉了的忘掉了
,难道我死了 是完了 就完了
,.
,说要飞上天际 其后跨出每步
,却都不对路 我这一世怎么过
,怕今天决定 来日不忍细认
,遗落了的遗落了 忘掉了的忘掉了
,难道我死了 是完了 就完了
,.
,好比星尘会殒落 随着一生闭幕
,前事纷纷散落 证据彼时虽确鉴
,无论怎么法落 还是相当错愕

OREA啊EA哈 请给我爱的力量
OREA啊EA哈 让我们爱到疯狂

少年仔 机车骑慢一点 那是别人的女儿 不是你的人

雷光和闪电 都在我眼前
风花和雪月 都抛在后面
我知道这一次的感觉就是
等待好久的那份 爱 她在我面头前

也曾经幻想 美梦会实现
也曾经祈祷 奇迹会出现
你可知当我第一次看见你
我的心就是你的 爱 已没有人能挡 

这是种好奇妙的感觉 
心像火在烧 人在风中飞 你是我生命的能源
everybody come on

请给我一份爱的力量 让我们一起爱到疯狂
把真心真意交给对方 不要害怕会受伤
请给我一份爱的力量 让我们一起地老天荒
当真情真爱放出光芒 谁也不能够阻挡 

BOUNCE 
你给你祖妈放的尊重一点

别在那手来脚来 整个人的道德像屎
时不时约会就要滑倒 去踩到香蕉皮 快爬起来 别漏气
最后再苦劝一次 载着女友别飚车
这是什么感觉 怎么这么促咪 
心像火在烧 人在风中飞 你是我生命的能源

请给我一份爱的力量 让我们斗阵爱到疯狂
把真心真意交给对方 不要害怕会受伤
请给我一份爱的力量 让我们斗阵地老天荒
当真情真爱放出光芒 连妳老爸都没办法挡 

DAMN 我真有影FEEL GOOD 
阮血肉五个人是真正有影将才
阮陪你欢喜 陪妳伤心 陪你走过东西南北 
台湾还有哪 你要我们陪你走

请给我一份爱的力量 让我们一起爱到疯狂
把真心真意交给对方 不要害怕会受伤
请给我一份爱的力量 让我们一起地老天荒
当真情真爱放出光芒 谁也不能够阻挡

,Don't ask me I'll never tell
,I looked to you as it fell
,And now you're in my way
,I'd trade my soul for a wish
,Pennies and dimes for a kiss
,I wasn't looking for this
,But now you're in my way
,Your stare was holding
,Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
,Hot night, wind was blowin'
,Where you think you're going baby?

,Can't get to me at all
,
,Up here in the cold thin air

,They didn't even make a sound
,I found a way to let you in

,Standing in the light of your halo
,I got my angel now
,It's like I've been awakened
,Every rule I had you breaking
,It's the risk that I'm taking
,I ain't never gonna shut you out

,I'm tired of being what you want me to be
,Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
,Don't know what you're expecting of me
,Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,Every step I take is another mistake to you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do
,Is be more like me and be less like you
,Can't you see that you're smothering me
,Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
,Cause everything that you thought I would be
,Has fallen apart right in front of you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,Every step that I take is another mistake to you
,(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
,And every second I waste is more than I can take
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do
,Is be more like me and be less like you
,And I know
,I may end up failing too
,But I know
,You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do
,Is be more like me and be less like you
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

LET ME TAKE A SELFIE LET ME TAKE A SELFIE
,When Jason was at the table
,I kept on seeing him look at me while he was with that other girl
,Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
,Because he was totally texting me all night last night
,and I don't know if it's a booty call or not
,Sooo... like what do you think?
,Did-Did you think that girl was pretty?
,How did that girl even get in here?
,Did you see her?
,She's so short and that dress is so tacky
,Who wears cheetah?
,It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing Summertime Sadness?
,After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
,I really need one
,But first, LET ME TAKE A SELFIE
,Can you guys help me pick a filter?
,I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
,I wanna look tanned
,What should my caption be?
,I want it to be clever
,How about "Livin' with my bitches, Hashtag LIVE"
,I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
,Do you think I should take it down?
,LET ME TAKE ANOTHER SELFIE
,Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
,What a creep
,Is that guy sleeping over there?
,Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
,That's so ratchet..
,That girl is such a fake model
,She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
,Who goes out on Mondays?
,OK, let's go take some shots
,Oh no (uh), I feel like I'm gonna throw up
,Oh wait, nevermind I'm fine
,Let's go dance
,There's no vodka at this table
,Do you know anyone else here?
,Oh my god, Jason just texted me
,Should I go home with him?
,I GUESS I TOOK A GOOD SELFIE

"I'll try," she said as he walked away.
"Try not to lose you."
Two vibrant hearts could change.
Nothing tears the being more than deception,
unmasked fear.
"I'll be here waiting" tested and secure.
Nothing hurts my world,
just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood,
you'll be the one to fall.
"I wish I could be the one,
the one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand,
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me.
When time soaked with blood turns its back,
I know it's hard to fall.
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me."
Nothing will last in this life,
our time is spent constructing,
now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin.
Constrict your hands around me,
squeeze till I cannot breathe,
this air tastes dead inside me,
contribute to our plague.
Break all your promises,
tear down this steadfast wall,
restraints are useless here,
tasting salvation's near.
Nothing hurts my world,
just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood,
you'll be the one to fall.
"I wish I could be the one,
the one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand,
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me.
When time soaked with blood turns its back,
I know it's hard to fall.
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me."

,We held our hearts over the flame
,We couldn't help but call it treason
,And after that we couldn't fill our frames.

,And standing fast,We'd radiate
,A light we loved but never named
,but the answers never came.
,Our shadows never,Looked the same.

,We are the ones who lost our faith
,Of everything we swore we never would forget.

With the power of hatred
I will crash the heaven
And rape the sacred

Unbridled rage is the final dimension
Take back what was taken
Burn the world
For all crimes forsaken

As I rock, rock, rock the microphone
We are beyond the time of correction
A rebuild now could only
Follow destruction
The system cannot be reformed
The structure will never
Transform by itself
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome
As I rock, rock, rock, rock the microphone
Yeah, straight from the top of my dome

,On the vault of winter skies
,The ancient call for the snow
,And the rune for the blazing ice
,Pouring tears of the weeping maiden
,Staining the dress of the virgin white
,Leaves the deepest kind of yearning
,In the chains of the northern lights
,Like a moth in the darkness
,Through the flare of the charm
,And the first winter storm
,Where the frozen leaves are falling
,And the light gives up to shades
,Sweet touch of the mother nature
,Seals up all in rest
,In the arms of the darkest season
,Sleeps away the flame of the day
,Joins the dance of December

,I hear the silent whispers,
,Darkness still upon me,
,All those empty words
,from the buried heart
,I don ’t know where fear ends
,and where hate begins,
,It ’s all the same to me,
,Life is falling apart
,Hand in hand …side by side
,I walk with fate in the night
,The red fluid of life is flowing right along my arms,
,I feel the sweet blade diving deep inside,
,This moment I ’ve been waiting for so long a time,
,when I know the last cut will be for my life
,I ’ve looked through the eyes of pain
,and seen the smile of death
,I ’ve wandered in the shadows of my fears
,The feathers of a white dove
,were stained by darkened tears
,The final tune is soon to be played
,Hand in hand …side by side
,I walk with death in the night

,Is this what we need to breathe

,I'm open with an empty heart

,And we shall grieve until we start

,Why there's a hunger that we can't satisfy

An endless descent into my personal darkness
Longing for nonexistence, slowly holding my breath
Down down down – So fucked up and so careless
Feeling so close to the end of this journey into cold death
Deprive me – Pave the way for my demise
Deprive me – I will miss the morning rise
Deprive me – Cut me down, close my eyes
Deprive me – To deny the gift of life
This torment so tempting, the path of the joyless
I took all my love and turned it into my own curse
Rape my innocence, rip me apart, leave me heartless
The only place I fit in is into my own hearse
Deprive me – Pave the way for my demise
Deprive me – I will miss the morning rise
Deprive me – Cut me down, close my eyes
Deprive me – To deny the gift of life
Deprived
Useless strains of sorry lies
Worthless days, worthless nights
Deprive me – Kill my chances to survive
Deprive me – Through black waters let me dive
Deprive me – Waste my will to be alive
Deprive me – Take away what I despise

Thought I dreamed it again, the place where 
I constantly wander 
So far and wrapped in darkness 
It stands as the incarnation of my obsessions 
My soul is keaving my body once more 
As I enter those wretched ancient walls 
Corridors of post-mortem existence 
I breathe the evilness of dark deserted rooms 
Tears falling from my eyes as 
I walk towars the stairs 
Haunted by something 
I can't perceive 
A house built on my utter negativity 
Last visions of a fullmoon, the frozen nighttime wind 
I lose myself through those endless dungeons 
Take me away, take me there where 
I'm born Embrace me in your inhuman angst 
The smell of distant places in my dreams 
Nostalgia, take me home...

,I only need to watch these fifty wounds
,I opened upon my body in the night

,And cry for joy when you'll be here again

,Sweet women' faces twisted and mutilated
,Tied to a rope in the dark of these rooms

,You don't exist, you never existed
,Our art is made of gore and entrails
,Paintings of cruelty to design your unexisting lives
,Your breath is dying out frame after frame
,This movie is no more blue
,We painted blue with black and flesh with blood-red
,You suffer your hell on Earth
,To jerk-off as they cut you to pieces
,To zoom on your agonizing desperate eyes
,To stare your now eternal looks of terror
,Your lives never meant anything to us
,To look at your empty faces dressing your own dead-skin masks
,To think of your dreams we butchered at birth
,No one is innocent
,No one is innocent

,I always know what you're gonna say
,I know you'll always criticize
,And put the spikes into my eyes
,Get out of here
,Don't hold me down
,Get out of here
,I ain't gonna come around
,You think I'm crazy
,You can make me lost and found
,I ain't no fool
,You know what I'm looking for
,Life's a bitch
,Life's a bitch
,Life's a bitch
,I swear to God, I got the seven year itch
,Don't you make no moves on me
,Put me in jail or set me free
,I know you always let me down
,I'm gonna leave you, leave this town
,Get out of here, 'cause I don't care
,Get out of here
,I don't think you pay your share

,-Lookin' for love
,-That they never will get
,Sitting in the dark just feeling low
,I'm ruined to the heart - I'm on the road
,To nowhere - to nowhere
,If you wanna lie to me again
,There is a rotten place they call the end
,Just go there - and stay there
,Liar (Oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh)
,You took a quick escape
,But left your lies in perfect shape
,As long as my memories live
,I never will forgive you
,-So if we meet somewhere tonight
,-You'd better be set to fight
,-In the darkness of missing stars
,-You won't see me

,And let me dance along, until the lights are on
,
,You leave me once again home alone
,The fridge is full but my heart is achin'
,You think i can make it on my own
,Just a kiss and you are gone
,Another night like a million before
,Another party where i'm not invited
,As always you'll heat the dance floor
,In front of your turntables going mad
,Why don't you keep me close to you
,I'm not anymore the kid you knew
,Why should i stay deep in the blue
,I wanna move my body too

,We've been aside since i meant to be
,A part of you that was just awaking
,My life with you is a fantasy
,I am your prince and you are my king
,You say your thing drives sometimes you insane
,You think you're no good father and so you're ashamed
,But all i want is to share your pain
,Clubbin' the night along and having fun
,Why don't you keep me close to you
,I'm not anymore the kid you knew
,Why should i stay deep in the blue
,I wanna move my body too

,One Two Three Go!
,워워워~~~ 워워워~~~
,나를 포기했어 너만 사랑했어
,그것만으로도 부족했었나
,바보 같은 내게 내게 이럴 수 있어
,영원히 함께 있자고 죽어도 같이 죽자고
,눈물로써 맹세했는데 다 필요 없어
,너의 행복 찾아 나를 떠난다면
,이제 와서 나는 어떡하라고
,다시 생각해봐 내게 이러면 안돼
,너 없인 살 수가 없어 제발 날 도와 달라고
,애원하며 붙잡고 싶어
,워워워~~~ 워워워~~~
,어느날 갑자기 슬픈 내게로 다가와
,사랑만 주고서 멀리 떠나가 버린 너
,get down and find yo cutie
,jump around and shake yo booty
,이해 못해 너의 그런 의미
,why me 진정 나를 사랑했니
,heart breakin', love rackin'
,너에게 모든 걸 맡긴, now you packin'
,왜 착한 나를 자꾸 울려
,don't wanna let's you go!
,사랑하면 뭐해 정은 줘서 뭐해
,순정 바쳐 고작 눈물뿐인데
,사랑한게 죄야 너를 원망 않겠어
,나 떠나 행복하기를 간절히 기도할께요
,단 내 사랑은 잊지 말아줘
,워워워~~~ 워워워~~~
,어느날 갑자기 슬픈 내게로 다가와
,사랑만 주고서 멀리 떠나가 버린 너
Stupid words, every day
Again and again I hear them say
Leave me alone, can't take anymore
I'm not the saint you're looking for
You'll never chain me to your head
I'm not your dog, I don't play dead
I'll never let you get me down
Don't tell me
I can't have another drink
Don't tell me
Who to hang around with
Now I am
Tired of your misery
Leave me alone
You better leave me alone
We are young, we are free
We are your catastrophy
And your ordinary Sunday
Is our neverending funday
We are young, we are free
And change the world's philosophy
And your ordinary Sunday
Is our neverending funday
Got my hair, cut to the brain
But look mum and dad I'm still the same
Don't you see, I'm not like you
And all your polititians too
You'll never chain me to your head
I'm not your dog, I don't play that
I'll never let you get me down
Don't tell me
I can't have another drink
Don't tell me
Who to hang around with
Now I am
Tired of your misery
Leave me alone
You better leave me alone
We are young, we are free
We are your catastrophy
And your ordinary Sunday
Is our neverending funday
We are young, we are free
And change the world's philosophy
And your ordinary Sunday
Is our neverending funday

灭神除魔三生诺；
天定孽缘轮回劫，
来世只为指尖扣。
