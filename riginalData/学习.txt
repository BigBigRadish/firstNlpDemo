,ich schleich mich an die Mama ran
,und zeig ihr wie ich schnappen kann
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,
,ich bin Schnappi das kleine Krokodil
,und vom schnappen da krieg ich nicht zuviel
,ich beiss den Papi kurz ins Bein
,und dann dann schlafe ich einfach ein
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,schni schna schnappi schnappi schnappi schnapp
,
,把你捧在手上 虔诚地焚香
,剪下一段烛光 将经纶点亮
,不求荡气回肠 只求爱一场
,爱到最后受了伤 哭得好绝望
,我用尽一生一世 来将你供养
,只期盼你停住 流转的目光
,请赐予我无限爱 与被爱的力量
,让我能安心在菩提下 静静的观想
,把你放在心上 合起了手掌
,默默乞求上苍 指引我方向
,不求地久天长 只求在身旁
,累了醉倒温柔乡 轻轻地梵唱
,我用尽一生一世 来将你供养
,只期盼你停住 流转的目光
,请赐予我无限爱 与被爱的力量
,让我能安心在菩提下 静静的观想
,我用尽一生一世 来将你供养
,人世间有太多的 烦恼忧伤
,苦海中飘荡着你 那旧时的模样
,一回头发现 早已踏出了红尘万丈

雨，在想你的深夜淅沥
早莺新燕也开始回忆
那些轻的重的远的近的声音
越来越甜蜜

风，在梦你的黎明停息
锦花绣草也露出笑意
这些明的暗的虚的实的画面
越来越清晰

水光潋滟晴方好，山色空濛雨亦奇
吴侬软语，眉目传情，心有灵犀
欲把西湖比西子，淡妆浓抹总相宜
古往今来，天上人间，你是最美的传奇

君问归期未有期
巴山夜雨涨秋池

,臣亮言：
,先帝创业未半，
,而中道崩殂。
,今天下三分，益州疲弊，
,此诚危急存亡之秋也。
,然侍卫之臣，不懈于内；
,忠志之士，忘身于外者，
,盖追先帝之殊遇，
,欲报之于陛下也。
,诚宜开张圣听，
,以光先帝遗德，
,恢弘志士之气；
,不宜妄自菲薄，
,引喻失义，
,以塞忠谏之路也。
,宫中府中，俱为一体，
,陟罚臧否，不宜异同。
,若有作奸犯科，及为忠善者，
,宜付有司，论其刑赏，
,以昭陛下平明之治；
,不宜偏私，使内外异法也。
,
,侍中、侍郎郭攸之、费依、董允等，
,此皆良实，志虑忠纯，
,是以先帝简拔以遗陛下。
,愚以为宫中之事，事无大小，
,悉以咨之，然后施行，
,必得裨补阙漏，有所广益。
,将军向宠，性行淑均，晓畅军事，
,试用之于昔日，
,先帝称之曰“能”，
,是以众议举宠为督：
,愚以为营中之事，悉以咨之，
,必能使行阵和睦，优劣得所也。
,亲贤臣，远小人，
,此先汉所以兴隆也；
,亲小人，远贤臣，
,此后汉所以倾颓也。
,先帝在时，每与臣论此事，
,未尝不叹息痛恨于桓、灵也！
,侍中、尚书、长史、参军，
,此悉贞亮死节之臣也，
,愿陛下亲之、信之，
,则汉室之隆，可计日而待也。
,♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪
,臣本布衣，躬耕于南阳，
,苟全性命于乱世，
,不求闻达于诸侯。
,先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，
,三顾臣于草庐之中，
,谘臣以当世之事，由是感激，
,遂许先帝以驱驰。
,后值倾覆，受任于败军之际，
,奉命于危难之间：
,尔来二十有一年矣。
,先帝知臣谨慎，
,故临崩寄臣以大事也。
,受命以来，夙夜忧虑，
,恐付托不效，以伤先帝之明。
,故五月渡泸，深入不毛。
,今南方已定，兵甲已足，
,当奖帅三军，北定中原，
,庶竭驽钝，攘除奸凶，
,兴复汉室，还于旧都；
,此臣所以报先帝而忠陛下之职分也。
,至于斟酌损益，进尽忠言，
,则攸之、依、允等之任也。
,愿陛下托臣以讨贼兴复之效，
,不效，则治臣之罪，以告先帝之灵。
,若无兴德之言，
,则责攸之、依、允等之慢，
,以彰其咎。
,陛下亦宜自课，
,以谘诹善道，察纳雅言，
,深追先帝遗诏。
,臣不胜受恩感激！
,今当远离，临表涕泣，不知所云。

,길냥이 마냥 구석진 곳으로 날 옮겨
,사실은 말야 오늘 네 생각 참 많이 났어
,걷다가 말야 지난 추억들 자꾸 떠올라서
,무던히 평범한 그저 그런 날일 뿐인데
,뭐 땜에 깊은 곳을 찔러 너라는 먹먹함
,소박히 손잡고 걸었던 그날로 돌아가고 싶어

,There comes a time when the blank,
,the blankness of future is so extreme,
,it is such a black wall of nothingness,
,not even of bad things,
,it’s not like there's a cave full of monsters
,that you are afraid of entering, the future.
,It’s just nothingness.
,The néant as the French would say.
,Le vide, the void, the emptiness
,and it is …uh... just horrible.
,Help,I have done it again
,And,the worst part is there's no one else to blame
,Be my friend
,Hold me,wrap me up
,Unfold me
,I am small
,I'm needy
,Warm me up
,And breathe me
,It’s horrible to contemplate a futureless future,
,if that isn’t too impossible.
,And so you just want to step out of it.
,To step out of the whole race, the whole business.
,The monstrosity of being alive overwhelms you.
,And be my friend
,Hold me, wrap me up
,Unfold me

,Are you shining just for me?

,There's so much that I can't see
,Who knows?
,I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
,That now our dreams
,They've finally come true
,
,City of stars
,Just one thing everybody wants
,There in the bars
,And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
,It's love
,Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
,A rush
,A glance
,A touch
,A dance
,
,To look in somebody's eyes
,To light up the skies
,To open the world and send them reeling
,A voice that says, I'll be here
,And you'll be alright
,I don't care if I know
,Just where I will go
,'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
,A rat-tat-tat on my heart…

,Think I want it to stay
,City of stars
,Are you shining just for me?
,City of stars
,You never shined so brightly
,I walk a lonely road
,The only one that I have ever known
,Don't know where it goes
,But it's home to me and I walk alone
,
,I walk this empty street
,On the Boulevard of broken dreams
,Where the city sleeps
,And I'm the only one and I walk alone
,I walk alone I walk alone
,I walk alone and I walk a-
,
,My shadows the only one that walks beside me
,My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating
,Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
,'Till then I'll walk alone
,
,Ah..ah..
,
,I'm walking down the line
,That divides me somewhere in my mind
,On the border line of the edge
,And where I walk alone
,
,Read between the lines
,What's fucked up and everything's alright
,Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
,And I walk alone
,I walk alone I walk alone
,I walk alone and I walk a-
,
,My shadows the only one that walks beside me
,My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating

,Summer in the hills
,Those hazy days I do remember
,We were running still
,Had the whole world at our feet
,Watching seasons change
,Our roads were lined with adventure
,Mountains in the way
,Couldn't keep us from the sea
,Here we stand open arms
,This is home where we are
,Ever strong in the world that we made
,I still hear you in the breeze
,See your shadows in the trees
,Holding on, memories never change

,You may say you're walking all by yourself
,Have no one else

,Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
,Drifting throught the wind
,Wanting to start again?
,Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
,Like a house of cards
,One blow from caving in?
,Do you ever feel already buried deep
,Six feet under scream
,But no one seems to hear a thing
,Do you know that tehre's still a chance for you
,Cause there's a spark in you
,You just gotta ignite the light
,And let it shine
,Just own the night
,Like the Fourth of July
,Cause baby you're a firework
,Come on show 'em what your worth
,Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
,As you shoot across the sky-y-y
,Baby you're a firework
,Come on let your colors burst
,Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
,You're gunna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own
,You don't have to feel like a waste of space
,You're original, cannot be replaced
,If you only knew what the future holds
,After a hurricane comes a rainbow
,Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
,So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
,Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
,And when it's time, you'll know
,You just gotta ignite the light
,And let it shine
,Just own the night
,Like the Fourth of July

,In the spring we made a boat
,out of feathers, out of bones.
,We set fire to our homes,
,walking barefoot in the snow.
,Distant rhythm of the drum
,as we drifted towards the storm.
,Baby lion lost his teeth,
,now they're swimming in the sea.
,
,Troubled spirits on my chest
,where they laid to rest.
,The birds all left my tall friend
,as your body hit the sand.
,Million stars up in the sky
,formed a tigers eye
,
,that looked down on my face,
,out of time and out of place.
,So hold on,
,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,
,Awaken by the sound
,of a screaming owl.
,Chasing leafs in the wind,
,going where we've never been.
,Said goodbye to you my friend,
,as the fire spread.
,All that's left are your bones
,that will soon sink like stones
,So hold on,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.

,The life you chose -
,There's never a list for it
,Of cons and pros
,You find what you love, and you commit
,
,And you're looking so far down
,The road so well
,That you could forget your crown
,Isn't just somewhere else
,
,You get bumped and bruised and worse
,For choosing the road less traveled
,You know the reward is rich
,If you persist through the darkest battles
,Open your eyes,
,Your prize is right before you, somehow
,Whatever you do, just don't miss now
,
,You're on a bus
,Don't notice the miles and months fly by
,To the rest of us
,You're living the highest kind of life
,
,And though the price you pay
,Is costlier than it seems
,It's worth another day
,The end justifies your means
,
,All that you're working for
,Could blind you to the treasures all around you
,So don't miss these moments, please
,The joy before the crown you seek

,Counting up the years
,Steady hands' just take the wheel
,And every glance is killing me
,Time to make one last appeal
,For the life I lead
,Stop and stare
,I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
,Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
,But I've become what I can't be
,Oh'Stop and stare
,You start to wonder why you're here not there
,And you'd give anything to get what's fair
,But fair ain't what you really need
,Oh' can you see what I see
,They're trying to come back
,All my senses push
,Un-tie the weight bags
,Sometimes now I never thought I could
,Steady feet' don't fail me now
,I'm Gonna run till you can't walk
,But something pulls my focus out
,And I'm standing down
,Stop and stare
,I think I'm moving but I go nowhere

,
,I wasted, wasted love for you
,trading out for something new

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
,Somebody that you used to know
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,you didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,somebody I used to know
,Hey Jude' don't make it bad.
,Take a sad song and make it better.
,Remember to let her into your heart'
,Then you can start to make it better.
,Hey Jude' don't be afraid.
,You were made to go out and get her.
,The minute you let her under your skin'
,Then you begin to make it better.
,And anytime you feel the pain' hey Jude' refrain'
,Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
,For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
,By making his world a little colder.
,Hey Jude' don't let me down.
,You have found her' now go and get her.
,Remember to let her into your heart'
,Then you can start to make it better.
,So let it out and let it in' hey Jude' begin'
,You're waiting for someone to perform with.
,And don't you know that it's just you' hey Jude' you'll do'
,The movement you need is on your shoulder.
,Hey Jude' don't make it bad.
,Take a sad song and make it better.
,Remember to let her under your skin'
,Then you'll begin to make it

,The last that ever she saw him,

,carried away by a moonlight shadow,
,Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
,far away on the other side,
,he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight,

,carried away by a moonlight shadow,
,Sing the song of sorrow and grieving,
,carried away by a moonlight shadow,
,All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
,far away on the other side,
,He was shot six times by a man on the run,
,and she couldn't find how to push through.
,I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,
,I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day.
,
,Four a.m. in the morning,
,carried away by a moonlight shadow,
,I watched your vision forming,
,carried away by a moonlight shadow,
,Stars moving in silvery night,
,far away on the other side,
,Will you come to talk to me this night,
,but she couldn't find how to push through.
,I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven far away,
,I stay, I pray, I see you in heaven one day.

,With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
,Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing, but all you are is mean

PICKERING: Higgins, forgive the bluntness,
But if I'm to be in this business
I shall feel responsible for the girl.
I hope it's clearly understood
that no advantage is to be taken of her position.
PROF. HIGGINS. What! That thing? Sacred, I assure you.
PICKERING. Come now, Higgins, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?
PROF. HIGGINS: Have you ever met a man of good character
where women are concerned?
PICKERING. Yes, very frequently.
PROF. HIGGINS. Well, I haven't.
I find that the moment I let any woman make friends with me,
She becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious, and a damned nuisance.
And I find that the moment that I make friends with a woman,
I become selfish and tyrannical.
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain so.
Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than just an ordinary chance,
To live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I,
Of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
Doing whatever he thinks is best for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...
BUT, let a woman in your life
And your serenity is through,
She'll redecorate your home,
From the cellar to the dome,
And then go to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...
Let a woman in your life,
And you're up against a wall,
Make a plan and you will find,
She has something else in mind,
And so rather than do either
You do something else that neither likes at all.
You want to talk of Keats or Milton,
She only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet,
And spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life
And you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands
For those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling
Than to ever let a woman in my life.
I'm a very gentle man,
Even-tempered and good-natured
Whom you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I,
Down to my fingertips,
The sort who never could, ever would,
Let an insulting remark escape his lips.
A very gentle man...
BUT, let a woman in your life,
And patience hasn't got a chance.
She will beg you for advice,
Your reply will be concise,
And she'll listen very nicely,
And go out and do precisely what she wants!
You are a man of grace and polish
Who never spoke above a hush,
Now all at once you're using language
That would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life,
And you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex,
Tie the knot around their necks,
I'd prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition
Than to ever let a woman in my life.
I'm a quiet living man,
Who prefers to spend the evenings
In the silence of his room,
Who likes an atmosphere as restful
As an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I,
Of philosophic joys,
Who likes to meditate, comtemplate,
Free from humanity's mad inhuman noise;
A quiet living man...
BUT, let a woman in your life,
And your sabbatical is through,
In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends,
Come to jabber, and to chatter,
And to tell her what the matter is with YOU!
She'll have a booming boisterous family,
Who will descend on you en mass,
She'll have a large wagnerian mother,
With a voice that shatters glass.
Let a woman in your life,
Let a woman in your life,
I shall never let a woman in my life.

Ladies and Gentlemen
Ev'ry duke and earl and peer is here
Ev'ryone who should be here is here.
What a smashing, positively dashing
Spectacle: the Ascot op'ning day.
At the gate are all the horses
Waiting for the cue to fly away.
What a gripping, absolutely ripping
Moment at the Ascot op'ning day.
Pulses rushing! Faces flushing!
Heartbeats speed up! I have never been so keyed up!
And second now They'll begin to run. Hark!
A bell is ringing, They are springing Forward Look!
It has begun...! What a frenzied moment that was!
Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling Running of the
Ascot op'ning race.

Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

Diamonds are forever
Hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me

I don't need love
For what good will love do me
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll lustre on

Diamonds are forever
Sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not
Worth going to your grave for

I don't need love
For what good will love do me
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll lustre on

Dimaonds are forever, forever, forever
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Forever and forever........

,I made London into an island for a number of reasons.
,Britain is an island. It's a collection of islands.
,It informs our national psyche.
,It's a wry joke on, on London's self-importance.
,The Isle of Woking, dormitory island town.
,It's an image of, of both order and chaos,
,and, at times, an image of where the order descends into chaos,
,making it, I was trying to say how bewildering it can be,
,sometimes, to live in the place.
,The infinite amounts of stories and lives and,
,and histories that, you know, ten million people in a city experience.
,
,London has burned many times across the centuries.
,Its day of judgement revisited again and again.
,All over the Thames with one's face in the wind,
,you were almost burned with a shower of fire drops.
,Above 10,000 houses all in one flame.'
,the noise and crackling and thunder of the impetuous flames.'
,the shrieking of women and children,
,the hurry of people, the fall of towers,
,houses and churches was like a hideous storm
,The Great Fire Of London burned for seven days.
,The ruins resembling the picture of Troy.
,Over 13,000 buildings were destroyed.
,It was the calamity of the age,
,but the smouldering hole at the heart of the city would prove to be a huge inspiration.
,Plans were drawn up to bring a new order of beauty to London.
Rotten meat, rotten meat, yeah. I don't like dead rats. I don't mind live ones. Something about dead rats, I don't know why. I hope he's not doing what I think he is, otherwise I'll have to go and to arrest him. Well, there's a good chance that is probably urine, yeah. You can always tell if it's in a corner, you know what I mean. If it's hidden away in a corner, that urine, you know what I mean? That, I would imagine.....I should say it's Coca Cola. I remember once a girl was so sick walking through, she was so bad, she kept getting sick. I said, "Hang on a minute, darling. Wait a minute."And I gave her a bag. I said, "You do the rest." Yeah, blood was actually found somewhere around here. He's having an argument with his girlfriend, he broke a bottle and stabbed himself and got up and walked off. It's mayhem, you know, some really good punch-ups, you know what I mean, and then they just go home. They let off steam and I come here the next morning and try to work out what it was, who won. you know what I mean? 腐肉味，腐肉味，没错。我不喜欢死老鼠，活着的倒无所谓，就是不喜欢死老鼠，我也不知道为什么。我希望他不是在做我心里想的那件事，否则我就得去逮捕他了，那可能是尿。总有人在角落里不守规矩，要是藏在角落里，可能就是尿。那个，我觉得是应该是可乐。我记得有次一个姑娘从里这走过，她恶心得厉害，一直想吐。我说"坚持住，等一下"。然后给了她一个袋子，然后说"你吐吧"。这附近真的有过血迹，一个人在这里跟女朋友吵架，他把瓶子摔破猛扎自己，然后站起来就走了，简直一片狼藉。还有在街上斗殴的，打完就回家了，他们在这儿打完，我第二天早上过来，然后猜到底出了什么事，谁打赢了。你明白我的意思吧。 贺加斯是第一位，把伦敦街头当作剧院的艺术家。街上的污垢和废墟，奇人和异事共同述说着一个特别的故事。这座城市街头的肮脏氛围，此后便成为艺术家灵感的来源。 And it's fun because you're watching other people's behaviour. Cos it's such a job, it gets into your blood. People will tell you that, you know. This and the refuge, it gets inside you. It's inside you. You find it hard to do anything else. 观察别人的一举一动是一件趣事，这样的工作会成为你生命的一部分。大家都这么跟你说，这个还有庇护所，成为你的一部分，与你融为一体 很难再去做别的事情。与你融为一体，很难再去做别的事情。
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the season of light, it was the season of darkness. It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of sadness. It was the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy－five.
In France there was a King and a Queen, and in England there was a King and a Queen. They believed that nothing would ever change. But in France things were bad, and getting worse. The people were poor, hungry and unhappy. The King made paper money and spent it, and the people had nothing to eat. Behind closed doors in the homes of the people, voices spoke in whispers against the King and his noblemen；they were only whispers, but they were the angry whispers of desperate people.
Late one November night, in that same year 1775, a coach going from London to Dover, stopped at the top of a long hill. The horses were tired, but as they rested, the driver heard an other horse coming fast up the hill behind them. The rider stopped his horse beside the coach and shouted：
'I want a passenger, Mr Jarvis Lorry, from Tellson's Bank in London.'
'I am Mr Jarvis Lorry, ' said one of the passengers, putting his head out of the window.'What do you want?'
'It's me！Jerry, Jerry Cruncher, from Tellson's Bank, sir, ' cried the man on the horse.
'What's the matter, Jerry?' called Mr Lorry.
A message for you, Mr Lorry. You've got to wait at Dover for a young lady.'
'Very well, Jerry, ' said Mr Lorry.'Tell them my answer is CAME BACK TO LIFE'.
It was a strange message, and a stranger answer. No one in the coach understood what they meant.
The next day Mr Lorry was sitting in his hotel in Dover when a young lady arrived. She was pretty, with golden hair and blue eyes, and Mr Lorry remembered a small child, almost a baby. He had carried her in his arms when he came from Calais to Dover, from France to England, many years ago. Mr Lorry asked the young lady to sit down.
'Miss Manette, ' he said.'I have a strange story to tell you, about one of the customers of Tellson's Bank. That's where I work.'
'Yes, but I don't quite understand, Mr Lorry, ' said the young lady.'I received a message from Tellson's Bank, asking me to come here to meet you. I understood there was some news about my poor father's money. He died so long ago—before I was born. What is this story you want to tell me?'
'About twenty years ago, Miss Manette, a French doctor married an English lady. They had a daughter, but just before she was born, her father disappeared. Nobody knew what had happened to him. Not long afterwards his unhappy wife died, and their daughter was brought back to England.'
'But this is like my father's story, Mr Lorry. And wasn't it you who brought me back to England?'
'Yes, that's true, Miss Manette. Many years ago I brought you from France to England, and Tellson's Bank has taken care of you since then. You were told that your father had died. But think, Miss Manette. Perhaps your father wasn't dead. Perhaps he was in prison. Not because he had done something wrong！ But just because he had a powerful enemy—an enemy with the power to send him to prison and to keep him there, hidden and forgotten, for eighteen years！'
'Can it be true? Is it possible that my father is still alive?' Lucie Manette stared at Mr Lorry. Her face was white and her hands trembled.'It will be his ghost—not him！'
'No, Miss Manette, ' said Mr Lorry gently.'He is alive, but he has changed very much. Even his name had been forgotten！And we must ask no questions about the past, no questions at all. It would be too dangerous. He has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there to bring him back to life.'
13 The last goodbyes
  At that same hour in the early afternoon a coach going out of Paris drives up to the gates of the city.
  'Who goes there? Show us your papers！'The guard looks at the papers. 'Alexandre Manette, Doctor. Which is he? '
  This is Dr Manette；this helpless old man, whispering crazily to himself.
  'The last few days of the Revolution have been too much for him, 'said the guard with a cruel laugh. 'Lucie his daughter. The wife of Evrémonde. Which is she? '
  This is she. With her child, little Lucie, beside her.
  'Hah, your husband has another meeting today. Sydney Carton. Lawyer, English. Which is he? '
  He is here, in the corner. He is not well.
  'And Jarvis Lorry. Banker, English. Which is he? '
  'I am he, and the last, 'says Jarvis Lorry.
  'Here are your papers, Jarvis Lorry. You may go. '
  There are wildly beating hearts in the coach, and trembling hands；there is the heavy breathing of the unconscious traveller. But onwards the coach goes；the horses are fast, and there are no shouts behind them on the road.
  Also that afternoon Madame Defarge was talking with her friends.
  'My husband is a good citizen, but he is not strong enough. He feels sorry for the Doctor. I say that all the Evrémonde people must go to the Guillotine. The wife and the child must follow the husband. '
  'They're both fine heads for the Guillotine, 'said Jacques Three. 'Their heads will be a pretty sight when they are shown to the people. Yes, they too, must die. '
  'But I'm afraid that my husband may warn them and let them escape, 'Madame Defarge went on, 'and I must do something myself. After the death of Evrémonde at three this afternoon we'll go to the Tribunal and accuse them. '
  The others agreed willingly. 'No one must escape. More heads must fall. '
  'Lucie Manette will be at home now, waiting for the moment of her husband's death, 'said Madame Defarge. ' I will go to her. She will say things against the Revolution, and condemn herself. Here, take my knitting and keep my usual seat near the Guillotine. '
  'Don't be late, 'said her friend.
  'To see the death of Evrémonde, I shall not be late, 'replid the cruel voice of Madame Defarge.
  There were many women in Paris at that time who hated the nobles and wanted to see them die. But of all these women, Madame Defarge was the one most feared. All her life she had been filled with hate. It was nothing to her that an innocent man was going to die because of his father's and his uncle's crimes. She wanted more. Hidden in her clothes were a gun and a sharp knife, and with her usual confident step, she began to walk to Dr Manette's house.
  The house was not yet empty. Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher were there, preparing to follow Mr Lorry's coach. Mr Lorry had decided that two coaches were better than one；with fewer passengers, each coach would travel faster. But Miss Pross was still worried. A second coach leaving from the house might suggest an escape.
  'Mr Cruncher, 'she said, 'you must go and stop our coach coming here. Drive to the church instead, and I'll meet you there at three o'clock. '
  Jerry hurried away. It was twenty past two, and at once Miss Pross began to get herself ready to leave. She was washing her face when she suddenly looked up and saw a figure standing in the room.
  Madame Defarge looked at her coldly. 'The wife of Evrémonde；where is she? '
  Miss Pross quickly stood in front of the door to Lucie's room. 'You're a cruel, dangerous woman, but you won't frighten me, 'she said, breathing hard.
  Each woman spoke in her own language, and neither understood the other's words. But Madame Defarge knew that Miss Pross was a true friend of the Doctor's family, and Miss Pross knew that Madame Defarge was the family's enemy.
  'I wish to see the wife of Evrémonde. Go and tell her. Do you hear me? 'said Madame Defarge. She stared angrily at Miss Pross, but Miss Pross stared back just as angrily.
  'I am desperate, 'said Miss Pross. 'I know that the longer I can keep you here, the greater hope there is for my darling girl. If you fight me, I'll fight back！'
  Madame Defarge stepped forward and called loudly, 'Citizen Doctor！Wife of Evrémonde！Answer me！'
  There was no answer and Madame Defarge quickly opened three of the doors and saw that the rooms were empty. One door was still closed.
  'If they are not in that room, they are gone. But they can be followed and brought back. 'She went towards the door, but Miss Pross jumped forward and held her round the waist. Madame Defarge was used to the fighting in the streets and was strong, but love is stronger than hate and Miss Pross did not let go. Madame Defarge tried to pull out her knife.
  'No, 'said Miss Pross, 'it's under my arm. You shall not have it. '
  Madame Defarge put her hand to the front of her dress and began to pull out the gun. Miss Pross looked down, saw what it was, and hit out at it wildly. There was a loud bang, and a cloud of smoke, and Miss Pross stood alone, trembling with terror.
  All this in a second. As the smoke cleared, Miss Pross saw the lifeless body of Madame Defarge on the ground. In horror, she opened her mouth to call for help, but then she thought of the dangers this would bring for her dear Lucie. With shaking hands, she got her hat and coat, locked the door of the room, and went downstairs. As she crossed the bridge on the way to the church, she dropped the key of the locked room in the river and hurried on to meet Jerry Cruncher.
  * * *
  As the death－carts carry the condemned prisoners through the streets of Paris, crowds watch to see the faces of those who are to die. In the chairs around the Guillotine, the friends of Madame Defarge are waiting for her. 'Teresa, Teresa Defarge！Who has seen her? She's never missed before！'
  But the death－carts have arrived, and the Guillotine has already begun its work. Crash！—A head is held up, and the women who sit knitting count One.
  The supposed Evrémode helps the young girl down from the cart. He carefully places her with her back to the Guillotine, and she looks up gratefully into his face.
  Because of you, dear stranger, I am calm. I think you were sent to me by God, 'she whispers.
  'Or perhaps He sent you to me, 'says Sydney Carton. 'Keep your eyes on me, dear child, and do not think of anything else. '
  'I do not mind while I hold your hand. I shall not mind when I let it go, if they are quick. '
  'They are quick. Fear not！'
  She kisses his lips；he kisses hers. Now the Guillotine is waiting. The young girl goes next, before him. The women count Twenty－Two, and Carton walks forward.
  Twenty-Three.
  They said of him that it was the most peaceful face ever seen there What passed through Sydney Carton's mind as he walked those last steps to his death? Perhaps he saw into the future…
  'I see Barsad, Defarge, the judges, all dying under this terrible machine. I see a beautiful city being built in this terrible place. I see that new people will live here, in real freedom. I see the lives for whom I give my life, happy and peaceful in that England which I shall never see again. I see Lucie when she is old, crying for me on this day every year, and I know that she and her husband remember me until their deaths. I see their son, who has my name, now a man. I see him become a famous lawyer and make my name famous by his work. I hear him tell his son my story.
  'It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done；it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known. '

,
,The Bennets'new neighbour
,It is a truth well known to all the world that an unmarried man in possession of a large fortune must be in need of a wife． And when such a man moves into a neighbourhood， even if nothing is known about his feelings or opinions， this truth is so clear to the surrounding families，that they think of him immediately as the future husband of one or other of their daughters．
,‘My dear Mr Bennet，’said Mrs Bennet to her husband one day，‘have you heard that someone is going to rent Netherfield Park at last？’
,‘No，Mrs Bennet，I haven't，’said her husband．
,‘Don't you want to know who is renting it？’cried Mrs Bennet impatiently．
,‘You want to tell me，and I don't mind listening．’
,Mrs Bennet needed no further encouragement．‘Well，my dear， I hear that he's a very rich young man from the north of England．It seems he came to see Netherfield on Monday and was so delighted with it that he arranged to rent it at once．Of course，it is the finest house in the area，with the largest gar- dens． His servants will be here by the end of the week， and he will be arriving soon afterwards！’
,‘What is his name？’asked Mr Bennet．
,‘Bingley．’
,‘Is he married or single？’
,‘Oh， single， my dear，of course！A single man of large for- tune—he has an income of four or five thousand pounds a year．How wonderdul for our girls！’
,‘Why？ How can it affect them？’Mr Bennet asked．
,‘My dear Mr Bennet，’she replied，‘how can you be so an- noying！You must realize I'm thinking of his marrying one of our daughters．’
,‘Is that his purpose in coming to the area？’
,‘His purpose？No， of course not． But it's very likely that he’ll fall in love with one of them．And I want him to see the girls as soon as possible，before our other neighbours introduce themselves． So you must visit him as soon as he arrives．’
,‘I really don't see why I should，’said Mr Bennet．‘You and the girls can visit him， or perhaps you should send them by themselves．Yes， that might be better， as you're as attractive as any of them， and Mr Bingley might like you best．’
,‘My dear， you flatter me，’replied his wife，‘I certainly have been called beautiful in the past， but I think a woman with five adult daughters should stop thinking of her own beauty．Mr Bennet，I beg you to visit him．You know it's cor- rect for the gentleman of the family to visit new neighbours first．I simply cannot take the girls to see him unless you have already met him．’
,‘Surely you worry too much about the rules of polite society． I'm sure Mr Bingley will be delighted to see you all．And I’ll write him a few lines，which you can give him， agree- ing gladly to his marrying any of the girls， although I must es- pecially recommend my dear little Lizzy．’
,‘Oh no， Mr Bennet！’gasped Mrs Bennet， horrified．‘Please don't do that！And Lizzy is no better than the others，al- though I know she is your favourite．’
,‘Our daughters are all very silly，ignorant girls， it's true．But at least Lizzy is a little more intelligent than her sisters．’
,‘Mr Bennet， how can you speak so unkindly of your own children？ Oh dear，how ill I feel！ Have you no pity for me？Don't you realize how I suffer？’
,‘Indeed，my dear， I've suffered with you for the last twentythree years．But I think you will recover， and live to see many more rich young men come into the neighbourhood．’
,When he was young， Mr Bennet had made the mistake of falling in love with a pretty but foolish young woman．During the long years of their marriage， he had had time to regret his mistake．He soon realized that his wife had little intelligence or common sense， and was only interested in talking， shopping and finding husbands for her daughters．His experience had made him rather bitter， and he could not stop himself mocking his wife， who never understood her husband's sense of humour．
,So when， a week later， Mrs Bennet discovered that her hus- band had in fact visited Mr Bingley at Netherfield， she was surprised and very pleased．But she and her daughters tried in vain to persuade Mr Bennet to describe the wealthy stranger，and in the end they had to rely on another neighbour's description．⊂↹⊃
,‘He sounds wonderful，Mama！’cried Lydia，the youngest and noisiest of the sisters．‘Charlotte Lucas's father has been to see him， and says he's quite young， very handsome， and ex- tremely charming！And even better，he loves dancing！Every- body knows that means he's very likely to fall in love！’
,As politeness required， Mr Bingley came to visit Mr Bennet a few days later． He was not， however， fortunate enough to see the Bennet girls， who were hiding behind the curtains in an up- stairs room in order to catch sight of the handsome stranger．Mrs Bennet planned to invite him to dinner， but in fact they met him at another social event first．The Bennets lived in the small Hertfordshire village of Longbourn，and public dances were regularly held in the nearest town， Meryton．The girls were greatly looking forward to this particular dance， because they had heard that Mr Bingley would be attending， with a group of friends from London．
,On the night of the dance， all eyes were on Mr Bingley as he entered the room． He had brought his two sisters， with the husband of the elder， Mr Hurst， and another young man，Mr- Darcy．Mr Bingley was indeed good-looking and gentleman- like， and his sisters were fine， fashionable women．However， ev- erybody was soon talking about Mr Darcy， a tall， handsome man， who，it was said， had an income of ten thousand pounds a year．The ladies in the room gazed at him in admiration for about half the evening， until they became aware of his constant frown and his unwillingness to talk or dance． Then there was general agreement that he was proud and disagreeable， and considered himself superior to country people．Mr Bingley， on the other hand，made himself popular with the ladles by danc- ing every dance and talking to everybody．
,As there were not as many gentlemen as ladies， Elizabeth Bennet did not have a partner for one of the dances， and was sitting watching the dancing．Mr Darcy was standing near her，and when Mr Bingley came up to speak to his friend，Elizabeth could not avoid hearing their conversation．
,‘Come， Darcy，’said Bingley，‘I hate to see you looking so cross！Why don't you dance with one of these lovely girls？’
,‘Certainly not，’replied Darcy．‘You know how I hate dancing with a partner I don't know．I would particularly dis- like it at a village dance like this．Apart from your sisters，there isn't a woman in the room I would even consider dancing with． You are dancing with the only attractive girl here．’He was looking at Mrs Bennet's eldest daughter Jane， who was waiting for Bingley to join her for the next dance．
,‘Oh yes！She's the most beautiful creature I've ever seen！But just behind you is one of her sisters．She's very pretty，and I'm sure she's very pleasant．My partner could introduce you．’
,‘Who do you mean？’And Darcy turned to look at Elizabeth for a moment．‘No，’he said coldly，‘she's not attractive enough to tempt me．Go back to your partner， Bingley．’
,This conversation did not endear Mr Darcy to Elizabeth， but she told the story very cheerfully and amusingly to her friends．
,The evening passed very happily for everybody else， and Mrs Bennet was delighted with the effect her eldest daughter had had on Mr Bingley．
,‘He danced with Jane twice！’she told her husband later．‘He danced with all the others only once！And he really is so handsome！But his friend Mr Darcy was so rude to poor Eliza- beth！ Luckily，she doesn't care！She wouldn't want to please him！Such a horrible，proud man！I simply hate him！’
,When Jane and Elizabeth were alone，they discussed their dancing partners．
,‘I was really very flattered when Mr Bingley asked me to dance a second time！’said Jane， blushing．‘I didn't expect it at all！’
,‘Didn't you？’said Elizabeth．‘I did．Dear Jane！ You were five times prettier than any other woman in the room， but you're too modest ever to expect admiration．’
,‘I have to admit that I liked Mr Bingley，’continued Jane in her gentle voice．‘He's so good-mannered and agreeable！’
,‘He's also handsome，’added her sister，‘which makes his character quite perfect！But what did you think of his sisters？’
,‘Very pleasant when you get to know them． The younger，Miss Caroline Bingley，will be living at Netherfield with her brother． I'm sure we’ll enjoy having her as a neighbour．’
,Elizabeth listened in silence．She was not convinced．‘Jane is so kind！’she thought．‘Always ready to see the good side of people's characters！I considered Mr Bingley's sisters too proud， almost rude， in fact．I'm sure they feel superior to most other people，like Mr Darcy．’But she did not say any more．
,After the dance the Bennet and Bingley families began to visit each other every few days．It became evident that Mr Bingley admired Jane very much， and Elizabeth knew that her sister was close to falling in love with him． She was discussing this with her good friend，Charlotte Lucas， one day Charlotte was a sensible， intelligent young woman of twenty-seven， the eldest daughter of Sir William and Lady Lucas， who were neighbours of the Bennet family．
,‘It's a good thing，’said Elizabeth，‘that if Jane is in love with Mr Bingley，nobody will know，because she always be- haves so cheerfully and normally．’
,‘That's sometimes a mistake，’replied Charlotte， shaking her head wisely．‘If she doesn't show her feelings at all，even to the man she loves， she may lose the opportunity of catching him．Jane should use every moment she gets with Bingley to attract and encourage him．’
,‘But I consider a man should try to discover a woman's feelings，not wait for her encouragement！ And Jane probably doesn't know what her real feelings for Bingley are yet—she has only seen him a few times，not often enough to understand his character， or be sure that she really loves him．’
,‘Well， I wish Jane success with all my heart，’said Char- lotte finally，‘but I think she'd have as much chance of happi- ness if she married him tomorrow， as if she studied his charac- ter for a whole year． Happiness in marriage is simply a question of chance． I think it's better to know as little as possible about the person you're going to spend your life with．’
,Elizabeth laughed， sure that Charlotte did not mean what she was saying．
,While observing Mr Bingley's interest in Jane，however，Elizabeth had not noticed Mr Darcy's interest in herself．Al- though at first he had not even considered her pretty， he now began to realize what a beautiful expression her dark eyes gave to her intelligent face， and what an attractive figure she had．‘Of course， she is only an unfashionable village girl，’he told himself， but her conversation is often quite amusing．’When- ever they met， he did not speak to her， but stood near her， lis- tening to her and watching her closely， conscious of a wish to know her better．
,One evening at a party at the Lucases’house， Darcy was standing alone， as usual， away from the other guests， watching the dancing． His host， Sir William，came to speak to him．
,‘Mr Darcy！ Are you enjoying the dancing，sir？ What a de- lightful entertainment it is！’
,Darcy frowned．‘Yes，’he said with cool disdain，‘it's something that any uneducated person can be good at．’
,‘I'm sure you're good at dancing yourself， sir，’replied Sir William cheerfully．‘Look！Here's Miss Elizabeth Bennet．’She was crossing the room at that moment．‘Let me persuade you to dance with her．You cannot refuse to dance when so much beauty is in front of you．’
,‘Indeed， sir，’replied Elizabeth quickly， in some embarrass- ment， ‘I have no intention of dancing． You must excuse me．’
,‘Miss Bennet，please allow me the pleasure of dancing with you，’said Mr Darcy politely，holding out his hand．⊂↹⊃“
,But with equal politeness Elizabeth refused again，and turned away．Mr Darcy was watching her walk away，with a slight smile on his face， when Caroline Bingley came up to him．
,‘Mr Darcy，’she said，‘I'm sure I know what you're thinking—how boring all these silly little country people are！’⊂↹⊃“
,‘Not at all，Miss Bingley．In fact，I was just thinking what pleasure a pair of fine eyes can give．’
,‘Really！And who do these fine eyes belong to，may I ask？’
,‘Miss Elizabeth Bennet．’
,‘Well！Let me be the first to congratulate you，Mr Darcy！When will the wedding be？’
,‘Ah！That's what I expected you to say．A lady's imagina- tion jumps from admiration， to love， to marriage， in a moment．’
,‘Well， of course， when you're married， you will often have her charming mother and sisters to stay． How delightful for you！’
,And Miss Bingley， seeing that Darcy remained calm，continued to mock the Bennet family as amusingly as she could．
,
,Mr Collins visits Longbourn
,‘I hope，my dear，’said Mr Bennet to his wife at break- fast the next morning，‘that you have told the cook to send up a good dinner today，as I am expecting a visitor．
,‘Who is it， my dear？ I know of nobody who is coming， un- less Charlotte Lucas happens to call in， and I hope my dinners are good enough for her．’
,‘The person I'm talking about is a gentleman and a stranger．’
,Mrs Bennet's eyes shone with excitement．‘It's Mr Bingley，I'm sure！ Why，Jane，you never mentioned it！Well，I’ll be extremely glad to see him． Lydia， my love，ring the bell．I must speak to the cook at once．’
,‘It is not Mr Bingley，’said her husband．‘It's a person whom I have never seen before．’
,This caused general astonishment， and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters all at the same time． Having amused himself for some time with their curiosity，he finally explained．‘I have recently received a letter from my cousin，Mr Collins，who，as you know，will inherit all my property when I die， and may throw you out of this house as soon as he wants．’
,‘Oh， my dear！’cried his wife．‘Please don't mention that hateful man． It's the hardest thing in the world to accept the fact that your property is not left to your own children， and I'm sure， if I were you， I'd have tried to do something about it．’
,Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain the legal situation to her again．They had often attempted to do this before．But it was a matter which Mrs Bennet refused to understand， and she con- tinued to complain bitterly about Mr Collins．
,‘It certainly is most unjust，’agreed Mr Bennet，‘and noth- ing can clear Mr Collins from the guilt of inheriting this house．But if you listen while I read his letter to you，you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself．’
,He read aloud the following letter：
,Dear Sir，
,The disagreement between you and my late respected fa- ther always worried me， and since his death I have frequently wished to improve the relationship between our families．
,After a long period of study and training I have recently become a priest，and have been fortunate enough to gain the patron- age of Lady Catherine de Bourgh， widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh．
,This generous lady has given me the post of rector at Hunsford， which was luckily vacant．Hunsford is the village near her own large country house in Kent．Here I carry out the duties of my profession whenever necessary， and I take great care to behave at all times with grateful respect towards her ladyship．
,As a priest，moreover， I feel it my duty to encourage all families in my area of influence to live peacefully．Because of this，I flatter myself that I am acting correctly in offering you my friendship．
,I am of course concerned that when I even- tually inherit all your property， your daughters will doubtless be very poor，and I do apologize for this．I promise you I am ready to make amends in every possible way—but more about this later．If you do not object， I propose to visit you and your family on Monday November 18th，at four o’clock， and shall probably stay until the following Saturday week．
,This will cause me no inconvenience at all，as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence from my duties．
,I remain，dear sir，with respectful good wishes to your lady and your daughters， your friend， William Collins．
,‘So we can expect this peace-making gentleman at four o’clock today，’said Mr Bennet，as he folded up the letter．‘He appears to be a most polite and serious young man．How considerate of Lady Catherine to allow him to visit us！’
,‘Well，if he is ready to make amends to the girls in some way， I shall certainly not discourage him，’said Mrs Bennet．
,‘Although it's difficult，’said Jane，‘to guess how he in- tends to do that，it's good of him to want to help us．
,‘I think he's peculiar，’said Elizabeth．‘He sounds too pleased with himself，and he speaks so politely of Lady Cather- ine！And why does he apologize for inheriting Father's prop- erty in future？ We know it's not his fault．Can he be a sensible man，sir？’she added，turning to Mr Bennet．
,‘No， my dear， I think not．I have great hopes of finding him quite the opposite．There is a mixture of servility and self- importance in his letter， which promises to be entertaining．I am impatient to see him．’
,Mary，the middle daughter， who spent most of her time reading and who seldom joined in family conversations， now re- marked that in her opinion his letter was well expressed．
,But Kitty and Lydia did not show any interest in the letter or its writer．As it was highly unlikely that their cousin would arrive in a regimental uniform， they could not imagine having any pleasure in meeting him．
,Their mother， however， had changed her attitude towards Mr Collins after his letter， and was now preparing to meet him with such calmness that it astonished her husband and daughters．
,Mr Collins arrived punctually， and was received with great politeness by the whole family． Mr Bennet indeed said little，but the ladies were ready enough to talk， and Mr Collins did not seem in need of encouragement．He was a tall， heavy- looking young man of twenty-five．
,His expression was serious，and his manners very formal．Soon after his arrival， he said to Mrs Bennet，‘Madam， I must compliment you on having such a fine family of daughters． I had heard much of their beauty， but I find them even more beautiful than reports have stated．I do not doubt you will see them all well married quite soon．’
,Mrs Bennet never quarrelled with compliments，and she answered，‘You're very kind，sir，and indeed I do hope so，be-cause otherwise they’ll have nothing at all to live on．’
,‘You refer perhaps to my inheriting the Bennet property？’
,‘Ah，yes，sir，I do！You must confess it is a sad business for my poor girls．’
,‘I am very aware，madam，of the hardship to your lovely daughters—and could say more about this，but I am cautious of saying too much too soon．But I would like to say that I have come prepared to admire the young ladies．And perhaps when we know each other better—’
,The bell rang for dinner，and the family moved into the dining-room with their guest．The girls smiled secretly at each other，as Mr Collins praised the hall，the dining-room and all the furniture．Mrs Bennet would normally have been delighted with such praise，but she could not help thinking that he was perhaps admiring it all as his future property．
,The dinner，too， he considered excellent，and he asked which of his charming cousins was responsible for it．But Mrs Bennet explained quite sharply to him that they were very well able to afford a good cook，and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen． He begged her pardon immediately for offending her，and con- tinned to apologize for about a quarter of an hour．
,Mr Bennet had hardly spoken up to now，but he thought it was time to enter the conversation．‘You seem very fortunate in your patron，Mr Collins，’he said．
,He could not have chosen a better opening remark．Mr Collins spoke enthusiastically for several minutes in praise of Lady Catherine．‘Never in my life have I witnessed such con- siderate behaviour in a person of high birth！
,Although she is such a great lady，she has never treated me with disdain．She talks to me almost as an equal，and gives me advice．For exam- ple，she has recommended me to marry as soon as possible．And do you know，she has asked me to dinner twice at her house！
,Some people consider her proud，but she has only ever been kind to me．She even took the trouble to visit my small house， and was thoughtful enough to suggest one or two improve- ments—some shelves upstairs．’
,‘That is very correct and polite，I'm sure，’said Mrs Bennet．‘Does she live near you，sir？’
,‘Only a small country road separates my poor house from Rosings Park，her ladyship's home．’
,‘I think you said she is a widow？Has she any family？’
,‘She has only one daughter，who will inherit Rosings and all Lady Catherine's property．A most charming young lady，un- fortunately in weak health．
,I often pay her some little compli- ment on her appearance or her accomplishments when I visit Rosings．Lady Catherine appreciates these compliments to her daughter，and I see it as my duty to please her ladyship．’
,‘I am sure you're right，’said Mr Bennet．‘No doubt you are expert at flattering with delicacy．May I ask how you think of these pleasing compliments？’
,‘Some of them come to me at the time，but in my spare moments I do occasionally prepare a few words which may be suitable for different occasions．’
,Mr Bennet listened to his cousin with the greatest emjoyment．Mr Collins was as foolish as he had hoped．But by tea-time Mr Bennet had had enough，and after tea，asked his guest to read aloud to the ladies．
,However，when a novel was handed to Mr Collins，he looked shocked，and protested that he never read novels．
,He chose a religious book instead，and start- ed reading in a slow，serious voice．Lydia could not hide her boredom for long，and after only three pages she interrupted him rudely，to ask her mother a question about one of the offi- cers in Meryton Mr Collins was offended，and refused to read any more，although Mrs Bennet and her other daughters apolo- gized for Lydia's lack of manners．
,Mr Collins was not a sensible man，and neither education nor society had improved him．The respect he felt for his patron， and his very good opinion of himself and his new position， made him proud and servile at the same time．
,Now that he had a home and a considerable income，he had decided to marry.The Bennet girls，who would lose their inheritance because of him，had a reputation for being attractive and charming，and his idea of making amends to them was to marry one of them．
,He considered this an excellent plan，and thought himself ex- tremely generous and unselfish in carrying it out．
,He had known he was right when he arrived at Longbourn and saw Jane Bennet's lovely face．As the eldest，she should marry first，and for the first evening she was his choice．
,But the next morning，after a fifteen-minute conversation with Mrs Bennet，he had to change his mind．When he explained that he was hoping to find a wife among her daughters，she replied， with a happy smile，that her eldest daughter was very likely to be engaged soon．‘But there are my other daughters，Mr Collins，’she continued，encouragingly．
,Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth，and it was soon done—done while Mrs Bennet was pouring the tea． Next to Jane in birth and beauty，Elizabeth was the obvious choice．
,Mr Bennet was delighted，hoping that she might soon have two daughters married．The man whom she had so disliked the day before was now a favourite with her．
During the week before the regiment's departure， all the young ladies in the Meryton area became extremely de-pressed．Only the two elder Miss Bennets were still able to eat，drink， sleep and lead a normal life．They were often scolded by Kitty and Lydia， who could not understand such hard-heartedness．
‘How shall we manage without the officers！’ they cried miserably．‘How can you smile like that，Lizzy？’
Their affectionate mother shared all their sadness．‘I re－member when Colonel Millar's regiment went away， twenty-five years ago，’she said，‘I thought my heart was broken．’
‘I'm sure mine will be broken，’said Lydia．
‘If we could only go to Brighton！’said Mrs Bennet．‘I'm certain a little sea－bathing would be good for me．’
‘Oh yes！ But Papa is so disagreeable about it．’
Elizabeth tried not to listen， but could not help seeing the justice of Darcy's objections to her family．
But soon Lydia's bitterness changed to absolute delight，when she received an invitation from Colonel Forster's wife， to accompany her to Brighton with the regiment． Mrs Forster was a very young woman， only recently married， and as cheerful and sociable as Lydia， witn whom she had been friendly for two months． Poor Kitty was very upset at not being included in the invitation， but Lydia cared nothing for her sister's feelings． She ran wildly through the house， calling for everyone's congratulations， and laughing and talking more loudly than ever．
Elizabeth could not share her sister's happiness， and felt it was her duty to advise her father secretly to refuse permission for Lydia to go．But she could not convince him that Lydia would be in any real danger， and so all the arrangements were made for her sister's departure． Elizabeth thought her father was wrong，however， and was still worried about how Lydia would behave in an atmosphere of greater freedom， and among the temptations of a fashionable seaside town like Brighton．
Elizabeth had seen Mr Wickham regularly since her return from Kent， at family parties and visits． She no longer thought him so agreeable． As the rich Miss King had left Meryton to stay with her uncle， Mr Wickham appeared eager to transfer his affections back to Elizabeth． His confidence in his own charm and ability to please annoyed Elizabeth very much， so that when she met him for the last time before the regiment’ s departure， she spoke quite coldly to him． In reply to a polite question of his about her Hunsford visit， she could not stop herself mentioning her frequent meetings with Mr Darcy， and her favourable opinion of that gentleman's character． Wickham looked a little embarrassed，and made no further attempt to charm Elizabeth．They separated at last with mutual politeness， and possibly a mutual desire never to meet again．
When Lydia left for Brighton， Elizabeth had to put up with Mrs Bennet's and Kitty's constant complaints that Longbourn had become very dull． Fortunately， she was able to look for-ward to a trip which she would soon be taking with Mr and Mrs Gardiner．They had planned to visit the Lake District，but Mrs Gardiner had recently written to say that as her husband's business made it necessary to shorten their holiday to three weeks， they would not have time to visit the whole of the Lake District comfortably．Instead，she suggested visiting Derbyshire， an area with a particularly strong attraction for her， as she had spent a large part of her early life there．Eliza-beth was disappointed， but accepted the new plan at once．Al-though it was impossible to hear of Derbyshire without think－ing of Pemberley and its owner， she felt sure she could avoid meeting Mr Darcy there．
Four weeks later， Mr and Mrs Gardiner arrived at Long-bourn，where they had arranged to leave their children in Jane's care．The next day they set out with Elizabeth on their journey．The three of them made excellent travelling compan－ions，sharing an intelligent interest in the people and places they saw on their way， and a strong affection for each other．After visiting Oxford， Blenheim， Warwick， Kenilworth and Birmingham， they arrived in Derbyshire， and decided to stay in the small town of Lambton， where Mrs Gardiner had lived be-fore her marriage． Elizabeth discovered that Mr Darcy's house，Pemberley，was only eight kilometres away from Lambton．
‘I often used to go to Pemberley when I was younger，’said Mrs Gardiner．‘Wouldn't you like to see it，Lizzy？ We could go tomorrow．It's a beautiful place．Wickham spent his youth there， you know．’
‘I—I am rather tired of large country houses，aunt，’said Elizabeth，forced to pretend．How dreadful it would be to meet Mr Darcy， while viewing his house！But when she asked a servant at the hotel one or two careful questions that evening， she was told that Mr Darcy was not at home at the moment．Greatly relieved， she felt able to agree to her aunt's sugges-tion， when it was repeated the next morning， and Mr Gardiner ordered a carriage immediately．
In a short time they entered the gates of Pemberley park，and drove through an extensive and beautiful wood．At the top of a hill they had their first view of Pemberley House，situated on the other side of a valley， with a line of high， wooded hills behind． The house was a large，handsome， stone building，which appeared to fit naturally into the scenery．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were warm in their admiration， and Elizabeth was de-lighted．At that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pember－ley might be worthwhile！
They drove up to the front door， and asked to be allowed to visit the house．The Pemberley housekeeper，a respectable，el－derly woman，showed them round．All the rooms were of a good size， and elegantly yet sensibly furnished．From every window there was an attractive view．Elizabeth began to admire the owner's taste in everything she saw．
‘And I might have been mistress of this place！’she thought．‘Instead of viewing these rooms as a stranger， I might be welcoming my uncle and aunt as visitors．But no，’she sud－denly remembered， ‘that could never be．I wouldn't have been able to invite my uncle and aunt，or any other of my vulgar family connections．’This was a lucky thought， which saved her from something like regret．
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her mas-ter were really absent， but luckily her uncle asked the question instead．It was quite alarming to hear that Mr Darcy was ex－pected to arrive the next day， with a large group of friends．How glad Elizabeth was that their own journey had not been delayed a day！
Mr and Mrs Gardiner were enjoying their conversation with the housekeeper， who seemed content to talk about her master．
‘Mr Darcy is a very handsome gentleman， as you will see from the painting upstairs．His sister is most attractive too，and so accomplished！She plays and sings the whole day．My master has just sent a new piano from London for her． He's such a kind brother，he’ll do anything for Miss Georgiana．’
‘Does Mr Darcy spend much time at Pemberley？’asked Mr Gardiner．
‘Not as much as I'd like， sir．’
‘If your master married，he might spend more time here！’
‘Yes，sir， but I don't know when that’ll be． I don't know who is good enough for him．’Mr and Mrs Gardiner smiled，and Elizabeth listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper continued．‘It's no more than the truth．Every-body who knows him says the same． He's never spoken a cross word to me， and I've known him since he was a baby． Some people call him proud， but I've never seen any of that． He's the best master that ever lived．’
Elizabeth almost stared at her．‘Can this be Mr Darcy？’she wondered．This was the most extraordinary praise for the man she had always thought so disagreeable and proud， especially with people he considered inferior to himself．She longed to hear more， but now the housekeeper was leading them upstairs．Soon Elizabeth found herself in front of the painting of Mr Darcy．He was smiling at her， just as she remembered him smiling sometimes when he looked at her． She looked at the picture silently for several minutes before going downstairs with the others．At that moment Elizabeth certainly felt more warmly towards Mr Darcy than at any time since their first meeting．She was beginning to realize that she had underestimated his character． His housekeeper's opinion of him was totally favourable， and what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant？ As she stood in front of his picture， she gratefully remembered the warmth of his feelings for her， and began to forget the way in which he had expressed them．
As they had now seen all the rooms which were open to the public， the housekeeper called the gardener， who was going to show them the park and gardens．They were just walking away from the house， when Elizabeth turned to have one last look，and saw the owner of Pemberley come suddenly forward from behind the house．
They were within twenty metres of each other， and Eliza-beth could not avoid his seeing her．Their eyes instantly met，and they both blushed． He appeared very surprised， but， recov-ering quickly，approached and spoke to Elizabeth，if not calmly， at least with perfect politeness． Astonished and con-fused，she received his greetings with embarrassment．Soon he could find no more to say， and left her to return to the house．Mr and Mrs Gardiner， who had been watching from a distance， expressed their admiration of his appearance， but Eliz-abeth could only think of her feelings． How unfortunate that she had come！She blushed again．It might seem as if she had planned this meeting with him．And his behaviour was so different！ Never before had she heard him speak so politely and so gently．What could it mean？
Her head full of these thoughts， she joined her uncle and aunt in their walk through the gardens．They were walking slowly beside an attractive stream， when they noticed Mr Dar-cy coming towards them． This time Elizabeth was able to con-trol herself better， and she returned his greetings politely． She hid a smile when he asked her to do him the honour of intro－ducing him to her friends， as she felt sure he was not expecting the well－mannered Gardiners to be some of her low－born rela－tions．He certainly seemed surprised when she introduced her uncle and aunt， but took care to talk for some time to Mr Gar－diner， with every appearance of interest．Elizabeth was delight－ed that these relations，at least，could not be criticized for their poor behaviour or lack of intelligence．On their way back to the house，Mr Darcy walked beside Elizabeth．There was a short si-lence before she spoke．
‘Your housekeeper informed us you would not arrive until tomorrow，so I had not expected to find you here．’
‘It is true．I came early on business．The rest of the party will be here tomorrow．Among them are Mr Bingley and his sisters， whom you know．’He continued after a pause，‘And there is one other person who particularly wishes to meet you．Will you allow me，or do I ask too much， to introduce my sister to you？’
Surprised but flattered by this great compliment，Elizabeth gave her permission． When they arrived at the house， Mr Darcy offered them some refreshment，but they politely refused．Mr Darcy helped the ladies into the carriage，and as it drove away from Pemberley，Elizabeth watched him walking slowly back towards the house．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were loud in their praise of him， but Elizabeth said very little．
The very next morning Mr Darcy brought his sister to visit Elizabeth and the Gardiners at the hotel in Lambton．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were astonished by the honour they were receiving， but Elizabeth's obvious embarrassment， and Darcy's haste in making the visit so immediately， soon provided them with an explanation．They observed their niece and Darcy care－fully during the visit， and could not doubt that the gentleman was in love， although they were not certain of the lady's feel－ings．
Elizabeth was delighted to discover that Georgiana Darcy，far from being proud，as Wickham had said，was just very shy，with quiet，gentle manners．It was clear that she greatly ad－mired her brother，and had every intention of liking Miss Ben－net，as Darcy had spoken of her so favourably．Elizabeth was al-so satisfied to see that Bingley，who was with the Darcys，did not seem particularly interested in Georgiana， in spite of Caro－line Bingley's wishes．And she had to admit that she had never seen Mr Darcy behaving so sociably and pleasantly，not only to herself， but also to the relations to whom he had referred with such disdain during that last conversation in Hunsford Rectory．Elizabeth herself was more than usually anxious to make herself agreeable to everybody， and she succeeded， be－cause Bingley was ready， Georgiana was eager， and Darcy de－termined，to be pleased．
Miss Darcy， encouraged by her brother， invited Elizabeth and the Gardiners to dinner at Pemberley in two days'time，and when this invitation had been accepted， the Darcys and Mr Bingley left， with many warm expressions of politeness on both sides．Mr and Mrs Gardiner were very curious about their niece's feelings for Mr Darcy， but were careful not to question her．
That evening Elizabeth lay awake for two whole hours，try－ing to understand how she felt about him．She now thought of him with respect and a certain admiration， and was deeply grateful to him， not only for having once loved her， but for still loving her enough to forgive her bitter rejection of him， as well as all her unjust accusations． The change she had noticed， in a man who was once so proud，must be caused by his love for her．Now， since she was almost sure that if she wanted，she could encourage him to propose to her again， she only had to decide how far she wished to be involved in his future happiness，in which she already felt a real interest．

,All the black guys rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
,Yellin' "Nigga this" and "Nigga that"
,Call everybody "Nigga" and get a nigga mad
,As soon as I say "Nigga" then everyone react
,And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
,Well pound that then
,Talkin' about slavery like you was around back then
,Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
,Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
,A'ight, look
,I see a black man aimin' his gun
,But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
,And I don't mean just for one day and you done
,I mean, you still trapped in a rut
,And I work my ass off and I pay my taxes for what?
,So you can keep livin' off free government assistance?
,Food stamps for your children
,But you're still tryna sell 'em
,For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter
,While you party on the road
,'Cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
,You already late
,You motherfuckas needa get your damn priorities straight
,Wait, it's like you're proud to be fake
,But you lazy as fuck and you'd rather sell drugs
,Than get a job and be straight
,And then you turn around and complain
,About the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face!
,You can't escape problems
,You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
,Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
,"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
,My voice been back
,I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
,I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy
,Got a brother and his girlfriend's black
,My head's in the cloud
,Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
,Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
,Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
,I'm not racist, and I never lie
,But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
,But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my god!
,And all you care about is rappin'
,And stuntin' and bein ratchet
,And that's the nigga within you
,Music rotting your brain and slowly start to convince you
,Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
,Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
,Blame it on everybody except for your own race
,Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
,And just blame it on white citizens
,Same with the vice president
,Bunch of class clowns
,Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
,How dare you try to make demands for this money?
,You gon' show us some respect
,You gon' stand for this country, nigg-er!
,I'm not racist
,I'm just prepared for this type of war
,I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
,Y'all can take that motherfucker too
,He ain't white no more
,It's like you wanna be so famous
,You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
,I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
,Pants hangin' off your ass
,You ain't got no home trainin'?
,Put your fuckin' pants up, nigga!
,Put that suit back on!
,Take that du-rag off! Take that gold out your mouth!
,Quit the pitiful stuff
,And then maybe police would stop killin' you fucks
,Yo, what the fuck?! I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But split into two floors
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story
,I wish that I knew yours
,I wish that I knew yours
,I'm not racist, I swear
,With all disrespect
,I don't really like you white motherfuckers
,That's just where I'm at
,Screaming "All Lives Matter"
,Is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
,And that's one war you'll never win
,The power in the word "Nigga" is a different sin
,We shouldn't say it but we do, and that just what it is
,But that don't mean that you can say it
,Just 'cause you got nigga friends
,Nigga, that word was originated for you to keep us under
,And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
,And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
,And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
,That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
,My grandmomma was a slave, that shit gets to me
,And you ain't got no motherfucking sympathy, you pussy nigga!
,I'm sorry you can never feel my life
,Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
,It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
,Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
,Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
,Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
,You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
,Don't talk about no motherfucking taxes
,When I ain't making no dough
,You think you know everything but you don't
,You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
,Tryna steal black culture and then make it your own, whoa
,Fuck, I'm exhausted
,I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
,I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
,All you do is false shit
,This the shit that I'm forced with
,And you don't know shit about my people
,That's what bothers you
,You don't know about no fried chicken and no barbeque
,You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
,You don't know about no 2 Chainz
,Or no Kool-Aid, you don't know!
,And even though Barack was half as black
,You hated president Obama, I know that's a fact
,You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
,And then you gave us Donald Trump
,And now it's payback for that
,I'm not racist, I never lied
,But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
,Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
,He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died
,Nigga, die nigga!
,And all you care about is money and power
,And being ugly and that's the cracker within you
,Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
,And then you teach it to your children
,Until the cycle continue
,Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
,Blame it on everybody, except for your own race
,Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
,Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent
,But, I might be any day now
,Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
,I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
,And now I'm duckin' everytime
,I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
,You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
,When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
,'Cause even though he's white
,He let us know he standin' with us
,I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
,You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
,You don't know what it's like to mind your business
,And get stopped by the cops and not know
,If you 'bout to die or not
,You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
,I love you but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
,I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
,So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
,I'm not racist
,It's like we livin' in the same buildin'
,But splittin' the both sides
,I'm not racist
,But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
,Can't erase the scars with a bandage
,I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
,Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
,I'm not racist

,Here`s the point
,If we consider the huge maze of possible universes
,The vast majority will not have conditions hospitable to life
,Or at least to anything remotely akin to life as we know it
,For drastic changes in familiar physics
,This is clear
,If our universe didn`t conform to the rules it does
,life, as we know it, would not exist
,Even rather conservative changes to physics would interfere with the formation of stars
,For example
,Disrupting their ability to act as cosmic furnaces
,That synthesize complex life-supporting atoms
,Such as carbon and oxygen
,That normally are spewed throughout the universe
,By supernova explosions
,In the light of the sensitive dependence of life on the details of physics
,If we now ask, for instance
,Why the forces and particles of nature have the particular properties we observe
,A possible answer emerges
,Across the entire gamut of possibilities
,These features vary widely
,Properties could be different
,What`s special about the particular combination of particle and force properties we observe
,Is that clearly they allow life to form
,And life, intelligent life in particular
,Is a prerequisite even to ask the question of why our universe
,Has the properties it does
,In plain language
,Things are the way they are
,Because if they weren`t
,We wouldn`t be here to notice
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see
,The lack of politics and factories
,The gods at stake
,The myopic view
,Halts suspicion that it just might be true
,Your sense of awe
,Your sense of wonder
,Remains intact in the face of it all
,Perhaps in time
,Someone will listen to this waste of breath
,This lecture on nothing
,If we weren`t here
,There`d be no one to see
,The lack of politics and factories
,The gods at stake

,Songs Title：song for you
,
,So today I wrote a song for you
,Cause a day can get so long
,And I know its hard to make it through
,When you say theres something wrong
,
,So Im trying to put it right
,
,Cause I want to love you with my heart
,All this trying has made me tight
,And I dont know even where to start
,
,Maybe thats a start
,
,Cause you know its a simple game
,
,That you play filling up your head with rain
,And you know you are hiding from your pain
,
,In the way, in the way you say your name
,
,And I see you
,
,Hiding your face in your hands
,
,Flying so you wont land
,
,You think no one understands
,
,No one understands
,
,So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head
,
,And your throat is aching but you swear
,No one hurts you, nothing could be sad
,Anyway youre not here enough to care
,
,And youre so tired you dont sleep at night
,
,As your heart is trying to mend
,You keep it quiet but you think you might
,Disappear before the end
,
,And its strange that you cannot find
,
,Any strength to even try
,To find a voice to speak your mind
,When you do, all you wanna do is cry
,
,Well maybe you should cry
,
,And I see you hiding your face in your hands
,
,Talking bout far-away lands
,
,You think no one understands
,
,Listen to my hands
,
,And all of this life
,
,Moves around you
,
,For all that you claim
,
,Youre standing still
,

듣지 말았어야 할 얘기
오늘 하루쯤은 잊고 나와도 좋았을 전화
말문이 막히는 얘기
어차피 내 마음은 상관 없는 얘기
어떻게 너를 잊을까
잊으려고 애를 써볼까
다시 돌아갈 순 없을까
아무 말도 꺼낼 수가 없었던
우리 마지막 얘기
사랑한다 말을 했을 땐
넌 멈춰버렸고 난 가슴은 터질 듯 했는데
지금 난 멈춰버리고
네 다음 얘기를 기다릴 뿐야
어떻게 너를 잊을까
잊으려고 애를 써볼까
다시 돌아갈 순 없을까
아무 말도 꺼낼 수가 없었던
우리 마지막 얘기
어떻게도 아프기만 한 얘기
그만하자는 그 얘기
멈출 수만 있다면
지울 수만 있다면
다시 돌아간다면
처음 만난 그 날로
어떻게 너를 잊을까
잊으려고 애를 써볼까
다시 돌아갈 순 없을까
입을 막은 채로 눈물 흘리는
믿기 싫은 이야기
어떻게 너를 잊을까
잊으려고 애를 써볼까
다시 돌아갈 순 없을까
여전히 널 사랑하기 때문에
꿈에서라도 믿기 싫은 이야기

, I'm getting high, getting high
, Getting high on humans
, Sitting in the backseat, dead heat summer
, Staring at the ground in a lucid light
, I can feel a heartbeat built like thunder
, Running round my head in a holy fire
, Open up the doors, let me feel that zephyr
, Freshen up the air underneath the streets
, Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
, Don't run, don't hide
, And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
, We're making waves of conversation
, Got a rush of energy
, 'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
, I'm getting high on humans
, 'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
, I'm getting high on humans
, (I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
, (I'm getting high, getting high, getting high on humans)
, Elevate the headstrong dead long halo
, Caught up in our skin, gotta fight the grind
, I can make your day glow sun to rainbow
, Colour in your step, let me lose your mind
, Animate the air with a stone cold question
, Do you have the time? Do you hate your life?
, Now I'm locking eyes with a silent stranger
, Don't run, don't hide
, And I can feel the static rising up and out your mouth
, We're making waves of conversation
, Got a rush of energy
, 'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
, I'm getting high on humans
, 'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
, I'm getting high on humans
, Every time I meet your eyes, I can feel life come alive
, 'Cause I'm getting high, getting high
, I'm getting high on humans
, We ride up, we slide up
, We won't stop, we won't stop
, We ride up, we slide up
, We won't stop, no, we won't stop
, We ride up, we slide up
, We won't stop lighting our minds up
, We ride up, we slide up
, We won't stop lighting our minds up

,《谐》之言曰：
,“鹏之徙于南冥也，水击三千里，

,主人下马客在船， 举酒欲饮无管弦。
,醉不成欢惨将别， 别时茫茫江浸月。
,忽闻水上琵琶声， 主人忘归客不发。
,寻声暗问弹者谁？ 琵琶声停欲语迟。
,【沈谧仁】
,移船相近邀相见， 添酒回灯重开宴。
,千呼万唤始出来， 犹抱琵琶半遮面。
,转轴拨弦三两声， 未成曲调先有情。
,弦弦掩抑声声思， 似诉平生不得志。
,低眉信手续续弹， 说尽心中无限事。
,轻拢慢捻抹复挑， 初为霓裳后六幺。
,【奇然】
,大弦嘈嘈如急雨， 小弦切切如私语。
,嘈嘈切切错杂弹， 大珠小珠落玉盘。

,间关莺语花底滑， 幽咽泉流冰下难。
,冰泉冷涩弦凝绝， 凝绝不通声暂歇。
,别有幽愁暗恨生， 此时无声胜有声。
,银瓶乍破水浆迸， 铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
,曲终收拨当心画， 四弦一声如裂帛。
,东船西舫悄无言， 唯见江心秋月白。

,夜深忽梦少年事， 梦啼妆泪红阑干。

,我闻琵琶已叹息， 又闻此语重唧唧。
,同是天涯沦落人， 相逢何必曾相识！
,我从去年辞帝京， 谪居卧病浔阳城。

,住近湓江地低湿， 黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
,其间旦暮闻何物？ 杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
,【沈谧仁】
,春江花朝秋月夜， 往往取酒还独倾。
,岂无山歌与村笛？ 呕哑嘲哳难为听。
,今夜闻君琵琶语， 如听仙乐耳暂明。

,莫辞更坐弹一曲， 为君翻作《琵琶行》。
,感我此言良久立， 却坐促弦弦转急。

,Many nights we pray
,With no proof anyone could hear
,And our hearts a hopeful song
,We barely understand
,Now we are not afraid
,Although we know there's much to fear
,We were moving mountains long
,Before we know we could
,There can be miracles
,When you believe
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracle
,You can achieve
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,In this time of fear
,When prayer so often proves in vain
,Hope seems like the summer birds
,Too swiftly flown away
,And now I am standing here
,My heart's so full I can't explain
,Seeking faith and speaking words
,I never thought I'd say
,There can be miracles
,When you believe (When you believe)
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracle
,You can achieve (You can achieve)
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,They don't always happen when you ask
,And it's easy to give in to your fear
,But when you're blinded by your pain
,Can't see you way safe through the rain
,Thought of a still resilient voice
,Says love is very near
,There can be miracles (miracles)
,When you believe (When you believe)
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracles
,You can achieve (You can achieve)
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,You will when you believe
,You will when you believe
,Just believe
,Just believe
,You will when you believe

,手のひらで愛を見つめたら
,もっと自由になれる
,伝えたいもっと　限りない想いを
,もう何もかも　失ってもいい

,生まれたら　きっと　それは

,아님 그리 쉽게 나를 버릴까
,억지로 누군가를 사랑하며 또 살아갈까
,별들 사이를 누비고
,내 맘을 노래로 채우고
,Don't leave, let me freez

歌词大意：我们相遇的那天你还惦记么？
别孤单我，来我身边陪伴我
在我心里，你是一枚灿烂的菊花
我可知，咱俩不能在一起
否认咱爱是不你要期待的梦想
你是我的快乐，我的幸福，我的生命
可是你在骗了我

Yalwurmayman|يالۋۇرمايمەن

kildig kaqkuz soygu begimni
yurugumni hasratta daglap

zap kiynaldim hasrat piganda
wapa insap yoqmu jahanda
soygu uqun japalar qaksam
niqun soygum qaldi armanda

wapadar dap oyligan sini
bargan wadag kasimig keni
ixandurup sahta soygugga
amdi daritta qaldurdug mini

seginganda heqbir kalmidig
xunqa koysam kogul barmigid
yalwurmayman katsag yol uquq
jahanda qiz birla sanmidig
Na Jaane Mere Dil Ko Kya Ho Gaya
Abhi To Yahin Tha, Abhi Kho Gaya

Na Jaane Mere Dil Ko Kya Ho Gaya 
Abhi To Yahin Tha, Abhi Kho Gaya
Na Jaane Mere Dil Ko Kya Ho Gaya 
Abhi To Yahin Tha, Abhi Kho Gaya

Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Dildaar Sajna, Hai Yeh Pyaar Sajna

Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Dildaar Sajna, Hai Yeh Pyaar Sajna

Dekha Na Tune Mudke Bhi Peeche
Kuch Der To Main Ruka Tha

Jab Dil Ne Tujhko Rokna Chaaha
Door Tu Jaa Chuka Tha

Hua Kya Na Jaana
Yeh Dil Kyon Deewana

Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Dildaar Sajna, Hai Yeh Pyaar Sajna


Ae Waqt Ruk Jaa, Tham Jaa, Thaher Jaa
Waapas Zara Daud Peeche

Main Chhod Aayi Khud Ko Jahan Pe
Woh Reh Gaya Mod Peeche

Kahan Main Kahan Tu
Yeh Kaisa Hai Jaadu

Arre Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Arre Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko To Pyaar Sajna
Laakh Kar Le Tu Inkaar Sajna
Dildaar Sajna, Hai Yeh Pyaar Sajna

Na Jaane Mere Dil Ko Kya Ho Gaya
Abhi To Yahin Tha, Abhi Kho Gaya Kho Gaya
今天晚上我会睡不着
因为我分手了
你离开我
我很爱你
但你不知道我的爱
我都会想念你的眼睛
心
你不知道了我的心
你都在试我
我不是实验物
我不知道该给谁说我的心事儿
再也不见了
再也梦里见不到她了
都分开了

,这一路上走走停停 顺着少年漂流的痕迹
,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打
,-M-
,短短的路走走停停 也有了几分的距离
,不知抚摸的是故事 还是段心情
,也许期待的不过是 与时间为敌
,再次看到你 微凉晨光里 笑的很甜蜜
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,-=-
,晚风吹起你鬓间的白发 抚平回忆留下的疤 你的眼中 明暗交杂 一笑生花
,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话
,我仍感叹于世界之大 也沉醉于儿时情话 不剩真假 不做挣扎 无谓笑话
,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了
,以爱之名 你还愿意吗

,想杀我？你可以试一试
,一剑，一念！

,有些事绝对不会无趣
,长路漫漫，唯剑作伴
,正义？好个冠冕堂皇之词
,这个故事还没有完结
,逃回你们的暗影吧！忍者

,Do I care if I survive this
,Bury the dead where they're found
,
,In a veil of great surprises
,Hold to my head till I drown
,
,Should I tear my eyes out now
,
,Before I see too much
,
,Should I tear my arms out now
,
,I wanna feel your touch
,
,Should I tear my eyes out now
,
,Everything I see returns to you somehow
,
,Should I tear my heart out now
,

作曲 : 我认识你
送给你
,风流倾江左
,依水起高阁
,渭流拥嘉木
,秋临铜雀台
,雀台深 九重纱幔夜风拂
,迢迢 寒星渡 轻月流云复
,雪欲来 霜晚欺白露
,南柯 一枕闲梦远 草木尽萧疏
,云杳重楼无数
,夜拥三千紫阙孤
,宛转楚腰束 缓歌高阁起缦舞
,风移花影簇 烟笼木乔满江渚
,鸾镜清影顾 岁月忽荒疏啊忽荒疏
,今宵星沉月浮
,听风唳千里荒芜
,远山寒鸦渡 寂寞江天雨暮暮
,风卷沉香逐 几树烟罗低绮户
,一川闲絮 轻散入珠幕
,极目云扬处 秋水长风舒
,Deep in the ocean' dead and cast away
,Where innocence's burn in flames
,A million mile from home' I'm walking ahead
,I'm frozen to the bones' I am...
,A soldier on my own' I don't know the way
,I'm riding up the heights of shame
,I'm waiting for the call' the hand on the chest
,I'm ready for the fight' and fate
,The sound of iron shocks is stuck in my head'
,The thunder of the drums dictates
,The rhythm of the falls' the number of dead's
,The rising of the horns' ahead
,From the dawn of time to the end of days
,I will have to run' away
,I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste
,Of the blood on my lips' again
,This deadly burst of snow is burning my hands'
,I'm frozen to the bones' I am
,A million mile from home' I'm walking away
,I can't remind your eyes' you face
,Screaming your name at the top of my lung
,Doesn't make a change
,But it makes me feel stronger
,I'm finally ready to but may we were both wrong
,It took me a while to realize it's gone and we're done
,I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
,I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
,Don't you worry any more
,It's easier to leave then be left behind
,You know
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,At first I thought, it was just about a dream
,But chain of words leading to a dead end, end
,I sharpen my eyes to make you believe I 'll survive
,You did you good but you killed me inside~ide
,I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
,I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
,Don't you worry any more
,It's easier to leave then be left behind
,You know
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,I'm gonna get superlit
,Only way to get over it
,Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
,I gotta get superlit
,I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
,Only way to get over it, over it
,Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
,I gotta get superlit
,I'm getting superlit on the way to my job
,That used to pay the bills from my car
,That got me the girl that dumped me last month
,And I'm stuck paying her family plan off
,Hold the phone right there, just a minute, man
,You know you can change shit around in a minute, man
,Even though you pushing 'round in that mini van
,When you getting home you know you're gonna get...
,Superlit
,Like you ain't never did before
,I'm talking Netflix and Nutella on the kitchen floor
,And I feel like a got a little luck
,And everything is cool until the sun come up
,And then it's back to reality, the same old tragedies
,Back to my old ways like, "Please, don't be mad at me"
,You know it's just a habit when I hit traffic
,Even bad news got me laughing
,I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
,Only way to get over it, over it
,Now that you've done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
,I gotta get superlit
,It's superlit that you do what you did to me
,Cause after what you did to me I've gotta pretend to be...
,Superlit
,I could be whatever I want
,With whoever I want, do anything that I want
,When I'm superlit
,Breaking down the doritos on my mac and cheese
,In my kitchen with them other recipes
,And wait, superlit
,Negative energy will never get the best of me
,And you'll never get the rest of me now I'm...
,Superlit
,We're gonna get super, superlit
,We're gonna get over, over it
,Now that you've done me dirty
,Now that you've done me dirty
,Now that you've done me dirty
,(Come on)
,Let's all get superlit (hey)
,We're gonna get super, superlit (hey)
,So we can get over, over it (hey)
,So we can get stupid superlit
,Again, and again
,
,It's 3am the phone is ringing
,Won't you come over
,You shower, shave, you comb your hair
,And you'll soon be there
,He's been drinking all night long
,And you're still sober
,He tells you all you wanna hear
,And then takes you to his room
,But take it
,For what it is
,Go on and take it
,For what it isn't
,Take it

,Go on and take it

,Two weeks go by and still no sign
,Why won't he call me
,You cry yourself to sleep one night
,And then the phone will ring
,But take it
,For what it is

,晨早起来冷风吹啊
,小鸟没有飞
,为何不开心
,这瞬间想不起
,神智清醒一点我便想起了你
,你的存在像我脑内沼气
,Da ...
,唔该习惯孤单的我
,也变了无心机
,连换紧衫
,也不小心想起你
,啊哈
,你的影响让我哀伤叹气
,你的存在驱赶新鲜空气
,我常幻想能搬去极地
,但脑海的你会陪我上机
,我决心忘记
,便记不起
,林夕你骗我吧
,决心有用吗
,大雨过后晴天
,到日没的一霎
,我不想跟谁再说话
,构想了多天 细心的对白
,这刻无用 剩下雪白空格
,再过自主的人生
,靠自己 成就更开心
,依附谁也 坠落灰暗
,继续 扮高兴下沉
,朋友说
,我要懂得放下才会有转机
,雨后晴天
,就有清新的空气
,耀眼云边
,有最美丽的银色闪闪大地
,我的存在为了欣赏优美
,存在不是为了吞声忍你
,但我会千般温柔细心deal
,With你

让我轻轻的对着你歌唱
像是吹在草原上的风
只想静静听你呼吸
紧紧拥抱你 到天明
路遥远 我们一起走
我要飞翔在你每个彩色的梦中
陪着你
我从遥远的地方来看你
要说许多的故事给你听
我最喜欢看你胡乱说话的模样
逗我笑
尽管有天我们会变老
老得可能都模糊了眼睛
但是我要写出人间最美丽的歌
送给你
路遥远 我们一起走
我要飞翔在你每个彩色的梦中
对你说 我爱你
WOO......
我不再让你孤单
我的风霜你的单纯
我不再让你孤单
一起走到地老天荒

,空空空空如也
,我懵懵懂懂过了一年
,徘徊在石板路的街边
,曾经笑容灿烂如今却
,空空如也
,一切的星光都已陨灭
,得过且过是我如今速写

,一个人 眺望碧海和蓝天
,在心里面那抹灰就淡一些
,海豚从眼前飞越
,我看见了最阳光的笑脸
,好时光都该被宝贝因为有限
,我学着不去担心得太远
,不计划太多反而能勇敢冒险
,丰富地过每一天快乐地看每一天Wooh
,第一次遇见阴天遮住你侧脸
,有什么故事好想了解
,我感觉我懂你的特别
,你的心有一道墙 但我发现一扇窗
,偶尔透出一丝暖暖的微光
,就算你有一道墙
,我的爱会攀上窗台盛放
,打开窗你会看到悲伤融化

,如果说你是海上的烟火
,我是浪花的泡沫
,某一刻你的光照亮了我
,如果说你是遥远的星河
,耀眼得让人想哭
,我是追逐着你的眼眸
,总在孤单时候眺望夜空
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落边拥有边失去着
,如果说你是夏夜的萤火
,孩子们为你唱歌
,那么我是想要画你的手
,你看我多么渺小一个我
,因为你有梦可做
,也许你不会为我停留
,那就让我站在你的背后
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口

,ふたりの想い出
,かき集めたなら
,また泣けてきちゃう
,寂しさ溢れて
,最後の恋だと信じて願った
,あの日々にウソはなかった
,希望夢明るい未来
,東京に持った大きな期待
,だけど現実は甘くなくて
,落ち葉見つめ深く思いつめてた
,そんな時にあなたと出会って
,いつもあなたに助けられて
,バイトが楽しみになって
,実はシフト被るように狙ってた
,スタンプ使いが妙に上手くて
,お化けも虫も受け付けなくて
,くしゃくしゃの笑顔が可愛くて
,眠れない夜は君のせいで
,この気持ち今すぐに伝えたい
,けどバレたくない
,どうしたらいいの
,迷ってるうちに
,夜明けが来て
,馬鹿みたいに後悔して
,ふたりの想い出

,寂しさ溢れて
,最後の恋だと信じて願った
,あの日々にウソはなかった
,帰り道の公園で受けた告白
,ベタすぎるセリフ笑っちゃった
,一生忘れられない思い出
,あなたがプレゼントしてくれた
,一日中ゲームやりこんで
,夜ご飯は一緒に作って
,贅沢なんてしなくたって
,２人いればそれだけでよくて
,口下手２人が本気で喧嘩
,お互いブロック通じない電話
,本気でぶつかり合えることが
,どんな愛しいが気づけなかって
,あなたが教えてくれたこと
,くれたもの
,胸に刻み過ごしてる今日も
,だから伝えたいありがとう
,ふたりの想い出
,かき集めたなら
,また泣けてきちゃう
,寂しさ溢れて
,最後の恋だと信じて願った
,あの日々にウソはなかった
,子供のままでいられたなら
,何も怖がらず歩いて行けたかな
,もっと早く大人になっていたなら
,２人で乗り越えられたかな
,今も君の夢夜空へ願う
,今でも君は
,あの頃と同じ笑顔で
,今でも君は
,あの頃のようにまっすぐで
,今でも君は
,あの頃と変わらない優しさで
,今でも君は
,君のままでいてほしいそう願うよ

,
,もしまたどこかで道が交わるなら
,笑ってこう言って
,「はじめまして。きっと
,君となら上手くやれる。」って
,
,君が笑ったり泣いたり怒ったり
,するそのときに
,いつも僕が一緒に居たこと
,何もかもがかけがえの
,ないものって気づいたら
,今度はもう忘れたりしないから
,
,一緒に歩いてきた道があったはず
,その途中に落としてきたものは
,きっと大事なものだったよね
,とても温かくて たくさんの
,
,今からもう一度
,この道を引き返して
,拾いに行くからさ
,大丈夫 君は一足先に
,行ってて　お願い
,
,僕が迷ったりすねたり疑ったり
,するときも
,君はずっと味方でいてくれたこと
,何もかもがこんなにかけがえの
,ないものなのに
,どうしてずっと気づけなかったかな
,
,たしか君に叱られたこと
,たしか君を傷つけたこと
,たしか君と笑い合っていたこと
,ぜんぶ　ぜんぶ
,
,僕が笑ったり泣いたり怒ったり
,するそのときに
,いつも君が一緒に居たこと
,何もかもがかけがえの
,ないものって気づいたよ
,思い出したよ　だから　だから
,
,どこかの交差点でまた偶然みたいに
,「はじめまして！」って
,僕は手を差し出すから
,君は何も言わずに子供っぽい笑顔で
,あの頃みたいにもう一度
,優しく握り返して、
,
,いつからか僕ら手を解いて
,喋る言葉もなくしたんだ
,隣を歩く君の横顔を見つめて
,ただ気付かないふりをしたんだ
,
,その頬に流れる涙の意味が
,まだわからない間抜けな僕は
,去って行く君の背中に
,ゴメンとだけ呟いた
,
,パズルのように
,繋ぎ合わせた未来
,僕が無くしたのはどこの
,ピースだろう
,
,寂しさで汚した心
,真っ白な空白に浮かべて
,虚しさだけが残るこの部屋で
,そっと巡るよ君の記憶を
,
,ゴムのように引き伸ばす毎日
,途切れそうな声で
,僕らは笑っていた
,
,
,
,変わってしまった心の形を
,無理矢理あてはめてみるけど
,痛いんだ 苦しいよ 君を傷つけて
,
,寂しさで汚した心

,笑いあって寄り添った日々の
,欠片抱いて眠るよ
,
,眠るよ
,
,少し歩き疲れたんだ
,少し歩き疲れたんだ
,月並みな表現だけど
,人生とかいう長い道を
,少し休みたいんだ
,少し休みたいんだけど
,時間は刻一刻残酷と
,私を 引っぱっていくんだ
,
,うまくいきそうなんだけど
,うまくいかないことばかりで
,迂闊にも泣いてしまいそうになる
,情けない本当にな
,惨めな気持ちなんか
,嫌というほど味わってきたし
,とっくに悔しさなんてものは
,捨ててきたはずなのに
,絶望抱くほど
,悪いわけじゃないけど
,欲しいものは
,いつも少し手には届かない
,そんな半端だとねなんか
,期待してしまうから
,それならもういっそのこと
,ドン底まで突き落としてよ
,答えなんて言われたって
,人によってすり替わってって
,だから絶対なんて絶対
,信じらんないよねぇ
,苦しみって誰にもあるって
,そんなのわかってるから何だって
,なら笑って済ませばいいの？
,もうわかんないよバカ！
,
,散々言われてきたくせに
,なんだまんざらでもないんだ
,簡単に考えたら楽なことも
,難関に考えてたんだ
,段々と色々めんどくなってもう
,淡々と終わらせちゃおうか
,「病んだ？」とかもう嫌になったから
,やんわりと終わればもういいじゃんか
,夢だとか希望とか
,生きてる意味とか
,別にそんなものはさして
,必要ないから
,具体的でわかりやすい
,機会をください
,泣き場所探すうちに
,もう泣き疲れちゃったよ
,きれいごとって嫌いだって
,期待しちゃっても形になんなくて
,「星が僕ら見守って」って
,夜しかいないじゃん　ねぇ
,君のその優しいとこ
,不覚にも求めちゃうから
,この心やらかいとこ
,もう触んないで　ヤダ！
,
,もうほっといて
,もう置いてって
,汚れきったこの道は
,もう変わんないよ嗚呼
,疲れちゃって弱気になって
,逃げ出したって無駄なんだって
,だから内面耳塞いで
,もう最低だって泣いて
,人生って何なのって
,わかんなくても生きてるだけで
,幸せって思えばいいの？
,もうわかんないよバカ！

,You would not believe your eyes
,If ten million fireflies
,Lit up the world as I fell asleep
,Cause they fill the open air
,And leave teardrops everywhere
,You’d think me rude but I wouuld just stand and stare
,I’d like to make myself believe
,That planet earth turns slowly
,It’s hard to say that I’d rather stay
,Awake when I’m asleep
,Cause everything is never as it seems
,Cause I’d get a thousand hugs
,From ten thousand lightning bugs
,As they tried to teach me how to dance
,A foxtrot above my head
,A sockhop beneath my bed
,A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
,I’d like to make myself believe
,That planet earth turns slowly
,It’s hard to say that I’d rather stay
,Awake when I’m asleep
,Cause everything is never as it seems
,When I fall asleep
,Leave my door open just a crack
,Please take me away from here
,Cause I feel like such an insomniac
,Please take me away from here
,Why do I tire of counting sheep
,Please take me away from here
,When I’m far too tired to fall asleep
,To ten million fireflies
,I’m weird cause I hate goodbyes
,I got misty eyes as they said farewell
,But I’ll know where several are
,If my dreams get real bizzare
,Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
,I’d lke To make myself believe

,Hoping you take that jump
,But don't fear the fall
,Hope when the water rises
,You built a wall
,Hoping the crowd screams out
,Screaming your name
,Hope if everybody runs
,You chose to stay
,Hope that you fall in love
,And it hurts so bad
,The only way you can know
,Is give it all you have
,And I hope that you don't suffer
,But take the pain
,Hope when the moment comes
,You say......
,I, I did it all
,I, I did it all
,I owned every second
,That this world could give
,I saw so many places
,And things that I did
,Of every broken bone
,I swear I lived
,Hope that you spend your days
,But they all add up
,And when that sun goes down
,Hope you raise your cup
,I wish that I could witness
,All you joy
,And all your pain
,But until my moment comes
,I'll say...

,It's gonna hit as hard as life
,But it ain't about how hard you hit
,It's about how hard you can get hit
,and keep moving forward,
,how much you can take,
,and keep moving foward.
,That's how we did to start it!
,Now if you know what you're worth
,then go on and get what you're worth.
,But you gotta be willing to take the hits
,and not pointing fingers saying
,you ain't what you wanna be
,because of him, or her, or anybody.
,Cowards do that and that ain't you!
,You're better than that!
,The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows

,清醒着空荡荡的宿舍
,假装错过了校车
,侥幸着 要去晨锻
,早就没了体育课
,希望着心里的每句话
,都有对她好好说
,却明白了 再开口就已经是
,最后的那一首歌
,时光轻轻发出回响
,夏天还是那么长
,总会有军训的学弟妹
,替我骂着地板烫
,没有我明年的一二九
,依旧还有人去唱
,别瞎想 梧桐年年落叶
,并没有什么不一样
,总是拥挤本部篮球场
,少了谁都没有那么一丝空旷
,那里没有自习的小哥和裙摆飘飞的姑娘
,夏天过去树叶金黄
,早已不是我还站在你的身旁
,你也依然记得清晨总是毛像正对着太阳
,别想了 就这样走吧
,总有人替我爱她
,别想了 就这样走吧
,就像没有遗憾呀
,四年光阴的尾巴
,啤酒单恋小龙虾
,可我还是没能忍住
,不该留下眼泪啊
,最后的你怎么一言不发还要忍耐呀
,还是无法流下眼泪哭出声响啊
,哪怕光草的风好心为你停下
,你怯懦的难过有谁能听清啊
,最后就让我们抱在一起放声哭泣吧
,和每个教室每只猫咪好好道别啊
,那句藏了四年也没能够说出的话
,我的复旦我爱你呀

,大学时代最后的一节课
,并不记得老师到底讲了什么
,也许寝室里打游戏
,压根没去也难说
,社团活动室里总是那群傻瓜
,准备毕业演出唱啊跳啊笑啊
,忙碌中的心安理得
,也值得羡慕啊
,别想了 就这样走吧
,夜雨吹落满地花
,别想了 就这样走吧
,明年还会再开呀
,红果果的学生证
,绿油油的学生卡
,突然发现 从今往后

,再见 再也不见
,陪我四年你的笑脸
,再见 仿佛能看见
,四年前初来乍到的少年
,是多欢喜 是多得意
,可以瞥见你的容颜
,最后的我一定不再犹豫不再忍耐啦
,最后的你别再等待和我好好道别啊
,光草的风听我说吧为我停下吧
,用一字一句画出我的思念啊
,最后就让我们抱在一起放声哭泣吧
,最后就让我们手拉着手大声歌唱吧
,这次请一定让我说出这句话

,如果你想忘记我也能失忆
,能不能给我一首歌的时间
,把故事听到最后才说再见
,你送我的眼泪 让它留在雨天
,越过你划的线 我定了勇气的终点
,你说我不该 不该
,不该在这时候说了爱你
,要怎么证明我没力气
,告诉我暂停算不算放弃
,我说你不该 不该
,不该在这时才说爱你
,要怎么证明我没力气
,我只有一天的回忆

,你在南方的艳阳里大雪纷飞
,我在北方的寒夜里四季如春
,如果天黑之前来得及
,我要忘了你的眼睛
,穷极一生做不完一场梦
,他不再和谁谈论相逢的孤岛
,因为心里早已荒芜人烟
,他的心里再装不下一个家
,做一个只对自己说谎的哑巴
,他说你任何为人称道的美丽
,不及他第一次遇见你
,时光苟延残喘无可奈何
,如果所有土地连在一起
,走上一生只为拥抱你
,喝醉了他的梦 晚安
,他听见有人唱着古老的歌
,唱着今天还在远方发生的
,像在她眼睛里看到的孤岛
,没有悲伤但也没有花朵
,你在南方的艳阳里大雪纷飞

,满怀忧伤却流不出泪
,极度的疲惫却不能入睡
,只能够日日夜夜 然后又日日夜夜
,无尽的日日夜夜 永远的深陷在人间
,我是蝙蝠却不能飞 困在日复一日的街
,无止尽的狩猎 彷佛一种天谴
,夜色就是我的披肩 日出就是我的风险
,舞池里的狂颠是我宿命制约
,上帝遗弃我们却又要给黯淡的月照亮世界
,要我们无尽又无情的繁衍
,看爱过的人一一告别
,做过的梦一一凋谢
,只留下我独自残喘的千年
,无法挥舞天使的纯洁
,也无法拥有魔鬼的果决
,只能像每个人类贪嗔痴傻和愚昧
,找寻着体温和血 找寻着同类
,满怀忧伤却流不出泪
,极度的疲惫却不能入睡
,只能够日日夜夜 然后又日日夜夜
,无尽的日日夜夜 永远的深陷在人间
,饥饿是最好的调味 孤独是最强的催眠
,疯狂找一双唇 能够当我酒杯
,早就对这一切厌倦 也曾愤怒喝下圣水
,却又无助醒在下个漫长黑夜
,青春遗忘我们却又要给回忆的美
,就像玫瑰要余生流血又流泪的受虐
,看镜中的脸慢慢枯萎 高举的拳渐渐粉碎
,只留下了无限唏嘘的相片
,无法挥舞天使的纯洁
,也无法拥有魔鬼的果决

,你身边又换了谁
,再别争是谁对
,这幸福我不配
,又做了好几次
,愤怒却化成了满地的卫生纸
,你深夜发文字
,不跟你和好真的不是我自私
,是谁的问题 但谁都没有问仔细
,但你的呼吸 会冲进我的灵魂里
,你总是在哭泣 嘴边总挂着对不起
,但你已不是你 我选择放弃
,嘴角的泪滴 你细声低语
,我想抱住你
,沉闷的雨滴 敲击我心里
,转身离开你
,嘴角的泪滴 你细声低语
,我想抱住你
,沉闷的雨滴 敲击我心里
,转身离开你
,有天我醒看到我的身边没有你
,在我的右边是你曾今喜欢的玩具
,可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你

,我那可爱的猫 今晚你不要在叫
,我那肥胖的猫 今天吃的已经不少
,我那胆小的猫 我叫你 你别再跑
,我那爱闹的猫 今晚你不要再闹x2
,你慵懒的身姿靠着沙发睡着觉
,你总是进入我的房间脚步静悄悄
,把你有力的尾巴冲着我不停的摇
,每当我回家的时候你们总是跑来对我叫
,有时候看着你们打闹不停上窜下跳
,有时候生气的我看着满床的猫毛
,经常在忙着录歌你们不停咬着我脚
,我说老铁你们快点往旁边稍一稍
,眯着你的眼睛 舔着你白色的猫毛
,阳光它照在你的身上总是在乱叫乱闹
,慵懒的样子看着真的特别可笑
,经常来帮你清理眼角你还在我床上尿尿
,你总是爱用你的脑袋对我不停撒娇
,它有时特别胆小 有时也会特别高傲
,满地的猫砂你也不怕扎到你的小脚
,只有猫粮不够的时候对我大吼大叫
,我那可爱的猫 今晚你不要在叫
,我那肥胖的猫 今天吃的已经不少
,我那胆小的猫 我叫你 你别再跑
,我那爱闹的猫 今晚你不要再闹x2
,你肥胖的肚子还有你的肉肉脸
,你发呆的样子看起来还真是有点贱
,太多的夜晚你们都能让我失眠
,在夜里偷拍你的时候电光镭射眼
,揪着你的脖子还往你的脸上吐烟
,你大了的时候还真是挺不要脸
,围着我的weed绕了三圈坐在我的脸
,每当我低落的时候总是趴在我的身边
,小时候可爱的样子现在已经不见
,活该我养了你们还要给你们去清理大便
,每天在阳台憧憬着外面的世界
,这一切对你们来说还真是特别新鲜
,有时候淘气的性格真是有些顽劣
,**************
,但你们还是在我身边一直都在陪伴
,我最好的不会说话的朋友 一直到在我身边

,春风 扬起你我的离别
,夏雨 打湿孤单的屋檐
,秋夜 飘落思念的红叶
,冬雪 转眼又是一年

,海… 我多想能看的更远
,爱… 两颗心间不断的长线
,我的喜悲都让你包围

,梦里 你在回家的路

,那一刻 多感动 那么普通的我
,原来也可以 被人珍爱着

,从未曾这样 真实地活着
,恨不得 把自己 全部都给他了
,只是最后的最后啊  他却丢了我

,在远方的她 此刻可知道
,这段情在我心 始终记挂
,在这半山 那天我知我知快将要别离没说话
,望向她 却听到她说不要相约
,纵使分隔 相爱不会害怕
,遥遥万里 心声有否偏差
,正是让这爱试出真与假
,遥远的她 仿佛借风声跟我话
,热情若没变 那管它沧桑变化
,
,但这天收到 她爸爸的一封信
,信里面说 血癌已带走她
,但觉得空虚 的心仿佛已僵化
,过去事象炮弹 心中爆炸
,在这半山 这天我悲痛悲痛不已在胡乱说话
,夜雨中 似听到她说不要相约
,纵使分隔 相爱不会害怕
,人无觅处 心声有否偏差
,正是让这爱试出真与假
,遥远的她 仿佛借风声跟我话
,热情若没变 那管它沧桑变化

,CHAPTER 1 THE PEDLAR
,The spring of 1634 arrives，
,but in the prison of Lancaster Castle it stays cold．
,The twenty women in the prison are dirty，
,hungry and cold．
,There are no beds or chairs and so they sleep on the cold floor．
,There are no windows，
,so it is always dark．
,The women want to get out of the prison；
,they want to go home．
,Sometimes the guards open the big，
,old door and put some bread and water on the floor．
,Then they close the door again．
,My name is Jennet Device，
,and I am one of the twenty women in prison．
,Day after day，
,I sit on the cold floor and wait．
,I want to feel warm again；
,I want to see the sky again，
,and Pendle Hill，
,the beautiful hill near my home．
,But I am in the dark prison of Lancaster Castle，
,and I sit on the cold floor and wait．
,One day， something happens．
,The guards open the big， old door．
,'Jennet Device！'a guard calls．
,'Come here at once，witch！Somebody wants to see you．'
,I get up slowly
,because I'm very cold
,and I walk across the dark room to the door．
,Perhaps it' s someone from Read Hall！
,Perhaps I'm going home！
,'Jennet Device，be quick！'the guard calls again．
,Someone is standing at the door with the guard．
,'Jennet，'he says quietly．
,I see him then：
,a tall man with brown hair and tired blue eyes．
,He is not from Read Hall．
,It is Mr Webster，from the church at Kild wick．
,My legs stop moving and suddenly I want to sit down．
,'Come on， come on，' the guard says angrily．
,He begins to close the door．
,'Come out here for a minute，
,Jennet，' Mr Webster says quietly．
,'Sit down and eat something．'
,I sit down at a little table near the door．
,Mr Webster gives me some bread
,and some meat and I begin to eat hungrily．
,'Ten minutes，'the guard says．
,'After ten minutes，she goes in again．
,'Thank you，'Mr Webster says．
,'How is everyone at Read Hall？'
,I ask at last．
,Mr Webster smiles．
,'Everyone is well．
,I was there yesterday．'
,I close my eyes for a minute．
,' Mr Webster， it' s not true．
,I'm not a witch， you know．'
,'I know，Jennet，'Mr Webster says．
,'Last week， I brought Edmund Robinson
,and his father into my church，
,and asked them about the boy's story．
,Many people believed Edmund' s story，
,but some people didn' t．
,Edmund Robinson is going to London tomorrow with his father，
,and a judge is going to question them．'
,The guard comes back and begins to open the door．
,' Time！' he says．
,Mr Webster stands up．
,'God is here with you，Jennet．
,Never forget that．
,You can be happy，when God is with you．'
,I stand up too， and take the bread from the table．
,' Yes， Mr Webster． God is with me；
,I believe that．' But happy？How can I be happy？
,I go back into the dark prison，
,and the guard closes the door behind me．
,The women run to me．
,'Bread！Give us bread！'they cry．
,Quickly， I put the bread in my shirt．
,I don't want to lose it．
,I walk across the room and sit down on the floor．
,I am crying，but I feel a little better．
,Edmund Robinson， of Newchurch，
,is only ten years old．
,Edmund told lies about me and about many women：
,he saw us at a witches' meeting at a house called Hoarstones．
,It's not true，but many people believed him．
,What is he going to say in London？
,The truth？ Or more lies．
,But now， in the prison of Lancaster Castle，
,I want to tell my story．
,It is a story about rich men and angry villagers；
,about old women and hungry children．
,It is a true story， and it happened to me．
,I was born in 1603．
,My family was always very poor，
,and after my father died， we were poorer．
,In winter， I was often ill and I was always cold and hungry．
,In summer，
,I was sometimes ill and I was often cold and hungry．
,We lived some miles from the village of New church，
,in an old house called Malkin Tower．
,It was dirty and cold．
,The rain came in through the windows and there were no doors．
,To the west， was the big hill called Pendle．
,Pendle Hill was beautiful．
,I loved Pendle Hill because it sat quietly all year and watched me．
,My story begins on the eighteenth day of March in the year 1612．
,I was nine years old，
,and my life began to change on that day．
,My mother and my grandmother were ill and they sat on the floor，
,with their dogs，near the little fire．
,My sister Alizon wanted to go out．
,'I'm going to look for bread，'she said．
,My brother James sat near the fire，
,his mouth open．'Go and look for bread，
,'he said．'Go and look for bread．
,'James often said things again and again．
,Alizon ran out of the house and I followed her．
,'Go and look for bread！'James called．
,Alizon began to go east，
,up the hill and past the big trees behind Malkin Tower．
,Alizon walked fast．
,She was eighteen years old and she was tall with long，
,dirty brown hair and a white，hungry face．
,It was cold， but there was no rain.
,Alizon wore a coat and some shoes，
,but I had no coat and no shoes．
,' Please wait a minute！' I called to.
,my sister．' I want to come with you．'
,'No！'Alizon cried．
,'Go back， I don't want you．'
,Suddenly， a dog ran in front of Alizon．
,' Good dog， good dog！' Alizon called．
,The dog ran to her and she put her hand on its head．
,It was my sister' s dog and it liked her．
,It was a big dog with big teeth
,and I didn' t like it because it was always hungry．
,I followed Alizon and her dog along the river to Colne．
,But before we arrived at Colne， we met John Law．
,John Law was a big fat man， about fifty years old．
,'Can I have some money， please？
,'Alizon called．'I'm hungry·
,John Law didn' t answer．
,He walked slowly because he was fat
,and because he carried a big bag on his back．
,In his bag were a lot of beautiful things．
,He was a pedlar and he walked across the hills and visited all the villages．
,'Can I have some money？'
,Alizon called again．'I'm very hungry！'
,John Law stopped．' Stop following me，'
,he said．' I'm not going to give you money．'
,'Give me money！'Alizon said．
,'I don' t want to give you money，'
,the pedlar said． He took his hat off．
,There was not much hair on his head．
,'I don't like you and I don' t like your family．
,A lot of bad women， you are，
,and your father was a bad man， too．'
,Alizon was angry．
,'Don't talk about my father-he' s dead now！
,Give me some money， old man！'
,John Law' s face was red．' No！' he cried．
,He began to walk up the hill to the village．
,'Go back to your dirty family！'
,Alizon began to laugh angrily．
,'A dead man！A dead man！'she called．
,'Dead before dark，John Law！'
,She looked down at her dog and put her hand on its head．
,'Go after him，dog，'she said．
,'Go after him and get him！'
,The big dog began to run after the pedlar．
,John Law stopped．
,He looked afraid and his face was very red．
,'Call your dog back，you bad girl！'he shouted．
,Suddenly，his mouth opened and his face went white．
,Slowly，he began to fall，
,and his big body hit the road．
,The dog came up to him，
,but the pedlar did not move．
,Alizon watched John Law for a minute．
,Then she said to me，
,'Go and call someone from the village．'
,I felt afraid，but I ran alog the road very quickly．
,'Help！Help！'I called to the villagers．
,'The pedlar is ill'
,The villagers came out of their houses
,and followed me down the hill．
,A young man looked at John Law carefully．
,'He's not dead，'he said，
,'but he' s very ill．
,Let' s move him to the nearest house．
,Someone must go and call his son．'
,Just then， John Law began to talk very slowly．
,'I can' t move！' he said．
,' I 'm alive， but I can' t move！'
,I went back to stand near Alizon．
,The dog sat at her feet．
,'That Device girl…'
,John Law said slowly，'she-she cursed me！
,She wanted me to die！
,And her dog came to get me．
,All the villagers looked at Alizon．
,'I 'm sorry，'Alizon said quickly．
,'I'm very hungry and I wanted some money，that's all．'
,'Go away！' the villagers cried．
,'You' re a witch，
,and we don' t want you in our village．'
,Alizon began to run away down the hill and her dog followed．
,I watched the villagers．
,They carried John Law slowly up the hill to the nearest house．
,And then I followed my sister down the hill．
,I was hungry and tired
,and Malkin Tower was many miles away．
,I was nine years old and I was angry．
,I was angry because the pedlar was ill．
,I was angry because the villagers didn' t like me ．
,And I was angry because my sister was a witch．

,CHAPTER 2 ROGER NOWELL
,John Law was ill because Alizon cursed him，
,and his son wanted Roger Nowell to question Alizon．
,Roger Nowell was a rich
,and important man in Lancashire，
,and he was the judge for all the villages near Pendle Hill．
,He lived at Read Hall， seven miles from Newchurch．
,On the thirtieth day of March，
,Mr Nowell's men came to Malkin Tower．
,Mr Nowell wanted to see Alizon at once．
,We walked from Malkin Tower to Read Hall：
,my sister Alizon，my brother James，
,and our mother，Elizabeth Device．
,I followed them because I didn' t want to
,stay at home with my grandmother．
,My grandmother was a difficult old woman，
,and I didn' t like her．
,Read Hall was an old house
,with a big garden and many old trees．
,Mr Nowell's servant opened the door for us．
,'Come in，'Mr Nowell said．
,He was a tall man with a lot of white hair．
,His black coat looked warm and expensive．
,Alizon followed Mr Nowell into a room with a big fire．
,When I saw the fire，
,I wanted to go in，too！
,'Are you cold，little one？
,'Mr Nowell asked me．
,'Come in，and sit near the fire．'
,I went across the room and sat down on the floor，
,next to the wonderful， hot fire．
,Mr Nowell sat behind a big fable．
,Two or three men， in black coats，
,stood near the window．
,Alizon stood in front of Mr Nowell．
,Her long hair was dirty，
,and her old dress looked dirtier．
,'Two weeks ago，
,on the eighteenth day of March，
,you met John Law near Colne，
,'Roger Nowell said．
,His voice was slow and careful．
,'Tell me about it．'
,'I asked for money，'Alizon said．
,'The pedlar was very angry and I didn' t like him．
,I was angry， too， and I wanted him to die！'
,' Tell me about your dog．'
,"The dog is my friend．
,'Alizon said slowly．
,'I wanted a friend，
,and I found that dog two months ago．
,I told my grand－mother，
,and she liked the dog， too．'
,'Did the dog run after the pedlar？'
,'Yes， of course． I cursed the pedlar，
,and the dog ran after him！'Alizon said．
,' I'm sorry now， because Mr Law is ill．'
,'She's a witch！'one of the men said quietly．
,Roger Nowell stood up
,and walked across the room to the door．
,'James Device， come in．
,We want to question you．'
,James came in and stood next to Alizon．
,James was thirteen years old，
,nearly a man，
,but he was afraid of many things．
,He began to cry．
,'Don't be afraid，'Mr Nowell said．
,'we want you to talk abut your grandmother，
,Old Demdike．'
,But Alizon wanted to talk．
,'Don' t ask him！' she said quickly．
,'I can tell you about my grandmother because
,I'm with her every minute of the day．
,I go with her from village to village．
,I go with her across Pendle Hill．
,She asks people for money and food，
,and I help her．'Alizon stopped．
,She looked at James，
,and then she looked at Mr Nowell．
,'She cursed a child once，
,and the child died later that year．'
,'And you！'James said．
,'You cursed a child， too！
,Somebody told me！
,'James suddenly sat down on the floor and began to laugh loudly．
,'Be quiet！'Roger Nowell said coldly．
,'Alizon Device，tell me the truth：
,did you curse a child？'
,'Yes， I did，'Alizon cried．
,'The child called me a witch，
,and I was angry．
,I cursed the child，
,but I was sorry when the child died．'
,James looked up at Alizon，
,his mouth open．
,'The child died，the child died，
,'he said again and again．
,'Alizon Device，you cannot go home again，
,'Roger Nowell said slowly．
,'You must go to the prison at Read．'
,'But I need Alizon！'
,my mother shouted angrily from the door．
,'She takes care of Old Demdike，my mother．'
,I looked at my mother，
,at her red， angry face．
,I looked at Alizon in her dirty dress，
,and at James on the floor with his mouth open．
,And then I looked at Mr Nowell：
,his brown eyes were warm，
,and his face was kind．
,On the second day of April，
,Roger Nowell and his men came to Ashlar House，
,near the village of Fence．
,Mr Nowell wanted to talk to my grandmother，
,and we all went with her to Ashlar House．
,Fence was not far from Malkin Tower，
,and my grandmother walked there easily．
,Old Demdike was a little old woman with a fat face and no teeth．
,She was nearly eighty years old and she was a difficult old woman．
,Without Alizon，
,she was more difficult because
,my mother didn' t take care of her．
,When I saw Mr Nowell again at Ashlar House，
,I felt happy．
,I looked at his kind face and his warm brown eyes，
,and I wanted to be near him．
,But there were a lot of people in the room，
,and I was afraid to go to him．
,'Old Demdike ， I'm going to ask you some questions，
,'Mr Nowell began．
,Old Demdike was not afraid．
,She looked at all the men，
,in their expensive coats and hats．
,'What can a poor old woman tell you rich men？
,'She laughed，
,and when she laughed I felt afraid．
,My grandmother was going to tell them everything！
,And she did！
,'Twenty years ago，I met the Devil，
,'Old Demdike said．
,'He was a boy called Tibb and he was my friend．
,Then a cat came to visit me-a beautiful cat-and then a dog．
,They were all my friends．'
,Mr Nowell listened quietly to my grandmother，
,but some of the men began to talk angrily．
,'Be careful，you rich men！
,'my grandmother cried．'I can curse you！
,I can kill people！ I make clay pictures of people-man，
,woman or child．And when I break the clay，
,that man，woman or child dies！'
,People began to shout．
,' She' s a witch！ She must die！'
,'Say no more； she must die，
,with all her family！'
,Roger Nowell stood up．
,'Be quiet！'He looked at the guards near the door．
,'Take her away，'he said．
,'Old Demdike and her granddaughter Alizon
,must go to the prison at Lancaster Castle．'
,The guards took my grandmother
,by the arms and carried her out of the door
,and put her on a horse．
,Everyone ran out of Ashlar House．
,They ran after the horses and shouted：
,'Kill the witch！'
,I looked for Mr Nowell，
,but he was on his horse， too，
,and he followed the guards quickly through the village．
,Slowly， I followed my mother and James．
,Malkin Tower was my home，
,but I didn' t want to go back there．
,I was a little child，
,and I wanted someone kind to take care of me．
,We stayed at home days，
,because we were afraid to go out．
,James sat in front of the fire，
,with his dog， and talked．
,'Lancaster Castle， Lancaster Castle，'
, he said， again and again．
,My mother hit me and shouted at me
,because she was angry with the rich men．
,But after three days，my mother suddenly said，
,'James！We' re hungry and we must eat！'
,James didn' t answer．
,My mother went across the room to James and pulled his hair．
,'Get up！'she shouted．
,'Go out and find food for us！
,Your father isn' t here now；
,you must find food for us．'
, She hit him over the head．
,James stood up slowly．
,'Go out and find food，'he said．
,'I must go out and find food．'
,It was dark， and James was out for hours．
,But in the morning，
,he came back with a sheep．
,'I went to Barley，'James said happily．
,'I got this sheep，and now we can eat．'
,'Get up， Jennet！'
,my mother shouted 'Come and help me！'
,It was Friday， the tenth day of April．
,My family had some friends， poor people，
,and on that day they came to Malkin Tower．
,They came and asked about Old Demdike and Alizon，
,and they stayed to eat and drink．
,I helped my mother．
,We cooked the sheep over a big fire，
,and our visitors ate with us．
,At the same time， they drank．
,They sat by the fire and drank，
,and talked about Lancaster Castle．
,'Let 's go there！'an old woman cried．
,'Let 's go to Lancaster Castle
,and find Old Demdike and Alizon！'
,'We can curse the guards，
,and break down the door！'
,my mother said．
,'Let' s bring them home！'
, said an old man．
,'Jennet，bring the bottle！
,We need more drink！'shouted my mother．
,I got up and took more drink to my mother．
,But I fell over one of the dogs，
,and the bottle broke on the floor．
,The drink was gone！
,' You bad child！
,' my mother shouted．
,'You' re a witch， too，you know！
,'She got up and began to hit me．
,She hit me over the head and pulled my hair．
,An old man laughed，
,and then everyone laughed．
,I ran back across the room．
,I wasn 't a witch；
,I was a child，nine years old，
,and I hated my mother and all her friends！
,My face felt very hot because I was angry．
,I left the room and went out of the house．
,It was afternoon， but the sky was dark with rain．
,Pendle Hill was dark，too．
,It sat quietly and watched me．
,'I'm going to Mr Nowell，'
,I said quietly， to Pendle Hill．
,'I'm going to tell him about my mother and her friends．'

,CHAPTER 3 A FAMILY OF WITCHES
,I ran from Malkin Tower,
,down the hill into Newchurch．
,James followed me．
,'I want to go to Read Hall,too,'he said．
,We ran through the trees to Sabden Brook．
,The noise of the river was beautiful in my ears．
,We went along the river to the village of Sabden,
,and then it began to rain．
,Suddenly,we heard the noise of horses behind us．
,We got off the road, and watched the horses．
,It was Roger Nowell with some of his men．
,They saw us, and Mr Nowell stopped．
,'It' s the Device children,' he said．
,' What's your name,child？'
,'My name is Jennet,' I said．
,'We 're going to Read Hall．
,I want to talk to you．'
,Roger Nowell looked at me with his warm brown eyes．
,'Very well,'he said．
,'Come home with me,
,and we can talk．
,'He lifted me up on to his horse,
,and the horse moved quickly
,along the road to the village of Read．
,James ran along behind us．
,Very soon,we arrived at Read Hall．
,The servant opened the door for us,
,and we went into the warm house．
,James came in,too,
,and sat down next to me near the fire．
,Mr Nowell put his black hat down on the table．
,'Bring a hot drink and some food for these children,
,'he told the servant．' They' re cold and hungry．'
,The servant brought bread and hot milk for us,
,and James and I ate hungrily．
,I felt warm and happy in Mr Nowell' s house．
,I wanted to stay there all my life；
,I never wanted to go back to Malkin Tower．
,When we finished eating,
,Mr Nowell looked up from his book．
,'You wanted to talk to me,'
,he said quietly．'Well, I'm listening．'
,I got up ,went across the room and stood in front of Mr Nowell．
,' I'm afraid of my mother,'
,I began．' I'm afraid because
,she' s a witch and she can kill people．'
,The room was quiet．
,Mr Nowell said nothing,
,but his brown eyes were kind．
,'My mother and her friends are at Malkin Tower,'
,I told him．'They want to go to Lancaster Castle and kill the guards．
,They' re going to bring Old Demdike and Alizon home again．'
,Mr Nowell got up and left the room．
,After some time, he came back with two of his friends．
,They all sat down at the table．
,'Jennet, I want you to tell me again about your mother and her friends．'
,'They want to kill the guards at Lancaster Castle
,and bring Old Demdike home to Malkin Tower,'
,I said．Then I began to cry．
,'Den't cry,'Mr Nowell said kindly．
,'We can help you,but we must talk to your brother first．
,James！'he called．
,'Tell me about your mother．
,Is she a witch？'
,' She' s a witch． We' re all witches,'
,James began．' Old Demdike's a witch．
,One night,she went to the church at Newchurch
,and got some teeth from dead bodies there．
,The Devil talked to her and she brought the teeth to Malkin Tower．
,They're under the ground by our door！'
,' Old Demdike' s a witch； we know that,'
, Mr Nowell said．'Tell us about your mother．'
,'Mother' s a witch,' James said．
,' She killed Mr Robinson,from Barley village．
,She made a clay picture,
,and then she broke it,
,and Mr Robinson died a week later．'
,James smiled at Mr Nowell．
,He liked Mr Nowell because
,Mr Nowell didn' t shout at him．
,'And I'm a witch, too！
,I can kill people！'
,'No, James！' I cried．
,' You' re not a witch！
,You don' t kill people！'
,' Yes, I do,'James said angrily．
,His face went red．' My dog,Dandy,
,is the Devil and he killed a man for me．
,I wanted a shirt and Mr Duckworth
,was going to give me one of his old shirts．
,But in the end, he didn' t give it to me and I was very angry．
,I nearly killed Mr Duckworth！
,But I called Dandy,and he killed Mr Duckworth for me！'
,I began to cry．My brother was a witch,too！
,All my family were witches！
,'Don't cry,Jennet,'Mr Nowell said．
,'Someone must take care of you．
,You can stay here at Read Hall with me．'
,When Mr Nowell' s men brought my mother to Read Hall,
,she said nothing at first．
,'Tell us about the pictures of clay,
,'Mr Nowell said．'My men found pictures of clay at Malkin Tower．'
,My mother said nothing．
,'Your mother,Old Demdike,
,is a witch．Your daughter is a witch,'
,Mr Nowell said．'Your son killed Mr Duckworth
,because of shirt．Now,tell us about the clay pictures．'
,My mother said nothing．
,'James told us about Mr Robinson of Barley,
,'Mr Nowell said ．' Did you kill him？'
,Suddenly, my mother' s face went red
,and she began to shout at James．
,'A good son,you are！
,You told this rich man about Jack Robinson of Barley．
,Well, you told the truth．
,I killed him！ I made a clay picture,
,and then I broke it, and a week later he died．
,I killed him because I hated him．'
,She stopped and looked at me ．
,I wanted to run away
,but Mr Nowell's servant stood in front of the door．
,Then my mother laughed． 'Jennet Device,
,witch' s daughter！ You hate us,
,I know that．
,Well, it doesn' t matter because you're right：
,you are different．
,You 're my daughter,
,but you're not the daughter of my husband．
,Your father was a rich man,
,but he never gave me money．
,A witch' s child,he called you．
,And when you were born,
,he never came near me again．
,Jack Robinson learnt the truth about your father．
,He told the villagers of Barley and they called me a bad woman,
,but they didn 't call your father a bad man！
,Nobody in Barley gave me food again,
,because of Jack Robinson．
,I hated him,and so I killed him！'
,The room was very quiet and my mother laughed again．
,My hands felt cold and my face was hot,
,but I didn' t cry．When Mr Device died,
,I cried for days．
,But he was not my father．
,I looked at my mother,
,at her dirty hair and her ugly face,
,at her angry eyes．
,I hated her then,
,and I hated her for many years．

,CHAPTER 4 TRUTH AND LIES
,On the twenty-seventh day of April,
,the guards took my mother and James to Lancaster Castle,
,and my life at Read Hall began．
,Suddenly,it was spring．
,The sky was blue and there were beautiful flowers on the hills．
,From Read Hall,Pendle Hill looked different ：
,it looked smaller, and it was not so important in my life．
,Sometimes I walked along Sabden Brook to Sabden,
,and then to Newchurch,
,and I felt happy to be near Pendle Hill again．
,But I never visited Malkin Tower again．
,Spring changed into summer,
,and in August I went to Lancaster with Mr Nowell．
,Lancaster was thirty miles from Read Hall,
,and I got very tired because I sat on a horse for hours．
,It was a big, noisy town．
,I never saw so many people before in my life and I felt afraid．
,The trial of the witches of Pendle
,began at Lancaster Castle on the eighteenth day of August,
,and the judge was an important man from London．
,Judge Bromley listened to many people on that day,
,because there were a lot of witches from Lancashire in the prison．
,Old Demdike was not there because she died in May,
,before the judge arrived．
,I waited with Mr Nowell' s servant,
,and when a guard called my name,
,I went through a big door and saw the judge behind a table．
,Judge Bromley was rich and important,
,but his eyes were cold．
,Suddenly, I saw my mother！
,She was dirty and very thin．
,When she saw me,her face went red．
,My hair was clean now,
,and I wore shoes and an expensive dress．
,I saw my mother' s eyes：
,she hated me！
,'Are you a witch？'Judge Bromley asked my mother．
,'No, I 'm not,'my mother answered angrily．
,'Did you kill Jack Robinson,of Barley village？'
,' No, I did not．'
,'Jennet Device is here,' a voice said quietly．
,It was Mr Nowell．
,'She can tell us the truth about her mother．'
,For a minute, my mother did not move．
,Then she ran across the room and shouted at me．
,'You know nothing, you bad child！
,And I'm your mother！Don' t forget that！'
,The guards ran after my mother and pulled her to the floor．
,' I'm no witch！'my mother shouted．
,' It' s all lies！ Jennet,you' re a witch
,a child of the Devil！
,You' re my daughter,and I know！'
,I was afraid and I put my hands over my eyes．
,I didn't want to see my mother' s ugly face．
,The guards pulled my mother out of the room and the noise stopped．
,'Jennet Device,'the judge said．
,'Tell us the truth about your mother．'
,Roger Nowell lifted me up
,and put me on a table in front of the judge．
,'My mother is a witch,'
,I began．'She has a friend,
,a dog called Ball．
,When she wants to kill somebody,
,she tells Ball…'I talked and talked；
,I told the judge everything．
,Judge Bromley listened carefully．
,'My child,is this the truth？'
,'Yes,'I answered．
,'I'm telling you the truth．'
,The guards brought my mother back into the room again．
,Her face looked tired and her eyes were red．
,'Elizabeth Device,your daughter told us about your dog,Ball．
,Your son, too,
,told us about the clay pictures．
,We know everything．'
,My mother said nothing．
,She didn't look at the judge and she didn' t look at me．
,Next, the guards brought my brother James into the room．
,When I saw James,I wanted to cry．
,James was thin and dirty and his hair was very long．
,He looked at the judge and at all the rich
,and important men in the room and he began to cry．
,Then he sat down on the floor．
,'Stand up,James Device,'
,Judge Bromley said．
,The guards pulled James up,
,but he fell to the floor again．
,'You killed Mr Duckworth,'
,Judge Bromley said．
,'I wanted a shirt,'James cried．
,'Is your brother a witch？'
,Judge Bromley asked me．
,' Yes,' I said． My brother sat on the floor,
,his mouth open．
,He looked at me,but he didn't know me．
,I was clean,and fat because of all the good food at Read Hall．
,'James told me about his friend,Dandy,'
,I began．'Dandy was the Devil and-'
,James heard the name Dandy,
,and he began to cry again．
,'I want Dandy！I want to go home！'
,The guards pulled him up from the floor
,and took him out of the room．
,I never saw my brother again．
,When the guards brought my sister Alizon
,in front of the judge, I said nothing．
,John Law,the pedlar,came into the room.
,He was a thin man now．
,He walked slowly and he talked slowly and his face looked ill.
,He told the judge about that day near Colne
,when Alizon cursed him and her dog ran after him．
,'I'm sorry！' Alizon said．
,' I was angry with you that day,
,but I'm sorry now．'
,Alizon 's eyes were dark and afraid,
,but she had no friends in that room
,and nobody wanted to listen to her．
,Then Mr Nowell took me out
,and I waited with his servant in a different room．
,An hour later,
,there was the noise of many people shouting and crying．
,The servant smiled．
,'The trial is finished,'
,he said 'You' re a good child Jennet．
,You told the judge the truth about the Witches．'
,Mr Nowell took me home to Read Hall．
,And on the twentieth day of August 1612,
,the guards took my mother,
,my sister and my brother out of prison ,
,and hanged them in front of Lancaster Castle．
,And so I lost my family．
,When I was a child,
,I wanted to be happy．
,I wanted to be warm,
,to wear shoes, to eat good food．
,I wanted someone to take care of me．That's all．
,My mother gave me nothing．
,She gave me no love．
,She never took care of me．
,Because my mother was a witch,
,my father ran away and I never knew him．
,My father was a rich man without a name,
,and I lived hungry and cold with a witch．
,And so I told Judge Bromley the truth about my family．
,Was I wrong？I don't know．
,I was happy for years at Read Hall．
,For twenty-one years, I forgot my family.
,I learned to cook for the Nowell family；
,I worked many hours every day but I was warm
,and I ate good food．
,Every Sunday,in my best dress,I went to church；
,every summer I walked over Pendle Hill．
,I never thought about my family,
,because I was happy at Read Hall．
,In August 1612,
,the guards hanged my family in front of Lancaster Castle．
,But their dead faces waited for me there；
,and a year ago, in 1633,
,when the guards put me in the prison in Lancaster Castle,
,I met them again．
,Day after day, I see their ugly,
,dead faces and hear their cold, angry voices．
,I think of them all the time．
,God is with me here,in prison．
,I believe that．
,But my dead family is with me too．
,Mr Webster,from the church at Kildwick,
,visits me again．
,His blue eyes are tired,but he smiles at me．
,'Edmund Robinson and his father told the truth in London, '
,he says quietly．
,' The child told lies about you because he was afraid of his father．
,He wanted his father to love him．'
,I say nothing． Mr Webster wants to be kind,
,but he cannot help me．
,Mr Nowell cannot help me because he is dead．
,Edmund Robinson is only a child；
,he tells lies one day,
,and the truth the next day．
,but the truth cannot help me．
,What can I do against hate ,and lies？
,When Mr Nowell was alive,
,the Villagers didn't talk about me．
,But when Mr Nowell died,the lies began．
,The villagers are all afraid of me
,because my name is Device．
,They hate me
,because my name is Device．
,They say I am a witch
,because my name is Device．
,I come from a family of witches,
,but I am not a witch．
,Nobody died because I cursed them．
,I never made clay pictures,
,I never had a cat or dog．
,I only wanted to live quietly at Read Hall
,and watch the changing skies over Pendle Hill．
,When I was a child,
,I was always cold and hungry,
,and I hated my family because they were witches．
,In 1612, I told the truth,
,and the truth killed my family．
,Now, twenty－two years later,
,lies are going to kill me,
,here in Lancaster Castle,
,and I am cold and hungry again．
,Mr Webster gives me bread,
,and I go back into the prison．
,I can never go back to Read Hall；
,I know that now．
,I must stay here in Lancaster Castle,
,with my dead family．
,They are watching me,
,and waiting for me．
,I can never be free of them．
,This is my true story；
,and I want to finish it now．

,CHAPTER 1 THE DANCERS
,'Quick！Quick！Close the door！It's him！'
,Annie Sorelli ran into the dressing－room，
,her face white．
,One of the girls ran and closed the door，
,and then they all turned to Annie Sorelli．
,'Who？Where？What's the matter？' they cried．
,'It's the ghost！'Annie said．'In the passage．
,I saw him．He came through the wall in front of me! And…
,and I saw his face！'
,Most of the girls were afraid，
,but one of them，
,a tall girl with black hair，laughed．
,'Pooh!'she said．'
,Everybody says they see the Opera ghost，
,but there isn't really a ghost．
,You saw a shadow on the wall．'
,But she did not open the door，
,or look into the passage.
,'Lots of people see him，'
,a second girl said．'
,Joseph Buquet saw him two days ago.
,Don't you remember？'
,Then all the girls began to talk at once．
,'Joseph says the ghost is tall
,and he wears a black evening coat．'
,'He has the head of a dead man，
,with a yellow face and no nose…'
,'…And no eyes-only black holes！'
,Then little Meg Giry spoke for the first time．
,'Don't talk about him．
,He doesn't like it．My mother told me．'
,'Your mother？' the girl with black hair said．
,'What does your mother know about the ghost？'
,'She says that Joseph Buquet is a fool．
,The ghost doesn't like people talking about him，
,and one day Joseph Buquet is going to be sorry，
,very sorry．'
,'But what does your mother know？
,Tell us，tell us！' all the girls cried．
,'Oh dear！'said Meg．
,'But please don't say a word to any one．
,You know my mother is the doorkeeper
,for some of the boxes in the Opera House．
,Well，Box 5 is the ghost's box！
,He watches the operas from that box，
,and sometimes he leaves flowers for my mother！
,'The ghost has a box！
,And leaves flowers in it！'
,'Oh， Meg，your mother's telling you stories！
,How can the ghost have a box？'
,'It's true， it's true，I tell you！'
,Meg said．'Nobody buys tickets for Box 5，
,but the ghost always comes to it on opera nights．'
,'So somebody does come there？'
,'Why，no！… The ghost comes，
,but there is nobody there．'
,The dancers looked at Meg．
,'But how does your mother know？'
,one of them asked．
,'There's no man in a black evening coat，
,with a yellow face．That's all wrong．
,My mother never sees the ghost in Box 5，
,but she hears him！ He talks to her，
,but there is nobody there！
,And he doesn't like people talking about him！'
,But that evening the dancers
,could not stop talking about the Opera ghost．
,They talked before the opera，
,all through the opera, and after the opera．
,But they talked very quietly，
,and they looked behind them before they spoke．
,When the opera finished，
,the girls went back to their dressing-room．
,Suddenly，they heard somebody in the passage，
,and Madame Giry， Meg's mother，
,ran into the room．
,She was a fat，motherly woman，
,with a red，happy face．
,But tonight her face was white．
,'Oh girls，'she cried'．
,'Joseph Buquet is dead！
,You know he walks a long way down，
,on the fourth floor under the stage．
,The other stage workers found his dead body
,there an hour ago -with a rope around his neck！'
,'It's the ghost!'cried Meg Giry．
,'The ghost killed him！'

,CHAPTER 2 THE DIRECTORS OF THE OPERA HOUSE
,The Opera House was famous，
,and the directors of the Opera House were very important men．
,It was the first week of work for the two new directors，
,Monsieur Ar mand Moncharmin and Monsieur Firmin Richard．
,In the directors' office the next day，
,the two men talked about Joseph Buquet．
,'It was an accident，' Monsieur Armand said angrily．
,'Or Buquet killed himself．'
,'An accident？…Killed himself？'
,Monsieur Firmin said．
,'Which story do you want，my friend？
,Or do you want the story of the ghost？'
,'Don't talk to me about ghosts！'
,Monsieur Armand said．
,'We have 1，500 people
,working for us in this Opera House，
,and everybody is talking about the ghost．
,They're all mad! I don't want to hear about the ghost, OK？'
,Monsieur Firmin looked at a letter on the table next to him．
,And what are we going to do about this letter，Armand？'
,'Do？' cried Monsieur Armand．
,'Why， do nothing， of course！
,What can we do？'
,The two men read the letter again．
,It wasn't very long．
,To the new directors
,Because you are new in the Opera House，
,I am writing to tell you some important things．
,Never sell tickets for Box 5；
,that is my box for every opera night．
,Madame Giry， the door keeper，
,knows all about it．
,Also，I need money for my work in the Opera House．
,I am not expensive，and I am happy to
,take only 20，000 francs a month．
,That is all．
,But please remember，
,I can be a good friend，
,but a bad enemy．
,O．G．
,'Don't sell tickets for Box 5!
,20，000 francs a month!'Monsieur Armand was very angry again．'
,That's the best box in the Opera House，
,and we need the money， Firmin！
,And who is this O．G，eh？Tell me that！'
,'Opera Ghost，of course，'Monsieur tirmin said．'
,But you're right， Armand.
,We can do nothing about this letter．
,It's a joke， a bad joke. Somebody thinks we are fools，
,because we are new here．
,There are no ghosts in the Opera House！'
,The two men then talked about the opera for that night．
,It was Faust，and usually La Carlotta sang Margarita．
,La Carlotta was Spanish，and the best singer in Paris．
,But today，La Carlot ta was ill．
,'Everybody in Paris is going to be at the opera tonight，'
,said Monsieur Armand，'and cur best singer is ill．
,Suddenly！ She writes a letter to us just this morning-she is ill，
,she cannot sing tonight！'
,'Don't get angry again， Armand，'
,Monsieur Firmin said quickly.'We have Christine Daaé，
,that young singer from Norway．
,She can sing Margarita tonight．
,She has a good voice．'
,'But she's so young， and nobody knows her！
,Nobody wants to listen to a new singer．'
,'Wait and see．
,Perhaps Daaé can sing better than La Carlot ta．
,Who knows？'

,CHAPTER 3 CHRISTINE Daaé
,Monsieur Firmin was right．
,All Paris talked about the new Margarita in Faust,
,the girl with the beautiful voice,the girl with the voice of an angel．
,People loved her.They laughed and cried and called for more．
,Daaé was wonderful,the best singer in the world！
,Behind the stage Meg Giry looked at Annie Sorelli．
,'Christine Daaé never sang like that before．'
,she said to Annie．'Why was she so good tonight？'
,'Perhaps she's got a new music teacher,'Annie said．
,The noise in the Opera House went on for a long time．
,In Box 14,Philippe,the Comte de Chagny,
,turned to his younger brother and smiled．
,'Well, Raoul, what did you think of Daaé tonight？'
,Raoul,the Vicomte de Chagny,
,was twenty－one years old．
,He had blue eyes and black hair,and a wonderful smile．
,The Chagny family was old and rich,
,and many girls in Paris were in love with the young Vicomte．
,But Raoul was not interested in them．
,He smiled back at his brother．
,'What can I say？ Christine is an angel, that's all．
,I'm going to her dressing-room to see her tonight．'
,Philippe laughed．
,He was twenty years older than Raoul,
,and was more like a father than a brother．
,'Ah, I understand,'he said．'You are in love！
,But this is your first night in Paris,
,your first visit to the opera．
,How do you know Christine Daaé？'
,'You remember four years ago,
,when I was on holiday by the sea,in Brittany？'
,Raoul said．'Well, I met Christine there．
,I was in love with her then,
,and I'm still in love with her today！'
,The Comte de Chagny looked at his brother．
,'Mmm, I see,'he said slowly．
,'Well, Raoul, remember she is only an opera singer．
,We know nothing about her family．'
,But Raoul did not listen．
,To him,good families were not important,
,and young men never listen to their older brothers．
,There were many people in Christine Daaé's dressing－room that night．
,But there was a doctor with Christine,
,and her beautiful face Looked white and ill．
,Raoul went quickly across the room and took her hand．
,'Christine！ What's the matter？ Are you ill？'
,He went down on the floor by her chair．
,'Don't you remember me Raoul de Chagny, in Brittany？'
,Christine looked at him,
,and her blue eyes were afraid．
,She took her hand away．
,'No, I don't know you．Please go away．
,I'm not well．'
,Raoul stood up, his face red．
,Before he could speak, the doctor said quickly,
,' Yes, yes, please go away．
,Everybody, please leave the room．
,Mademoiselle Daaé needs to be quiet．
,She is very tired．'
,He moved to the door,
,and soon everybody left the room.
,Christine Daaé was alone in her dressing－room．
,Outside in the passage the young Vicomte was angry and unhappy．
,How could Christine forget him？
,How could she say that to him？
,He waited for some minutes,
,then, very quietly and carefully,
,he went back to the door of her dressing－room．
,But he did not open the door,
,because just then he heard a man's voice in the room!
,'Christine, you must love me！' the voice said．
,Then Raoul heard Christine's voice．
,'How can you talk like that？
,When I sing only for you…？
,Tonight, I gave everything to you, everything．
,And now I'm so tired．'
,Her voice was un happy and afraid．
,'You sang like an angel,' the man's voice said．
,Raoul walked away．So that was the answer！
,Christine Daaé had a lover．
,But why was her voice so unhappy？
,He waited in the shadows near her room．
,He wanted to see her lover-his enemy！
,After about ten minutes Christine came out of her room, alone,
,and walked away down the passage．
,Raoul waited, but no man came out after her．
,There was nobody in the passage,
,so Raoul went quickly up to the door of the dressing－room,
,opened it and went in．
,He closed the door quietly behind him,
,then called out：
,'Where are you？
,I know you're in here！Come out！'
,There was no answer．
,Raoul looked everywhere-under the chairs, behind all the clothes,
,in all the dark corners of the room．
,There was nobody there．
,
,
,
,
,
,CHAPTER 4 THE PHANTOM IS ANGRY
,That was Tuesday night．
,On Wednesday morning Monsieur Armand
,and Monsieur Firmin were happy men．
,Paris liked the new Margarita-everything in life was good．
,The next opera night was Friday．
,It was Faust again,
,but this time with La Carlotta singing Margarita．
,By Wednesday afternoon they were not so happy．
,A second letter arrived for them-from O．G．
,Why don't you listen to me?
,I am getting angry．
,Leave Box 5 free for me．
,And where are my 20, 000 francs?
,On Friday Daaé must sing Margarita again．
,She is now the best singer in Paris．
,La Carlotta cannot sing-she has a very ugly voice, like a toad．
,Remember, I am a bad enemy． O． G．
,'So,Firmin,is this still a joke?'
,Monsieur Armand shouted．
,'What are we going to do now, eh?
,Is O.G.the director here,or are we?'
,'Don't shout,Armand,'said Monsieur Firmin tiredly．'
,I don't know the answers．
,Let's talk to Madame Giry,
,the door keeper of Box 5．
,Perhaps she can help us．'
,But Madame Giry was not helpful．
,Madame Giry was not afraid of ghosts,
,and she was not afraid of directors of Opera Houses.
,'People say that you're a friend of the Opera ghost,
,Madame Giry,' Monsieur Armand began．
,'Tell us about him．
,Some people say he has no head．'
,'And some people say he has no body,'
,said Monsieur Firmin．'What do you say, Madame Giry?'
,Madame Giry looked at the two men and laughed．
,'I say that the directors of the Opera House are fools！'
,'What！'Monsieur Armand shouted．
,He stood up,and his face was red and angry．
,'Listen to me,woman-'
,'Oh, sit down, Armand,and listen,'
,said Monsieur Firmin．
,'why do you say that,Madame Giry?'
,'Because,Monsieur, the Opera ghost is angry with you．
,When the ghost wants something, he must have it．
,He is clever and dangerous,this ghost．
,The old directors before you, they knew that,
,oh yes. At first they tried to stop him.
,Then there were many accidents in the Opera House,
,many strange accidents．
,And when did these accidents happen?
,When the ghost was angry！
,So, the old directors learnt very quickly．
,The ghost wants Box 5?
,He can have it every night．
,The ghost wants money?
,Let's give the money to him at once．
,Oh yes,the old directors understood very well．'
,'But we are the directors, not the Opera ghost！'
,Monsieur Armand shouted．
,He turned to Monsieur Firmin．
,'This woman is mad．
,Why do we listen to her?
,On Friday night La Carlotta is going to sing Margarita．
,And you and I, Firmin,
,are going to watch the opera from Box 5．'
,'Well, we can try that, Armand．
,But we don't want any accidents．'
,Madame Giry came nearer to the two men．
,'Listen to me,'she said quietly．
,'Remember Joseph Buquet?
,I tell you, the Opera ghost is a good friend, but a bad enemy．'
,The two men stared at her．
,'Those words,Monsieur Firmin said slowly,
,'why did you say those words, Madame Giry?'
,'Because the ghost says them to me．
,I never see him, but I often hear him．
,He has a very nice voice and he doesn't shout at people．'

,CHAPTER 5 A LETTER FOR RAOUL
,That Wednesday a letter also arrived for the young Vicomte de Chagny．
,He opened the letter, saw the name at the bottom,
,and smiled for the first time that day．
,Dear Raoul
,Of course I remember you!
,How could I forget you?
,Meet me on Thursday at three o'clock in the Tuileries Gardens．
,Don't be angry with me,Raoul,please．
,Christine Daaé
,Raoul put the letter carefully into his pocket. Angry?
,How could he be angry with an angel?
,On Thursday he was in the Tuileries Gardens by two o'clock．
,At ten past three he began to feel unhappy．
,At half past three he wanted to die,
,or to kill somebody．
,And then… she came．
,She ran through the gardens to him,
,and in a second she was in his arms．
,'Oh,Christine!'he said,again and again．
,'Oh, Christine!'They walked through the gardens together
,and talked for a long time．
,They remembered their happy weeks in Brittany,four years ago．
,'But why did you go away,Christine?'
,Raoul asked．'Why didn't you write to me?'
,For a minute or two Christine said nothing．
,Then she said slowly,
,'We were so young, you and I．
,I was just a poor singer from Norway,
,and you…you were the Vicomte de Chagny．
,I knew I could never be your wife．'
,'But I love you,Christine-'
,'No,shh．Listen to me,Raoul,please．
,I went home to Norway,and a year later,
,my father died．
,I was very unhappy
,but I came back to France,to Paris．
,I worked and worked at my singing,
,because I wanted to be an opera singer．
,Not just a good singer,
,but the best opera singer in Paris．'
,'And now you are,' Raoul said．
,He smiled．'All Paris is at your feet．'
,Christine turned her face away and said nothing．
,'Christine,' Raoul said quietly．
,'I want to ask you a question．
,Who was the man in your dressing－room on Tuesday night?
,Tell me,please!'
,Christine stopped and stared at him．
,Her face went white．'What man?' she whispered．
,'There was no man in my dressing－room on Tuesday night．'
,Raoul put his hand on her arm．
,'I heard him,' he said．
,'I listened outside the door and heard a man's voice．
,Who was he?'
,'Don't ask me,Raoul!
,There was a man's voice,yes,
,but there was no man in my room!
,It's true!Oh,Raoul,I'm so afraid．
,Sometimes I want to die．'
,'Who is he? Tell me, Christine,please．
,I'm your friend,I can help you．
,Tell me his name!'
,'I cannot tell you his name．
,It's a secret,' whispered Christine．
,'I never see him, I only hear his voice．
,But he is everywhere!
,He sees everything, hears everything．
,That's why I didn't speak to you on Tuesday night．
,He is my music teacher, Raoul．
,He's a wonderful singer．
,I sang so well on Tuesday night because of him．
,I am famous because of him．
,He is my angel of music!
,And he says he loves me．
,How can I leave him?'

,CHAPTER 6 LA CARLOTTA SINGS MARGARITA
,On Friday morning La Carlotta had her breakfast in bed．
,She drank her coffee and opened her morning letters．
,One letter had no name on it. It was very short．
,You are ill．
,You cannot sing Margarita tonight．
,Stay at home and don't go to the Opera House.
,Accidents can happen．
,Do you want to lose your voice-forever?
,La Carlotta was very, very angry.
,She got out of bed at once and did not finish her breakfast．
,'This is from Christine Daaé' s friends,'
,she thought．'They want her to sing again tonight．
,That Daaé girl is going to be sorry for this!
,I,La Carlotta, I am the best opera singer in Paris．
,And nothing is going to stop me singing Margarita tonight!'
,At six o'clock that evening the dancers were in their dressing-room．
,They talked and laughed
,and put on their red and black dresses for Faust．
,But Meg Giry was very quiet．
,'What's the matter,Meg?'Annie Sorelli asked．
,'It's the Opera ghost,Meg said．
,'My mother says he's angry．
,She's afraid that something's going to happen tonight．'
,'Oh,pooh!'the girl with black hair said．
,'Who's afraid of an old ghost?'
,An hour later Monsieur Armand
,and Monsieur Firmin went into Box 5 and sat down．
,They were not afraid of ghosts.Of course not．
,There were no ghosts in the Opera House．
,Then Monsieur Armand saw some flowers
,on the floor by the door of the box．
,'Firmin,'he whispered,
,'did you put those flowers there?'
,Monsieur Firmin looked．
,'No,I didn't,'he whispered back'Did you?'
,'Of course not, you fool!Shh,the music's beginning．'
,La Carlotta did not sing for the first hour．
,There were no strange voices in Box 5,
,and the two directors began to feel happier.
,Then La Carlotta came out onto the stage,
,and Monsieur Firmin looked at Monsieur Armand．
,'Did you hear a voice just then?' he asked quietly．
,'No!'Monsieur Armand said,
,but he looked behind him twice,
,then three times, and suddenly felt cold．
,La Carlotta sang and sang, and nothing happened.
,Then she began a beautiful love song．
,'My love begins to-Co－ack!'
,Everybody stared．
,What was the matter with Carlotta's voice
,What was that strange noise-Co－ack
,Carlotta stopped and began the song again．
,'My love begins to-Co－ack!
,I cannot forget my-Co-ack!'
,It was the noise of a toad!
,People began to talk and laugh.
,Monsieur Firmin put his head in his bands．
,Then he felt Monsieur Armand's hand on his arm．
,There was a voice in the box with them!
,A man's voice, laughing
,Poor Carlotta tried again, and again．
,'I cannot forget my-Co－ack!'
,Then the two directors heard the voice again,
,behind them,in front of them, everywhere．
,'Her singing tonight is going to bring down the chandelier!'
,The two directors looked up at the top of the Opera House．
,Their faces were white．
,The famous chandelier, with its thousand lights,
,broke away from its ropes and crashed down on to the people below．
,That was a terrible night for the Paris Opera House．
,One woman was killed by the chandelier,
,and many people were hurt．
,The Opera House closed for two weeks．
,And La Carlotta never sang again.

,
,
,
,CHAPTER 7 MY ANGEL OF MUSIC
,For a week Raoul saw Christine every day．
,Some days Christine was quiet and unhappy,
,some days she laughed and sang.
,She never wanted to talk about the Opera House,
,or her singing, or Raoul's love for her．
,Raoul was very afraid for her．
,Who, or what,was this strange teacher,
,this man's voice,her'angel of music'?
,Then one day there was no Christine．
,She was not at her home, not at the Opera House,
,not at their meeting places
,Raoul looked everywhere and asked everybody．
,Where was Christine Daaé?But nobody knew．
,Two days before the Opera House opened again,
,a letter ar rived for Raoul．
,It was from Christine．
,Meet me in an hour at the top of the Opera House,
,on the tenth floor．
,The tenth floor of the Opera House was a dangerous place.
,There were hundreds of ropes going down
,to the stage below it was a long, long way down.
,Raoul and Christine sat in a dark corner,
,and Raoul took Christine's hands.
,Her face was white and tired．
,'Listen,Raoul,'she said quiety.
,'I'm going to tell you everything．
,But this is our last meeting.
,I can never see you again.'
,'No,Christine!'Raoul cried．
,' I love you, and we-'
,'Shh! Quietly! Perhaps he can hear us．
,He's everywhere in the Opera House, Raoul!'
,'Who?What are you talking about, Christine?'
,'My angel of music．
,I couldn't meet you last Saturday
,because he came for me, and took me away．
,I was in my dressing room in the Opera House and suddenly,
,he was there in front of me!
,I saw the voice for the first time!
,He wore black evening clothes and a mask over his face.
,He took me through many secret doors and passages,
,down,down under the Opera House．
,There is a lake down there,a big lake；
,the waters are black and cold．
,He took me across the lake in a boat to his house．
,He lives there,Raoul, in a house on the lake,
,under the Opera House!'
,Raoul stared at her．
,Was his beautiful Christine mad?
,Christine saw his face,and said quickly：
,'It's true,Raoul,It's true! And he…,
,he is the Phantom of the Opera!
,But he's not a ghost,he's not an angel of music,
,he's a man!His name is Erik,and he loves me,
,he wants me to be his wife!
,No,Raoul,listen, there is more．
,He told me all this in his house, in a beautiful room．
,He said that no woman could ever love him,
,because of his face．
,He was so unhappy!
,Then he took off his mask,
,and I saw his face．'
,She began to cry,
,and Raoul put his arms around her．
,'Oh Raoul,he has the most terrible face!
,It is so ugly! I wanted to scream and run away.
,But where could I run to? He has the face of a dead man,
,Raoul,but he is not dead!He has no nose,
,just two black holes in his yellow face．
,And his eyes! Sometimes they are black holes,
,sometimes they have a terrible red light…'
,She put her face in her hands for a second．
,Then she said,
,'I stayed in his house for five days．
,He was very good to me,
,and I felt sorry for him, Raoul．
,He wants me to love him, and I told him…I told him…'
,'No,Christine,no!
,You're going to be my wife!
,Come away with me at once,today!
,You can't go back to him．'
,'But I must,' Christine said quietly．
,'He knows about you,Raoul．
,He knows about us．
,He says he's going to kill you．
,I must go back to him．'
,'Never!' said Raoul．
,'I love you,Christine,
,and I'm going to kill this Erik!'
,Erik…Erik…Erik…Erik…
,The word whispered round the Opera House．
,Raoul and Christine stared．
,'What was that?' Raoul said, afraid．
,'Was that… his voice?Where did it come from?'
,'I'm afraid,Raoul,'Christine whispered．
,I'm singing Margarita again on Saturday．
,What's going to happen?'
,'This,'Raoul said．
,'After the opera on Saturday night,
,you and I are going away together．
,Come on,let's go down now．
,I don't like it up here．'
,They went carefully along a dark passage to some stairs,
,then suddenly stopped．
,There was a man in front of them,
,a tall man in a long dark coat and a black hat．
,He turned and looked at them．
,'No,not these stairs,'he said．
,'Go to the stairs at the front．
,And go quickly!'
,Christine turned and ran．
,Raoul ran after her．
,'Who was that man?' he asked．
,'It's the Persian,' Christine answered．
,'But who is he? What's his name?
,Why did he tell us to go to the front stairs?'
,'Nobody knows his name．He's just the Persian.
,He's always in the Opera House．
,I think he knows about Erik,
,but he never talks about him．
,Perhaps he saw Erik on those stairs,
,and wanted to help us．'
,Hand in hand,they ran quickly down the stairs,
,through passages,then more stairs and more passages．
,At one of the little back doors to the Opera House,
,they stopped．
,'On Saturday night,then．
,After the opera,'Raoul said．
,'I'm going to take you away, and marry you．'
,Christine looked up into his face．
,'Yes,Raoul．'
,Then they kissed, there by the door of the Opera House．
,Their first kiss．

,CHAPTER 8 WHERE IS CHRISTINE Daaé?
,On Saturday morning
,Comte Philippe looked across the breakfast table at his brother．
,'Don't do it,Raoul,please．
,All this talk about ghosts and phantoms．
,I think the girl is mad．'
,'She's not mad,
,and I'm going to marry her,'Raoul said．
,'She's only a little opera singer,'
,Philippe said unhappily．
,'And she's very young．
,Are you still going to love her in ten,
,or twenty,years' time?'
,Raoul drank his coffee and did not answer．
,There were two more unhappy faces in the Opera House,too．
,The directors now understood about O．G．
,They didn't want any more accidents．
,'Box 5 is free tonight for O．G．
,Daaé is singing Margarita．
,And here is 20,000 francs．
,Madame Giry can leave the money in Box 5 for him．
,Is that everything?
,Monsieur Armand asked Monsieur Firmin.
,'It's a lot of money,'Monsieur Firmin said unhappily．
,He thought for a minute．
,'What about some flowers in Box 5?
,Madame Giry says that O．G．likes flowers．'
,'O．G．can bring his own flowers!'
,shouted Monsieur Armand．
,The evening began well．
,The chandelier was now back in place, with new ropes．
,All Paris was in the Opera House．
,Everybody wanted to hear Christine Daaé's voice again．
,People also knew about the love story between Christine Daaé
,and the Vicomte de Chagny．
,There are no love secrets in Paris!
,People watched the Comte and the Vicomte in Box 14 with interest．
,Young men from families like de Chagny do not marry opera Singers.
,When Christine came onto the stage,
,her face was white and she looked afraid.
,But she sang like an angel．
,Ah, what a voice!All Paris was in love with Christine Daaé．
,She began to sing the famous love song．
,Suddenly,every light in the Opera House went out．
,For a second nobody moved or spoke．
,Then a woman screamed,
,and all the lights came on again.
,But Christine Daaé was no longer on the stage!
,She was not behind the stage,
,she was not under the stage．
,Nobody could find her．
,The Opera House went mad．
,Everybody ran here and there,shouted and called．
,In the directors office, people ran in and out．
,The police came,and asked questions.
,But nobody could answer the questions．
,Monsieur Armand got angry and shouted,
,and Monsieur Firmin told him to be quiet．
,Then Madame Giry arrived in the office with her daughter Meg．
,'Go away,woman!'Monsieur Armand shouted．
,'Monsieur,there are three people missing now!'
,Madame Giry said．'Meg,tell the directors your story．'
,This was Meg's story．
,'When the lights went out,
,we were just behind the stage．
,We heard a scream-I thlnk it was Christine Daaé's voice．
,Then the lights came back on,
,but Christine wasn't there!
,we were very afraid,
,and we began to run back to our dressing room．
,There were people running everywhere!
,Then we saw the Vicomte de Chagny．
,His face was red and he was very angry.
,"Where's Christine? Where's Christine?"he shouted．
,Suddenly the Persian came up behind him and took his arm．
,He said something to the Vicomte
,and they went into Christine Daaé's dressing－room…'
,'Yes? And then?' Monsieur Firmin said quickly．
,'What happened next?'
,'Nobody knows!' Meg's face was white．
,'We looked into Christine Daaé's dressing－room,
,but…but there was nobody there!'

,CHAPTER 9 THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE
,When the lights came on, Raoul ran．
,He ran down stairs and along passages,
,through the Opera House to the back of the stage．
,In the passage outside Christine's dressing room,
,a hand took his arm．
,'What's the matter,my young friend?
,Where are you run ning to,so quickly?'
,Raoul turned and saw the long face of the Persian under his black hat．
,'Christine!'Raoul said quickly．
,'Erik's got her．Where is she?
,Help me! How do I get to his house on the lake?'
,'Come with me,'said the Persian．
,They went quickly into Christine's dressing－room.
,The Persian closed the door
,and went to the big mirror on one wall．
,'There's only one door into this room,'Raoul began．
,'Wait,'the Persian said．
,He put his hands on the big mirror, first here, then there．
,For a minute nothing happened．
,Then the mirror began to move and turn,
,and a big dark hole opened in it．Raoul stared．
,'Quick!Come with me,but be careful,'the Persian said．
,'I know Erik．I understand his secrets．
,Put your right hand up near your head,
,like this,and keep it there all the time．
, 'But why?'Raoul asked．
,'Remember Joseph Buquet,
,and the rope around his neck?
,Erik is a clever man with ropes in the dark．'
,They went down, down, down,under the Opera House．
,They went through secret doors in the floors,
,then along pas sages and down dark stairs.
,The Persian listened carefully all the time for strange noises．
,'When do we get to the lake?' Raoul whispered．
,'We're not going by the lake．
,Erik watches it all the time．
,No,we go round the lake and get into Erik's house from the back．
,I know some secret doors．'
,Soon they were there．
,In the dark,the Persian felt the wall carefully with his hands．
,'Ah,here it is,'he whispered．
,The wall moved under his hands and a small door opened．
,Very quietly,they went through,
,and then the door closed behind them．
,They could not get out．
,Inside the room it was very dark．
,They waited and listened．
,The Persian put his hands on the wall．
,'Oh no!'he whispered．
,'It was the wrong door!
,This is Erik's torture room-the room of mirrors!
,We are dead men,Vicomte de Chagny,dead men!'
,At first Raoul did not understand．
,But he soon learnt．
,The lights came on, and they heard a man's laugh．
,Erik knew they were there．
,The room was all mirrors-walls,floor,ceiling．
,There were pictures in the mirrors of trees and flowers and rivers.
,The pictures moved and danced in front of their eyes．
,And the room was hot．
,It got hotter and hotter and hotter．
,Raoul was thirsty,hot and thirsty,
,and the rivers in the pictures danced and laughed at him．
,He closed his eyes,but the rivers still danced．
,Water,he needed water,
,but the mirrors laughed at him．
,Soon he could not move or speak, or open his eyes．
,He was not thirsty now,just tired,so tired．
,'Oh Christine, I'm sorry,'he thought．
,'I wanted to help you,
,and now I'm dying…'
,Through a mirror in the wall Christine watched her lover in the torture room．
,Behind her Erik stood,with his hands on her arms．
,'He's dying,Christine,dying．
,Watch him carefully．
,No,don't close your eyes．Watch him!'
,Christine could not speak．
,She wanted to scream,but no words came．
,Then she found her voice again．
,How can you do this,Erik!
,Why don't you kill me?'
,'Because I love you,Christine．
,Marry me,be my wife,and love me．
,Then Raoul and the Persian can live．'
,Slowly,Christine turned．
,She looked into Erik's terrible,
,ugly face,and spoke again,very quietly．
,'Yes,Erik．From this minute I am your wife．'
,She put her arms around Erik's neck,
,and kissed him-kissed him slowly and lovingly on his ugly mouth．
,Then she took her arms away and said slowly,
,'Poor,unhappy Erik．'
,Erik stared at her．
,You kissed me! he whispered．
,' I didn't ask you,but you kissed me-freely!
,Oh Christine,my angel!
,That was my first kiss from a woman．
,Even my mother never kissed me!
,She gave me my first mask when I was two years old．
,She turned her face away from me every time I came near her.'
,Erik put his ugly face in his hands and cried．
,Then he went down on the floor at Christine's feet．
,'You are free,Christine,free!
,Go away and marry your Raoul,and be happy．
,But remember Erik,sometimes．
,Go now,quickly!Take Raoul and the Persian,and go!'

,CHAPTER 10 MADAME GIRY VISITS THE PERSIAN
,For weeks,all Paris talked about that night at the opera．
,Everybody asked questions,
,but nobody knew the answers．
,Where was Christine Daaé?
,Where was the Vicomte de Chagny?
,Were they alive,or dead?
,And the Phantom of the Opera…?
,Some weeks after that famous night Madame Giry
,went out one afternoon to a small house near the Rivoli Gardens．
,She went in and up the stairs to some rooms at the top of the house．
,The Persian opened the door．
,Madame Giry looked at him．'My friend,
,you know the an swers．Please tell me．
,Are they alive or dead?'
,'Come in,'the Persian said quietly．
,They sat down on some chairs by the window,
,and looked out across the Rivoli Gardens．
,'Yes,'the Persian said slowly,
,'The Phantom is dead now．
,He did not want to live any longer．
,I saw his body three days ago,
,and because of that,
,I can talk to you about him．
,He can not kill me now．'
,'So the Phantom was really a man?' Madame Giry asked．
,'Yes,his name was Erik．
,That was not his real name,of course．
,He was born in France,
,but I knew him in Persia．
,He was a famous builder and I worked with him there．
,For a time I was his friend,but not for long．
,When he came to Paris,
,I came after him-I wanted to watch him.
,He was a very clever,very dangerous man．
,He could be in two,or three,places at the same time．
,He could be in one place,
,and his voice could come from another place．
,He could do many clever things with ropes,
,and mirrors,and secret doors．
,You see,he helped to build the Opera House．
,He built secret passages underground,
,and his secret house on the lake．
,He could not live in the outside world,
,because of his terrible, ugly face．
,Unhappy Erik! We can feel sorry for him,
,Madame Giry．He was so clever…and so ugly．
,People screamed when they saw his face．
,And so he lived this strange life half-man,
,half-phantom．But he was a man,in the end．
,He wanted a woman's love…'
,He stopped,and Madame Giry asked quietly,
,'And Christine Daaé and Vicomte Raoul?
,What happened to them?'
,The Persian smiled．'Ah yes!
,What happened to young Raoul and the beautiful Christine…?Who knows?'
,Nobody in Paris ever saw Raoul and Christine again.
,Perhaps they took a train to the north,
,and lived a quiet,happy life to gether there．
,Perhaps Christine's wonderful voice is still singing,
,somewhere in the cold and beautiful mountains of Norway．
,Who knows?

,Chapter 1
,It was cold and dark out in the road
,and the rain did not stop for a minute．
,But in the little living－room of number 12 Castle Road it was nice and warm．
,Old Mr White and his son, Herbert,
,played chess and Mrs White sat and watched them．
,The old woman was happy because her husband
,and her son were good friends and they liked to be together．
,'Herbert's a good son,' she thought．
,'We waited a long time for him
,and I was nearly forty when he was born,
,but we are a happy family．'
,And old Mrs White smiled．
,It was true．Herbert was young and he laughed a lot,
,but his mother and his father laughed with him．
,They had not got much money,
,but they were a very happy little family．
,The two men did not talk because they played carefully．
,The room was quiet, but the noise of the rain was worse now
,and they could hear it on the windows．
,Suddenly Old Mr White looked up．
,'Listen to the rain!' he said．
,'Yes, it's a bad night,'
,Herbert answered．'It's not a good night to be out．
,But is your friend, Tom Morris,coming tonight?'
,'Yes, that's right．
,He's coming at about seven o'clock,
,the old man said．'But perhaps this rain…'
,Mr White did not finish because
,just then the young man heard a noise．
,'Listen!'Herbert said．
,'There's someone at the door now．'
,'I didn't hear a noise,'
,his father answered,
,but he got up from his chair and went to open the front door．
,Mrs White got up too and began to put things away．
,Mr White said,'Come in, come in, Tom．
,It's wonderful to see you again．
,What a bad night!
,Give me your coat and then come into the living－room．
,It's nice and warm in there．'
,The front door was open,
,and in the living-room Mrs White and Herbert felt the cold．
,Then Mr White came back into the living－room
,with a big,red-faced man．
,'This is Tom Morris,'
,Mr White told his wife and son．
,'We were friends when we were young．
,We worked together
,before Tom went to India．
,Tom, this is my wife and this is our son, Herbert．'
,'Pleased to meet you,' Tom Morris said．
,'Pleased to meet you, Mr Morris,'
,Mrs White answered．
,'Please come and sit down．'
,'Yes, come on, Tom,'
,Mr White said．'Over here．
,It's nice and warm．'
,'Thank you,'the big man answered and he sat down．
,'Let's have some whisky,'
,Old Mr White said．
,'You need something to warm you on a cold night．'
,He got out a bottle of whisky and the two old friends began to drink and talk．
,The little family listened with interest
,to this visitor from far away and he told them many strange stories．

,Chapter 2
,After some time Tom Morris stopped talking
,and Mr White said to his wife and son,
,'Tom was a soldier in India for twenty-one years．
,India is a wonderful country．'
,'Yes,'Herbert said．'I'd like to go there．'
,'Oh, Herbert!' his mother cried．
,She was afraid because she did not want to lose her son．
,'I wanted to go to India too,
,'her husband said, 'but…'
,'It's better for you here!'
,the soldier said quickly．
,'But you saw a lot of strange and wonderful things in India ．
,I want to see them too one day,' Mr White said．
,The soldier put down his whisky．
,'No!' he cried．'Stay here !'
,Old Mr White did not stop．
,'But your stories were interesting,'
,he said to Tom Morris．
,'What did you begin to say about a monkey's paw?'
,'Nothing!' Morris answered quickly．
,'Well…nothing important．'
,'A monkey's paw?' Mrs White said．
,'Come on, Mr Morris!
,Tell us about it,' Herbert said．
,Morris took his whisky in his hand,
,but suddenly he put it down again．
,Slowly he put his hand into the pocket of his coat
,and the White family watched him．
,'What is it? What is it?' Mrs White cried．
,Morris said nothing．
,He took his hand out of his pocket．
,The White family watched carefully-
,and in the soldier's hand they saw something little and dirty．
,Mrs White moved back, afraid,
,but her son,Herbert,took it and looked at it carefully．
,'Well,what is it?'Mr White asked his friend．
,'Look at it,' the soldier answered．
,'It's a little paw…a monkey's paw．'
,'A monkey's paw!
,'Herbert said-and he laughed．
,'Why do you carry a monkey's paw in your pocket,Mr Morris?'
, he asked the old soldier．
,'Well,you see,' Morris said,
,'this monkey's paw is magic!'
,Herbert laughed again,
,but the soldier said,'Don't laugh,boy．
,Remember, you're young．
,I'm old now and in India I saw many strange things．'
,He stopped talking for a minute and then he said,
,'This monkey's paw can do strange and wonderful things．
,An old Indian gave the paw to one of my friends．
,My friend was a soldier too．
,This paw is magic because it can give three wishes to three people．'
,'Wonderful!'Herbert said．
,'But these three wishes don't bring happiness,
,'the soldier said．'The old Indian wanted to teach us something-
,it's never good to want to change things．'
,'Well, did your friend have three wishes?'
,Herbert asked the old soldier．
,'Yes,'Morris answered quietly．
,'And his third and last wish was to die!'
,Mr and Mrs White listened to the story and they felt afraid,
,but Herbert asked,'And did he die?'
,'Yes, he did,' Morris said．' He had no family,
,so his things came to me when he died．
,The monkey's paw was with his things,
,but he told me about it before he died,'
,Tom Morris finished quietly．
,'What were his first two wishes, then?'
,Herbert asked． 'What did he ask for?'
,'I don't know． He didn't want to tell me,'
,the soldier answered．
,For a minute or two everybody was quiet,
,but then Herbert said,' And you,
,Mr Morris ：did you have three wishes?'
,'Yes, I did,' Morris answered．'I was young．
,I wanted many things-a fast car,
,money… 'Morris stopped for a minute
,and then he said with difficulty,
,'My wife and my young son died in an accident in the car．
,Without them I didn't want the money,
,so, in the end, I wished to lose it．
,But it was too late．
,My wife and my child were dead．'
,The room was very quiet．
,The White family looked at the unhappy face of the old soldier．
,Then Mr White said,'Why do you want the paw now?
,You don't need it．
,You can give it to someone．'
,'How can I give it to someone?'
,the soldier said．'The monkey's paw brings unhappiness with it．'
,'Well, give it to me,' Mr White said．
,'Perhaps this time it…'
,'No!' Tom Morris cried．
,'You're my friend． I can't give it to you．'
,then,after a minute,he said,
,'I can't give it to you,
,but,of course you can take it from me．
,But remember-this monkey's paw brings unhappiness!'
,Old Mr White did not listen and he did not think．Quickly,
,he put out his hand,
,and he took the paw．
,Tom Morris looked unhappy,
,but Mr White did not want to wait．
,'What do I do now?' he asked his friend．
,'Yes, come on, Father,
,Herbert said．'Make a wish!' And he laughed．
,The soldier said nothing and Mr White asked him again,
,'What do I do now?'
,At first the old soldier did not answer,
,but in the end he said quietly,'OK．
,But remember! Be careful!
,Think before you make your wish,'
,'Yes, yes,' Mr White said．
,'Take the paw in your right hand and then make your wish,
,but…'tom Morris began．
,'Yes, we know,'
,Herbert said．'Be careful!'
,Just then old Mrs White stood up
,and she began to get the dinner．
,Her husband looked at her．
,Then he smiled and said to her,
,'Come on．Help me !What can I wish for?
,We need money,of course．'
,Mrs White laughed,
,but she thought for a minute and then she said,
,'Well, I'm getting old now and sometimes it's difficult to do everything．
,Perhaps I need four hands and not two．
,Yes, ask the paw to give me two more hands．'
,'OK, then,' her husband said,
,and he took the monkey's paw in his right hand．
,Everybody watched him and for a minute he waited．
,Then he opened his mouth to make his wish．
,Suddenly Tom Morris stood up．
,'Don't do it!'he cried．
,The old soldier's face was white．
,Herbert and his mother laughed,
,but Mr White looked at Tom's face．
,Old Mr White was afraid
,and he put the monkey's paw into his pocket．
,After a minute or two they sat down at the table
,and began to have dinner．
,The soldier told the family many strange
,and wonderful stories about India．
,They forgot the monkey's paw,
,and because the soldier's stories were interesting,
,they asked him many questions about India．
,When Tom Morris stood up to leave,
,it was very late．
,'Thank you for a very nice evening,'
,Morris said to the family．'
,And thank you for a very good dinner,
,'he said to Mrs White．
,'It was a wonderful evening for us, Tom,'
,Old Mr White answered．'Your stories were very interesting．
,Our life isn't very exciting and we don't have the money to visit India,
,so please come again soon．
,You can tell us some more stories about India．'
,Then the old soldier put on his coat．
,He said goodbye to the White family,
,and went out into the rain．
,

,
,
,Chapter 3
,It was nearly midnight．
,In their warm living-room,
,the two old people and their son sat
,and talked about the soldier's stories．
,'India is a wonderful country,' Mr White said．
,'What exciting stories!
,It was a good evening．'
,Mrs White stood up to take some things into the kitchen,
,but she stopped and listened to Herbert and his father．
,'Yes,'Herbert said．
,' Morris told some interesting stories,
,but, of course, some of them weren't true． '
,'Oh Herbert!'Mrs White said．
,'Well, Mother, that story about the monkey's paw wasn't true．
,A dirty little monkey's paw isn't magic!
,But it was a good story．' And Herbert smiled．
,'Well,I think you're right, Herbert,' his mother said．
,'I don't know,' Mr White said quietly．
,'Perhaps the story was true．
,Strange things can happen sometimes．'
,Mrs White looked at her husband．
,'Did you give some money to Tom Morris for that paw?'
,she asked．'We don't have money to give away for nothing!'
,Mrs White was angry now．
,'Well,yes,'her husband answered．
,'I did, but not much,
,and at first he didn't want to take it．
,He wanted the monkey's paw．'
,'Well,he can't have it,'Herbert laughed．
,'It's our paw now and we're going to be rich and happy．
,Come on, Father．Make a wish!'
,Old Mr White took the paw from his pocket．
,'OK,Herbert, but what am I going to ask for?
,I have everything-you,
,your mother． What do I need?'
,'Money,of course,'Herbert answered quickly．
,'We need money!
,You're always thinking about money．
,That's because we haven't got very much of it．
,With money you can pay for this house ．
,It can be your house!
,Go on, Father, wish for thirty thousand pounds!'
,Herbert stopped talking and his old father thought for a minute．
,The room was quiet and they could hear the rain on the windows．
,Then Mr White took the monkey's paw in his right hand．
,He was afraid, but he looked at his wife and she smiled at him．
,'Go on,' she said．
,Slowly and carefully Mr White said,
,'I wish for thirty thousand pounds．'
,Suddenly he gave a cry and Mrs White and Herbert ran to him．
,'What's the matter, Father?' Herbert asked．
,'It moved!' Mr White cried．
,'The monkey's paw-it moved!'
,They looked at the paw．
,It was now on the floor and not in the old man's hand．
,The family watched it,
,and they waited-but it did not move again．
,So the little family sat down again and they waited．
,Nothing happened
,The noise of the rain on the windows was worse now
,and their little living－room did not feel nice and warm．
,Mrs White said,'It's cold Let's go to bed．'
,Mr White did not answer and in the end Herbert said,
,'Well,there's no money,Father．
,Your friend's story wasn't true．'
,But Mr White did not answer．
,He sat quietly and said nothing．
,After some time Mrs White said to her husband,
,'Are you OK ?'
,'Yes,yes,' the old man answered,
,'but for a minute or two I was afraid．'
,'Well, we needed that money,'
,Mrs White said,'but we aren't going to get it．
,I'm tired． I'm going to bed．'
,After Mrs White went to bed,
,the two men sat and smoked for some time．
,Then Herbert said,'Well,Father,
,I'm going to bed too．
,Perhaps the money is in a bag under your bed!
,Good night, Father．'And Herbert laughed and went out of the room．
,Old Mr White sat in the cold living－room for a long time．
,The candle died and it was dark
, Suddenly,the old man saw a face at the window．
,Quickly, he looked again,
,but there was nothing there．
,He felt afraid．
,Slowly he stood up and left the cold, dark room．

,Chapter 4
,The next morning the winter sun came through the window
,and the house felt nice and warm again．
,Mr White felt better and he smiled at his wife and son．
,The family sat down to have breakfast
,and they began to talk about the day．
,The monkey's paw was on a little table near the window,
,but nobody looked at it and nobody thought about it．
,'I'm going to the shops this morning,' Mrs White said．
,'I want to get something nice for dinner．
,Are you going to come with me?'
,she asked her husband．
,'No, I'm going to have a quiet morning．
,I'm going to read,' her husband answered．
,'Well, I'm not going to go out this evening,'
,Herbert said,'so we can go to bed early tonight．
,We were very late last night．'
,'And we aren't going to have stories about monkey's paws!'
,Mrs White said． She was angry．
,'Why did we listen to your friend?'
,she asked her husband．
,'A monkey's paw can't give you things!'
,she stopped but the two men did not answer her．
,'Thirty thousand pounds!' she said quietly．
,'We needed that money．'
,Just then Herbert looked at the clock and stood up.
,'I'm going to work,' he said．
,'Perhaps the postman has got the money for you in a letter．
,Remember, I want some of it too!'
,Herbert laughed and his mother laughed too．
,'Don't laugh, son,' Mr White said．
,'Tom Morris is an old friend and he thinks the story is true．
,Perhaps it is．'
,'Well,leave some of the money for me, '
,Herbert laughed again．
,His mother laughed too and she went to the door with him．
,'Goodbye, Mother,' Herbert said happily．
,'Get something nice for dinner this evening at the shops．
,I'm always hungry after a day at work．'
,'I know you are!' Mrs White answered．
,Herbert left the house and walked quickly down the road．
,His mother stood at the door for some time and watched him．
,The winter sun was warm,
,but suddenly she felt very cold．

,
,
,Chapter 5
,Slowly, Old Mrs White went back into the house．
,Her husband looked up and saw something strange in her face．
,'What's the matter?'he asked．
,'Nothing,'his wife answered,
,and she sat down to finish her breakfast．
,She began to think about Tom Morris again
,and suddenly she said to her husband,
,'Your friend drank a lot of whisky last night!
,A monkey's paw! What a story!'
,Mr White did not answer her
,because just then the post man arrived．
,He brought two letters for them-
,but there was no money in them．
,After breakfast the two old people forgot about the money and the monkey's paw．
,Later in the day, at about one o'clock,
,Mr and Mrs White sat down to eat
,and then they began to talk about money again．
,They did not have very much money,
,so they often needed to talk about it．
,'That thirty thousand pounds,'
,Mrs White said, 'we need it!'
,'But it didn't come this morning,'
,her husband answered．'Let's forget it!'
,Then he said,'But that thing moved．
,The monkey's paw moved in my hand!
,Tom's story was true!'
,'You drank a lot of whisky last night．
,Perhaps the paw didn't move,'Mrs White answered．
,'It moved!'Mr White cried angrily．
,At first his wife did not answer,but then she said,
,'Well, Herbert laughed about it…'
,Suddenly she stopped talking．
,She stood up and went over to the window．
,'What's the matter?' her husband asked ．
,'There's a man in front of our house,'
,Mrs White answered．
,'He's a stranger-very tall-and well－dressed．
,He's looking at our house…
,Oh,no…it's OK…He's going away…'
,'Come and sit down!
,Finish eating!'Mr White said．
,The old woman did not listen to her husband．
,'He isn't going away,'
,she went on．'He's coming back．
,I don't know him-he's a stranger．
,Yes, he's very well-dressed…'
,suddenly Mrs White stopped．
,She was very excited．
,'He's coming to the door…
,Perhaps he's bringing the money!'
,And she ran out of the room to open the front door．
,The tall, well－dressed stranger stood there．
,For a minute he said nothing,
,but then he began,'Good afternoon．
,I'm looking for Mr and Mrs White．'
,'Well,I'm Mrs White,' the old woman answered．
,'What can I do for you?'
,At first the stranger did not answer,
,but then he said,'Mrs White,
,I'm from Maw and Meggins．
,Can I come in and talk to you?'
,Maw and Meggins had a big factory
,and Herbert White worked there on the machinery．
,'Yes,of course,'Mrs White answered．
,' Please come in．'
,The well－dressed stranger came into the little living－room
,and Mr White stood up．
,'Are you Mr White?' the stranger began．
,Then he went on,'I'm from Maw and Meggins．'
,Mrs White looked at the stranger and she thought,
,'Perhaps he has the money…
,but why Maw and Meggins?
,And his face is very unhappy… Why?'
,suddenly the old woman was afraid．
,'Please sit down,' Mr White began,
,but now his wife could not wait．
,'What's the matter?'she cried．
,'Is Herbert…'she could not finish the question．
,The stranger did not look at their faces-
,and Mr White began to be afraid too．
,'Please, tell us!' he said．
,'I'm very sorry,' the man from Maw and Meggins began．
,He stopped for a minute and then he began again．
,'I'm very sorry,
,but this morning there was an accident at the factory…'
,'What's the matter?
,Is Herbert OK?' Mrs White cried again．
,'Well…' the man began slowly．
,'Is he in hospital?
,the old woman asked, very afraid now．
,'Yes, but…' the stranger looked at Mrs White's face and stopped．
,'Is he dead? Is Herbert dead?
,Mr White asked quietly．
,'Dead!' Mrs White cried．
,'Oh no… please…not dead!
,Not Herbert! Not our son!'
,Suddenly the old woman stopped
,because she saw the stranger's face．
,Then the two old people knew．
,Their son was dead!
,Old Mrs White began to cry quietly
,and Mr White put his arm round her．
,Sometime later the man from Maw and Meggins said,
,'It was the machinery-an accident Herbert called,
,"Help!"． The men heard him-
,and ran to him quickly,
,but they could do nothing．
,The next minute he was in the machinery．
,I'm very, very sorry,' he finished．
,For a minute or two the room was quiet．
,At last Mrs White said,
,'Our son! Dead! We're never going to see him again．
,What are we going to do without him?'
,Her husband said,'He was our son． We loved him．'
,Then Mrs White asked the stranger,
,'Can we see him?Can we see our son?
,Please take me to him．
,I want to see my son．'
,But the stranger answered quickly,
,'No!' he said．'It's better not to see him．
,They couldn't stop the machinery quickly．
,He was in there for a long time．
,And at first they couldn't get him out．
,He was… 'the man stopped．
,Then he said ,'Don't go to see him!'
,The stranger went over to the window
,because he did not want to see the faces of the two old people．
,He said nothing,
,but he stood there for some time and he waited．
,Then he went back to the old people and began to talk again．
,'There's one more thing,' he said．
,'Your son worked for Maw and Meggins for six years and he was a good worker．
,Now Maw and Meggins want to help you at this unhappy time．'
,Again the stranger stopped．
,After a minute he began again．
,'Maw and Meggins want to give you some money．
,' Then he put something into Mr White's hand．
,Old Mr White did not look at the money in his hand．
,Slowly he stood up and looked at the stranger, afraid．
,'How much?' Mr White asked, very quietly．
,He did not want to hear the answer．
,'Thirty thousand pounds,' the stranger said．

,Three days later,
,in the big,new cemetery two miles from their house,
,the two old people said goodbye to their dead son．
,Then they went back to their dark,old house．
,They did not want to live without Herbert,
,but they waited for something good to happen,
,something to help them．
,The days went by very slowly．
,Sometimes they did not talk
,because there was nothing to say without Herbert．
,And so the days felt very long．
,Then,one night,about a week later,
,Mrs White got out of bed because she could not sleep．
,She sat by the window and she watched and waited for her son．
,He did not come and she began to cry quietly．
,In the dark her husband heard her and he called,
,'Come back to bed． It's cold out there．'
,'It's colder for my son,'his wife answered．
,'He's out there in the cold cemetery．'
,Mrs White did not go back to bed,
,but Mr White was old and tired and the bed was warm．
,So, in the end, he went to sleep again．
,Suddenly he heard a cry from his wife．
,'The paw!' she cried．'The monkey's paw!'
,She came back to the bed and stood there．
,'What is it ? What's the matter?'Mr White cried．
,He sat up in bed．
,'What's the matter? 'he thought．
,'Why is she excited?
,What's she talking about?'
,He looked at his wife．
,Her face was very white in the dark．
,'I want it,'she said quietly,
,'and you've got it! Give it to me! Please!'
,'What?' Mr White asked．
,'The monkey's paw,
,Mrs White said．'Where is it?'
,'It's downstairs, Mr White answered．'Why?'
,Mrs White began to laugh and cry．
,'We can have two more wishes! '
,she cried． 'We had one-but there are two more!'
,'Oh,no!Not again!
,Think, woman!' Mr White cried．
,But Mrs White did not listen．
,'Quickly,' she said ．
,'Go and get the paw．
,We're going to wish for our boy to come back to us!'
,'No!' Mr White cried．'You're mad!'
,'Get it! Get it quickly!' Mrs White cried again．
,Mr White said again,
,'Think, woman! Think!
,Our boy was in the machinery for a long time．
,They didn't want to show him to us!
,Think!Do you want to see his body?'
,'Yes! He's my son．
,I'm not afraid of him!' she answered．
,'You don't understand,'
,Mr White said sadly,
,but he went downstairs to look for the monkey's paw．
,In the living-room it was dark and Mr White did not have a candle．
,Slowly, he went across the room
,and he put out his hand for the monkey's paw．
,He touched it, and quickly took his hand away again．
,'No!' he thought．'I can't!
,I don't want to see Herbert!
,His face-after he was in the machinery… no!'
,Then he thought about his wife-
,and he put out his hand and took the paw．
,In the bedroom his wife waited．
,She saw the paw in Mr White's hand and cried,
,'Quick! Make the wish!'
,'I can't,'Mr White answered．
,'Remember-he died in the machinery!'
,'Make the wish!
,I'm not afraid of my own son!'Mrs White cried again．
,Mr White looked sadly at his wife,
,but he took the paw in his right hand and said slowly,
,'I wish for my son, Herbert, to come back to us．'
,then he sat down in the nearest chair．
,But Mrs White went over to the window and looked out into the road．
,She stayed there for a long time and she did not move．
,Nothing happened．
,The monkey's paw could not do it!
,'Thank God!'Mr White said,and he went back to bed．
,Soon Mrs White went to bed too．
,

,
,Chapter 7
,But they did not sleep．
,They waited and they listened．
,In the end Mr White got up to get a candle
,because the dark made him more afraid．
,He began to go downstairs,
,but suddenly he heard a noise at the front door．
,He stopped,and he listened. He could not move．
,Then the noise came again．
,This time he ran．
,He ran upstairs,back into the bedroom
,and he closed the door behind him．
,But again the noise came．
,'What's that?' Mrs White cried, and she sat up in bed．
,'Nothing! GO to sleep again!'
,her husband answered．
,But Mrs White listened-and the noise came again．
,'It's Herbert! It's Herbert! she cried．
,'I'm going to open the door for him．'
,And she got out of bed and ran to the door of the bedroom．
,Mr White got there first and stopped her．
,'No!' he cried．'Think!'
,'But it's my boy! It's Herbert,' she answered．
,'No!Don't go!Don't…'her husband cried again．
,But Mrs White did not listen to him．
,She opened the bed room door and ran from the room．
,'I'm coming, Herbert． I'm coming!' she called．
,Mr White ran after her．'Stop!'he cried．
,'Remember, Herbert died in the machinery!
,You don't want to see him!'
,For a minute Mrs White stopped and looked at her husband,
,but then the noise came again and she began to run downstairs．
,'Help me! Help me!' she called to her husband．
,But Mr White did not move．
,'The paw!' he thought．'Where's the monkey's paw?'
,He ran back into the bedroom．
,'Quick!'he thought． 'Where is it?
,'At first he could not find it in the dark．
,Ah! There it was! He had it!
,Just at that minute he heard his wife downstairs．
,'Wait! Wait, Herbert! I'm coming!'
,she cried． She began to open the front door．
,At the same time Mr White took the monkey's paw in his right hand
,and he made his third wish．
,Mrs White gave a long unhappy cry
,and her husband ran down to her．
,She stood by the open door．
,Very afraid,Old Mr White looked out into the dark．
,The road was dark and quiet-and there was nobody there．

,Chapter 1 Two Ships
,The race began in the summer of 1910．
,On June lst,in London,
,a black ship,the Terra Nova,
,went down the river Thames to the sea．
,Thousands of people stood by the river to watch it．
,They were all excited and happy．
,On the Terra Nova,Captain Robert Falcon Scott smiled quietly．
,It was a very important day for him．
,He was a strong man,not very tall,
,in the blue clothes of a captain．
,He was forty-one years old,
,but he had a young face,like a boy．
,His eyes were dark and quiet．
,One man on the ship,Titus Oates,smiled at Scott．
,'What an exciting day,Captain!'he said．
,'Look at those people!
,I feel like an important man!'
,Scott laughed．'You are important,Titus,'
,he said．'And you're going to be famous,too．
,We all are．Do you see this flag?
,'He looked at the big British flag at the back of the ship,
,and smiled at Oates．
,'That flag is coming with us,'he said．
,'In the Antarctic,I'm going to carry it under my clothes．
,We're going to be the first men at the South Pole,
,and that flag is going to be first,too!'
,Five days later,on June 6th,
,a man opened the door of his wooden house in Norway．
,He was a tall man,with a long face．
,He waited outside the house for a minute．
,Everything was very quiet．
,He could see no houses,
,only mountains,trees,and water．
,It was nearly dark．
,The sky was black over the mountains．
,The man smiled,
,and walked quickly away from the house,down to the sea．
,In the water,a big wooden ship waited for him．
,The man got onto the ship,
,and talked and laughed quietly with his friends．
,The ship's name was Fram,
,and the man was Roald Amundsen．
,The Fram was the most beautiful ship on earth,
,Amundsen thought．
,His friends were the best skiers on earth,too．
,One of them,Olav Bjaaland,smiled at him．
,'North Pole,here we come,Captain,'he said．
,'Yes．'Amundsen said．
,His friends could not see his face in the dark．
,'Fram is going to the Arctic．'
,Everyone on the Fram was ready to
,go to the North Pole,to the Arctic．
,Amundsen wanted to go there,too．
,But first he wanted to go south．
,His friends didn't know that．
,At midnight on June 6th,
,the Fram moved quietly away from Amundsen's house,
,out to sea．
,
,
,
,
,
,Chapter 2 The Race
,The Fram went to an island in the south of Norway．
,It was a very little island,
,with only one small wooden house,
,two trees-and nearly a hundred dogs．
,'Look at that!'Bjaaland said．
,'It's an island of dogs!
,There are dogs in the water,
,near the trees,on the house-dogs everywhere!'
,Two men came out of the house．
,'Hassel!Lindstrom!'Amundsen said．
,'It's good to see you!
,How many dogs do you have for me?'
,'Ninety-nine,Roald,'said Hassel．
,'The best ninety-nine dogs from Greenland．
,And they're very happy!
,They don't work；
,they just eat and play all day!
,They're having a wonderful summer here!'
,'Good,good．'Amundsen laughed．
,'But that's finished now．
,Hey,Bjaaland!Stop laughing-come down here and help me．
,Let's get all these dogs onto the ship!'
,It was not easy．
,The dogs were fat and strong,
,and they didn't want to go on the ship．
,But at last,after three hours'hard work,
,all ninety-nine were on the ship,
,and the Fram went out to sea again．
,The men were not happy．
,The weather was bad,the dogs were dirty,
,and some of the men were ill．
,They began to ask questions．
,'Why are we bringing dogs with us?'
,asked one man,Jo- hansen．
,'We're going thousands of kilometres south,
,past Cape Horn,and then north to Alaska．
,Why not wait,and get dogs in Alaska?'
,'Don't ask me,'said his friend,
,Helmer Hanssen,'I don't understand it．'
,The men talked for a long time．
,Then,on September 9th,
,Amundsen called everyone to the back of the ship．
,He stood quietly and looked at them．
,Behind him was a big map．
,It was not a map of the Arctic．
,It was a map of Antarctica．
,Bjaaland looked at Helmer Hanssen,and laughed．
,Then Amundsen began to speak．
,'Boys,'he said．'I know you are unhappy．
,You often ask me difficult questions,
,and I don't answer．
,Well,I'm going to answer all those questions now,today．
,We began to work for this journey two years ago．
,Then,we wanted to be the first men at the North Pole．
,But last year,Peary,an American,
,found the North Pole．
,So America was first to the North Pole,not Norway．
,We're going there,but we're too late．'
,'I don't understand this,'Bjaaland thought．
,'Why is Amundsen talking about the North Pole,
,with a map of Antarctica behind him?'
,Amundsen stopped for a minute,
,and looked at all the men slowly．
,No one said anything．
,'We have to go a long way south before we get to Alaska,'
,he said．'Very near Antarctica,you know．
,And Captain Scott,the Englishman,
,is going to the South Pole this year．
,He wants to put his British flag there．
,An American flag at the North Pole,
,a British flag at the South Pole．'
,Bjaaland began to understand．
,He started to smile and couldn't stop．
,He was warm and excited．
,'Well,boys,'Amundsen said slowly．
,'Do we want the British to put their flag at the South Pole first?
,How fast can we travel?
,We have a lot of dogs,
,and some of the most wonderful skiers on earth-
,Bjaaland here is the best in Norway!
,So I have an idea,boys．
,Let's go to the South Pole,
,and put the Norwegian flag there before the British!
,What do you say?'
,For a minute or two it was very quiet．
,Amundsen waited,
,and the men watched him and thought．
,Then Bjaaland laughed．
,'Yes!'he said．'Why not?
,It's a ski race,isn't it,and the English can't ski!
,It's a wonderful idea,of course!Let's go!'
,

,Chapter 3 The Ponies
,On October 27th,
,the Terra Nova arrived in Wellington,New Zealand．
,When Scott came off the ship,
,a newspaper man walked up to him．
,'Captain Scott!Captain Scott!
,Can I talk to you,please!'he said．
,Scott stopped and smiled．
,'Yes,of course,'he said．
,'What do you want to know?'
,'Are you going to win?'the man asked．
,'Win?'Scott asked．'Win what?'
,'Win the race to the South Pole,
,of course,'the newspaper man said．
,'It's a race between you and Amundsen,now．
,Look at this!'He gave a newspaper to Scott
,Scott looked at it．
,It said：Fram races Scott to South pole.
,"We are going to win." Says Amundsen.
,Scott's face went white．
,'Give me that!'he said．
,He took the newspaper and read it carefully．
,The newspaper man watched him,and waited．
,'Well,Captain Scott,'he said at last．
,'Who's going to win this race?
,Tell me that!'
,Scott looked at him angrily．
,'This is stupid!'he said．
,'It's not a race!
,I came here to learn about the Antarctic-
,I'm not interested in Amundsen,or in races!
,'Then he walked back on-to his ship,
,with the newspaper in his hand．
,Later that day,he talked to his men．
,He gave them the newspaper,and laughed．
,'It doesn't matter,'he said．
,'We're in front of Amundsen,
,and we have more men,
,and more money．
,He has only eight men,and a lot of dogs．
,I know about dogs-
,they don't work in the Antarctic．
,We have sixteen men and the new motor sledges-
,they are much better．
,And tomorrow the ponies are coming．
,We need ponies,motor sledges,
,and good strong British men-that's all．
,Forget about Amundsen!
,He's not important!'
,Scott asked Oates to look after the ponies,
,but he did not let Oates buy them．
,When Oates first saw the ponies,
,in New Zealand,he was very unhappy．
,Most of the ponies were old,
,and some of them were ill．
,'They're beautiful ponies,Titus,'Scott said．
,'They come from China-they're wonderful ponies!'
,Oates looked at them angrily,and said nothing．
,Then he asked：'Where is their food,Captain?'
,'Here!'Scott opened a door．
,Oates looked inside．
,He thought for a minute．
,'We need more food than this,Captain Scott!
,These ponies are going to work in the coldest place on earth-
,they need a lot of food-more than this!'
,Scott smiled quietly．
,'We can't take more food on this ship,Titus.
,Where can we put it?
,But it doesn't matter,old boy．
,They're very strong ponies,you know．
,The best ponies on earth．'
,Later that night,Oates wrote a letter to his mother．
,There are nineteen ponies on the Terra Nova now,he wrote．
,All the penies are in a small room at the front of the ship．
,We eat our food in the room under the ponies,
,so our table is often wet and dirty．
,Scott makes a lot of mistakes,I think,
,and Antarctica is a very dangerous place．
,
,
,
,
,
,Chapter 4 Food Depots
,The two ships,Terra Nova and fram,
,arrived in Antarctica,in January 1911,
,at the end of summer．
,The Englishmen and the Norwegians wanted to stay on the ice all winter．
,They wanted to be ready to go to the South Pole
,at the beginning of the next Antarctic summer．
,The dogs pulled the Norwegians'sledges．
,They ran quickly over the snow
,and pulled the big sledges from the ship onto the ice．
,The men ran beside them on skis．
,They put a big wooden house on the ice．
,The house was full of food,
,and skis,and sledges．
,They called it Framheim．
,Outside the house,the dogs lived in holes under the snow．
,When the house was ready,
,the men made their first journey south．
,Before the winter,they wanted to take a lot of food south,
,and leave it in depots．
,For the long journey to the Pole,
,they needed a lot of food,
,and they couldn't carry it all with them．
,On February 10th,five men,
,three sledges,eighteen dogs,
,and half a tonne of food left Framheim and went south．
,It was easy．The weather was warm for the Antarctic,
,between-7°Centigrade and-17°Centigrade．
,The snow was good,
,and the dogs and skis went fast．
,They went fifty or sixty kilometres every day．
,After four days they reached 80°South,
,and made the first depot．
,Amundsen made his depot very carefully．
,It was very important to find it again,next summer．
,So he put a big black flag on top．
,Then he put ten flags to the east of the depot-
,each flag half a kilometre from the next-
,and ten flags to the west．
,So there were flags for five kilometres to the left of the depot,
,and five kilometres to the right．
,Then they went back to Framheim,
,and took some more food south,
,this time to 82°South．
,This time it was harder．
,The temperature was sometimes －40°Centigrade,
,and there were strong winds with a lot of snow．
,The dogs and men were very tired,
,and the tents and boots were bad．
,At the second depot,
,they put out sixty flags,
,to help them find it again．
,They came back to Framheim on March 23rd．
,It was nearly winter in the Antarctic．
,Their ship Fram was far away now,
,near South America．
,They were alone on the ice．
,Oates went with Scott to make the first British depot．
,They left Cape Evans on January 25th．
,There were thirteen men,
,eight ponies,and twenty-six dogs．
,The dogs were faster than the ponies-
,they ran quickly over the top of the snow,
,but the ponies'feet went through it．
,Every morning the ponies started first,
,and the dogs started two hours later,
,because they ran faster．
,At night,the dogs made warm holes under the snow,
,but the ponies stood on top of the snow．
,It was －20°Centigrade．
,After fifteen days Oates talked to Scott．
,There was a strong wind,
,and the two men's faces were white with snow．
,'Three of these ponies are ill,Captain,'
,Oates said．'They can't go on．'
,'Don't be stupid,Oates,'Scott answered．
,'They're good strong animals-the best ponies on earth．'
,'Not these three,'Oates said．
,'They're ill,and unhappy,
,and now they can't walk．
,Let's kill them,and leave the meat here,in the snow．
,We can eat it,or the dogs can．'
,'Of course not!'Scott said angrily．
,'These ponies are our friends,
,they work hard for us．
,I don't kill my friends!'
,Three days later,two of the ponies were dead．
,Scott's men were slower than Amundsen's；
,it took them twenty-four days to get to 80°South．
,They made a big depot there,
,and put one large black flag on top of it．
,Then they went back to Cape Evans．
,Their camp was on an island in the ice,
,and the sea ice moved sometimes．
,There were holes in the ice,
,and black sea water under it．
,One day seven ponies went through the ice into the sea,and died．
,One motor sledge also went into the sea．
,
,
,
,
,
,Chapter 5 A Long Cold Winter
,It was dark for four months．
,Outside the wooden house at Framheim,
,it was often －60°Centigrade．
,The dogs lived in warm holes under the snow．
,The men stayed in the house,
,and worked in their rooms under the snow．
,The skis and sledges came from the best shops in Norway,
,but Bjaaland wasn't happy with them．
,He changed a lot of things on the skis and sledges．
,Soon the sledges were stronger than before．
,The skis were better and faster,too．
,All the Norwegians worked hard．
,They looked after their dogs,
,and worked on their equipment-the sledges,skis,tents．
,Every day they thought about their journey to the Pole,
,and talked about it．
,And every day,Amundsen thought about Scott．
,One day,in midwinter,
,he talked to his men．
,'Let's start early,before Scott,'
,Amundsen said．'Remember,Scott has more men than us,
,and he has motor sledges,too.
,Perhaps they can go faster than us．'
,Bjaaland laughed．'Oh no,
,they can't go faster than me,'
,he said．'On snow,
,nothing can go faster than a good man on skis．'
,'We don't know,'Amundsen said．
,'You're the best skier in Norway,
,but you get tired,and dogs get tired,too．
,Motor sledges don't get tired．
,They can go all day and all night．'
,Johansen laughed angrily．
,'That's stupid,'he said．
,'Perhaps the motor sledges can go all night,
,but the Englishmen can't．
,The English can't win,Roald-
,they don't understand snow,but we do．
,And they're too slow．'
,'Perhaps,'Amundsen said．
,'But I want to win this race．
,So we're going to start early!
,Do you understand?'
,It was quiet and warm inside Framheim．
,Bjaaland looked at Amundsen,
,and thought about the long,
,cold journey in front of him．
,He thought about the dogs in their holes under the snow,
,and listened to the wind over the house．
,'When,Roald?'he said quietly．
,'On August 24th．
,The sun comes back on that day．
,We start then．'
,'But we can't!'Johansen said．
,He looked angry,and unhappy．
,'That's too early!
,We can't start then-it's dangerous and stupid!'
,Amundsen looked at Johansen coldly．
,'You're wrong,Johansen,'
,he said．'We want to win,remember?
,So we start on August 24th．'
,Bjaaland listened to the winter wind outside．
,In Scott's camp,at Cape Evans,
,no one talked about Amundsen and no one worked hard．
,They had good food,
,and they played football on the snow．
,They wrote a newspaper-
,The south Polar Times-and read books．
,No one learnt to ski,no one worked on the motor sledges．
,Twice,men went for long journeys across the snow．
,They walked,and pulled the sledges themselves．
,Oates stayed at Cape Evans and looked after his ponies．
,Over the window in Cape Evans,
,Scott put a map of Antarctica．
,With a pen,he made a line from Cape Evans to the South Pole,
,and he put a little Britisn Flag at the Pole．
,Under the map,Scott wrote the day for the start of their journey．
,We start on November 3rd,he wrote．
,
,Hello, I'm Neil. And I'm Helen. How are you Neil? Not good. What's wrong? I posted my house-keys. You posted your house-keys?
,Let me guess, you dropped them in the letterbox by mistake. Yes, I got mixed up. Instead of putting a letter in, I put my keys in.
,Oh dear. But I have my address attached to my keys, so maybe they'll end up getting posted back to me. Yes, you might get them posted back to your house or you might get burgled, now that someone has your address as well as your house-keys.
,Oh no, thieves might get into my house. I'd better go and wait outside to see what happens. OK, good luck. I'll keep you posted. See you later. Neil will "keep me posted".
,That doesn't mean he's going to put me in the postbox, even though he's obviously a bit confused about what should or shouldn't go in postboxes.
,It means he will keep me informed, he will tell me what happens. Listen to some examples. I don't know what time they're arriving, but I'll keep you posted.
,Keep me posted on how things go in your new job. I kept them posted on what was happening. I hope Neil's keys find their way home. Hello? Hi, it's Neil. Neil. Any news?
,Well, someone posted my keys back to me. Great. But they put them through the letterbox. Oh no, so you've got your keys back, but now you're locked out.
,And I'm stuck. I tried to get through a window but I don't fit. I'm half-in, half-out. Thank goodness, help must be arriving. Don't move. Does it look like I can move? Hands on your head.
,Oh dear, it sounds like someone called the police. They probably thought Neil was a burglar. But, this is my house. Is it indeed? I'd better leave you to explain yourself now.
,But do keep me posted Neil. Keep you posted. How am I going to do that if I'm locked up? Arrested for for breaking into my own house. Bye.
,
,Hi, I'm Helen, and welcome to The English We Speak. Sorry, I'll be with you in a minute, Chris. I'm just on the phone to Rob.
,Sure.
,Rob, do you need me to come and record with you in the studio this afternoon?
,No, don't worry. I've got Neil coming over to record with me.Everything's hunky-dory.
,Everything's what?
,Gotta go. Speak to you later, bye.
,OK, b-, oh, he hung up.
,Having a busy day, Helen?
,Yes, it's been so busy. I've got to move all these boxes. How's your day going?
,No problems really. I've finished my script and I've already recorded another programme with Rosie. I'm hunky-dory.
,Hunky-dory? That's what Rob just said to me. Neither of you is very hunky though.
,What?! Well, hunky means muscular doesn't it? Well yes, hunky is a slang word for describing someone who is muscular.
,So, you're not telling the truth when you say, I'm hunky… Dory. My name is not Dory though. Why do you call me that?
,I wasn't lying and saying "I'm hunky", and I wasn't calling you "Dory" either. The phrase hunky-dory doesn't have anything to do with being muscular. It's an informal way of saying something's fine or satisfactory.
,Ohhhh. It's a bit of a strange phrase though. Yes, it is. No one really knows where it comes from, other than it's believed to be an American phrase. I see. So how can you use it?
,Well, here are some examples.
,I was really worried I'd lost her, but everything's hunky-dory now. She was waiting for me by the car.
,Our washing machine broke last night. An engineer is coming to take a look at it today, so it should be hunky-dory soon.
,So you can use hunky-dory as an informal way to say that a situation is fine.
,Now I understand. Well, sadly nothing is hunky-dory for me. I've got all these boxes to move.
,Is that why you invited me here?
,Maybe?
,Hmm right then, let's get on with it. Right, where do you want them? Just over there, thanks.
,OK. Haha. My work will soon be done.
,
,Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Jennifer, and with me in the studio is, yawn, Helen.
,Hi Jen. Are you a bit tired? Oh yes, I really am. I've been here since seven this morning. I think I'm ready to call it a day now.
,What do you want to call it? Monday? Tuesday? Oh no, I don't mean. How about Saturday? That's my favourite day.
,Or we could call it a new day altogether. What about cake-day, or coffee-day. I don't want to rename the day.
,In English, if you're ready to call it a day, it means that you want to finish whatever you're doing, and usually go home.
,So you want to call it a day now? We haven't finished the programme yet. That's true.
,In that case, let's hear some examples of the phrase in action. We're getting nowhere with this.
,Shall we call it a day and start again tomorrow? I'm getting picked up from work at five, so I think I'd better call it a day.
,I see, so if you call it a day, you decide that it's time to finish the work you're doing. That's right, so let's call it a day right now.
,Alright then, do you fancy a quick drink after work? Well, I'm feeling pretty tired, but I suppose I could come out for one drink.
,Let's go then! Some time later... Jen, look at the time, we've been here seven hours. I know. I don't know where the evening went.
,It's probably time to call it a night. I thought the phrase was "call it a day"? We can also say "call it a night" if you've been somewhere in the evening and you know it's time to go home.
,Well, I definitely think that you need to call it a night, then. Although look. What? The sun is coming up already.
,We've been out on the town all night. Perhaps we should call it a day instead? That means it's nearly time for work again. Can I call in sick, please?
,
,Hello. I'm Rob. And this is Li.
,Hello.
,Now, the weather is so great today we're outside on the sea, sailing in this beautiful boat. So Li, what do you think?
,Wow, impressive. Rob, I didn't know you had a sailing boat. In fact I didn't know you could sail a boat.
,Oh, don't worry Li, I know what I'm doing.
,Oh mind that rock.
,Whoa,phew it's okay Li. I'm in control, just keep your hand on that rope.
,We've got the wind in our sails, the sea is calm. We can just easily sail around this island and be home in time for tea.
,Oh right. I thought our excursion was going to be trouble free, or plain sailing.
,What? Plain sailing? We're not sailing any planes Li.
, No Rob. Plain sailing. It's an expression used to describe an activity that goes well or smoothly and is easy and uncomplicated.
,Yes of course. This sailing is going well and is actually quite easy. So you're right. This is plain sailing.
,But can we only use the phrase to describe sailing boats?
, No. Although it was originally a sailing term, it can really refer to any activity. Listen to these examples.
,Driving through the city was difficult but once we were on the motorway it was plain sailing all the way.
,Once we found some office space and recruited staff, setting up our business was plain sailing.
, So plain sailing means things are going well.
, I have to admit Rob, your sailing skills are very good and, oh watch out for that big wave.
,Whoa, ouch. Oh oh, I've hit my head on the boom. Oh no, we're heading for the rocks again. Hold the rope Li, quick quick.
,I've changed my mind Rob, this isn't plain sailing anymore.
,That's taken the wind out of your sails Rob.
,Err, Li it's still windy. Look at the sails.
,No Rob. That's another sailing idiom, to take the wind out of your sails is an expression that means your boasting and arrogance has been challenged.
,Let's hear some other people using this expression.
,I was all ready for a big argument but when he bought me some flowers it took the wind out of my sails.
,The negative feedback from my boss has really taken the wind out of my sails.
,Hmm, so Li you've certainly taught me a lot about sailing today. There are some really good expressions, but one thing you haven't taught me is how to sail this boat.
, But you said you knew how to sail it.
,Well when I said I had been sailing several times I had, but I meant on a ferry, as a passenger.
,Oh, watch out.
,That was close. I've a feeling this really isn't going to be plain sailing after all.
,Too right. Bye bye.
, Bye. Now Li could you just hold that rope there.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.
,Presenting the programme with me today is Li.
,She hasn't arrived at the studio yet and I must say that I'm a bit nervous about her arrival.
,Something's happened to her recently. she's so unfriendly and even frightening. A real dragon.
,What are you saying? Why Neil, why are you not waiting for me?
,This guy, honestly, right, come on. I haven't got all day. Give me the script.
,Ah, hello, I'm Li. blah, blah, blah, this is rubbish as usual.
,Li, what's the matter with you?
,What do you mean? Can we get on with this please?
,Oh, what a dragon！
,What did you say?
,I said that you're a dragon, Li.
,No I'm not, I'm a rooster.
,No, I'm not talking about your Chinese zodiac sign, I mean your personality.
,Oh, oh, thanks.
,What?
,I said thank you.
,Li,I called you a dragen that's not a compliment
,Neil called me a dragon. To us Chinese this is a great compliment, but he says it's not. I wonder what he means.
,Listen to these examples and see if you can get the meaning.
,I'm never going to make my deadline with this report.
,You should speak to Kate to get an extension.
,But I'm too scared of Kate. She's such a dragon.
,That's true. She's so unfriendly and scary. She'll probably shout at you.
,Oh, that doesn't sound good. You should go to the Doctor's.
,I can't face dealing with that dragon at reception. She's always so rude and aggressive.
,Yeah, she's the last thing you want to deal with when you're ill.
,Ah, now I see that to call someone a dragon in English means something very different to Chinese.
,In those examples we have just heard they were using it to describe unfriendly and frightening women.
,Can this be right? Neil, are you calling me unfriendly and scary?
,Erm. yes. Recently.
,Not strong, courageous and determined? This is what we mean in Chinese when we call someone a dragon.
,No, I'm afraid not. We use 'dragon' to describe a woman who is unfriendly and frightening.
,Oh, that's very interesting.
,Yes it is, isn't it?
,oh,Hang on, hang on. What do you mean I'm unfriendly? How dare you call me unfriendly.
,Well, not usually but recently you have been.
,You just wait. I will get my revenge on you for this, you little upstart. Who do you think you are?
,Now you're getting scary.
,I'll show you what a dragon can do. OK, Li I think I'm going to leave now before you start breathing fire.
,Breathing fire? I'll burn you till you're toast.
,
,Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Helen.
,And I'm Steve. How are you, Helen?
,Actually, I'm feeling very positive, thanks Steve.
,Why? What's happened?
,Well, I found out on Friday that I'm getting a promotion at BBC Learning English, then on Saturday I won ￡1,000 on the lottery.
,Wow, that's brilliant.
,Yes, and then on Sunday it got even better. I found out that some paintings I've done are going to be displayed at an art gallery in London.
,That's amazing, Helen, you're on a roll at the moment, aren't you.
,Er, I'm on a what?
,On a roll.
,Roll? I don't roll. I walk, or sometimes I run if I want some exercise. A football rolls if I kick it across the ground.
,Sure, a football rolls, but you can be on a roll. It means you're experiencing lots of success or good luck at the moment.
,I see, the phrase 'on a roll' means you are having lots of good luck in your life. Let's listen to an example.
,I hear your sister's getting married.
,Yeah, she met this amazing guy while she was working in the theatre in London, and six months later they're engaged.
,And then, yesterday she was offered the lead part in the theatre's new play. She's really on a roll.
,So that woman is excited because her sister is on a roll, she met an amazing guy who she's now engaged to, and then she was offered the lead part in a play.
,Yes, if you're on a roll it means lots of things are going well for you at the moment. Here’s another example.
,How are Arsenal doing in the Premier League these days?
,Oh, they're totally on a roll. They've won all three games this month, including the one against Man United.
,So that man thinks his favourite football team are on a roll because they've won all their games?
,Yes, they've won every game they've played this month, they're playing really well.
,Oh, oh. Wait a second. I've got a text message from my husband.
,What's he saying, have you won the lottery again? Are you still on a roll?
,Sound effect of car braking suddenly.
,No, actually, he's just had his bike stolen, and earlier he lost his car keys.
,Oh, dear, that's bad luck! Unlike you, he's definitely not on a roll.
,No, I'd better go and help him look for those keys. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hi I'm Jennifer and I'm waiting for Helen. I did see her in the corridor earlier, and she was looking a bit unhappy. Wait, here she is.
,Hi Helen.
,Hi Jen.
,What's the matter, Helen? Why the long face?
,What's wrong with my face?
,Nothing's wrong with your face, except that it looks a bit upset.
,But you just said I've got a long face.
,No, what I said was.
,You think I've got a strange face. I knew I shouldn't have worn my hair like this today.
,No, I asked you, "Why the long face?"
,Is it my nose? Is it too big? Or maybe my chin is the wrong shape. Maybe I should just wear a big bag over my head.
,No, no, no. That's not what I meant. First of all, you look lovely today.
,So what did you mean?
,In English, the expression "why the long face" is used as an informal way of asking someone what's wrong if they look upset.
,So there's nothing wrong with my face?
,No, there isn't. Let's hear some examples of the phrase in use.
,You've just got a new job, a new house and a new man. you should be happy. Why the long face?
,Hey there, don't look so sad. Why the long face?
,So "why the long face" is just another way of asking "what's the matter".
,Exactly. You could also say "what's up".
,That's very simple. You could say "what's wrong" too.
,So what IS wrong? Why do you look so miserable?
,I've just had a really bad day. Everything has gone wrong. First I lost my car keys, then I was late for a meeting and I fell over and landed in a puddle on my way.
,It was a horrible day.
,It sounds awful. I know, how about I tell you a joke to cheer you up. You'll like this one.
,OK, why not. Let's hear it.
,A horse walks into a bar. The barman says, "why the long face?"
,So the horse was unhappy? What's funny about that?
,The barman says to the horse "Why the long face?"
,Why would a horse be in a bar?
,It doesn't matter. It's a joke. It's a horse so the barman says "Why the long face?"
,I don't understand.
,The horse has a long face.
, So it's unhappy?
,No, well, yes, but that's the joke. Horses have long faces.
,So why did it go into the bar again? I don't get it.
,
,Hello, I'm Helen and I'm here today to co-present The English We Speak and the presenter is Rosie. Where is she?
,Hi, I'm Rosie. Hi Helen. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic, you know?
,Is it that bad? I live in North London, like you, and I've managed to be here on time. Maybe you should take a different route so you wouldn't be late anymore.
,Yesterday you were a bit late too. And the day before. I saw when you arrived in the middle of an important meeting. This is not good.
,I know. The boss was not pleased and he called me afterwards into his office. He says he will throw the book at me.
,Oh, that's bad. That's very bad.
,Yes, it is. I'm very concerned now. I know that I should be more careful.
, They are very big. Have you seen these massive encyclopaedias he keeps on the dark wooden shelves behind his desk?
,He's not into electronic books and neither into those so-called paperbacks. The man likes heavy leather cover traditional books and old collectors' antiques and furniture.
,I know he likes antiques, that does not bother me.
,He's going to throw the book at me, Helen. He said it yesterday. He sounded very angry, very crossed and he said,
,"Rosie, it's happening too often now. You're always late for meetings, for programmes, you have been absent frequently and I'm going to throw the book at you."
,That's what he said, Helen.
,Oh, the books are heavy and you might get seriously hurt. He's a strong man, maybe he will throw the other things too.
,Oh, I don't like to see him angry. He is a good boss but he's got a temper.
,There's that Queen Victoria bust from the 19th century he loves. It's an antique too, if you get him angry enough he might even throw the bust on you.
,Queen Victoria's bust? Eh what are you talking about?
,Helen, in English, to throw the book at somebody means to impose the maximum penalty on somebody who has been breaking the rules.
,The book is supposed to be the list of rules and regulations and the expression is used by people in a position of authority. Let's listen to some examples.
,Mr Jones, I'm tired of seeing you in my courtroom! If you don't stop trying to steal cars I'm going to throw the book at you. You'll face a long prison sentence.
,I'm sorry, Judge. I think I've learnt my lesson now and will behave properly.
,I'm your teacher. Pay attention to what I'm saying. If you continue cheating in your exams I'm going to throw the book at you.
,Oh, I see. So he will not actually pick up that heavy Encyclopaedia Britannica and throw it in your direction and hurt you.
,Of course not. He probably will send me a formal letter and start disciplinary procedures with the human resources department and might end up sacking me.
,But at least you will not be hurt and the book will be preserved. I like that book, you know.
,When I was a child I used to enjoy looking up things in encyclopaedias, they're very interesting. This was before the internet was so accessible.
,It doesn't matter what happens to his old books, Helen. This is serious. It might not hurt me but it will hurt my pocket. No job, no money.
,Well, if you don't want him to sack you, then buy a watch and don't come late anymore. Follow the rules.
,And I don't want to finish the programme late. Nobody will throw the book at me. Goodbye.
,I will buy a new watch. Thank you for the advice. Bye.
,
,No, come on. Don't do it. Don't do it.
,Li, she's an actress in a film, she can't hear you. And besides, it's rude to talk in the cinema.
,But it's just so frustrating. Don't go into the house. Don't do it. Oh, no. I can't watch.
,Li, shut up.
,I know, he has shut her up in that house and won't let her go. She's his prisoner now.
,No, Li. I was telling you to shut up. It's a rude way of saying "Be quiet."
,Excuse me, will you please shut up?
,I'm really sorry. Li, I can't take you anywhere.
,Oh well look, the film is over now, anyway. Sorry about the talking, but I just get a bit carried away.
,Well, I'm sorry I told you to shut up. It is quite a rude expression in English, but you just kept talking and wouldn't shut up.
,So can I tell someone to shut up when they're making noise?
,You can, but it's informal and can be rude. So, if you're in a formal context, you should say something like "Could you please be quiet?"
,OK, so in a meeting, if someone is speaking, I won't tell them to shut up. I'll say, "Could you please be quiet?"
,But if I'm really annoyed at one of my friends, I can tell them to shut up.
,Yes, although sometimes it's used when people are joking in English. Let's listen to some examples.
,I'm so tired. And thirsty. When are we going to get there? If only you'd drive a bit faster.
,Will you please shut up? I can't concentrate with your constant moaning.
,I look fat in this dress. It's so clingy.
,Oh shut up! You look great.
,I just read the whole book in an hour.
,Shut up. No one can read that quickly.
,So in that first example, we heard the expression "shut up" used in a serious way.
,But in the second and third examples, it doesn't mean we want someone to be quiet. It means, "I don't believe you" or "Don't be ridiculous."
,So when someone says something silly or ridiculous, we can say "shut up".
,And again, we only really do this with people we know well as it is informal. You hav been warned.
,Well, one thing's for sure, I'm never, and I mean never, going to the cinema with you again.
,Shut up. I don't believe you. You love going to the cinema with me. I always buy you popcorn.
,Shut up. I always get the popcorn.
,Oh, shut up.
,You shut up.
,No you shut up.
,
,Hi, I'm Rob. And this is Helen.
,Hello.
,Now come on Helen, we've no time to waste. This jumble sale has nearly finished and we haven't got any bargains yet.
,Yes, all I've bought is an old teddy bear and a hat with a hole in it.
,A jumble sale is a great place to pick up some second-hand goods but make sure they are things you want. So what are you looking for Rob?
,Well, some antique pots and some vases. And then I can sell it to someone else and I'll be quids in.
,What? Quids in? What a strange saying.
,Well, it means I'll be in profit, or I will have made or saved some money through some kind of financial transaction.
,I like the sound of that. But did you say squids in, like the creature in the sea, a squid?
,No nothing like that Helen, the word is quids, it's a slang word for pounds. A quid is ?1. You might hear people talking about it like this:
,I'm broke so can you lend me a quid to buy a cup of tea, please?
,Come on ladies, who wants these lovely strawberries? Only two quid a box.
,So a quid is a pound and if I am quids in it means I will have made some extra pounds sterling.
,Ah, why didn't you say? Quids in means you could be rich.
,Possibly possibly. But let's hear some other people who are hoping to be quids in.
,If we complete this deal, we'll be quids in.
,With such a good exchange rate you'll be quids in when you go abroad on holiday.
,I paid ?50 for it but sold it for ?60 so I'm quids in.
,The English we speak.
,OK Rob, if we're going to be quids in today we need to get buying things.
,Did I say "we"? Anyway, look at this old vase, it's only ?10. I could clean it up and sell it for ?20.
,Sounds fantastic. We really would be quids in then. Come on then let's buy it.
,Right OK, so I've got my bargain for today, let's go home.
,Rob watch that step!
,Whoa. Oh no, my vase. It's broken.
,Oh. Do you think you'll be able to get ?20 for it now?
,No, I won't even get a penny.
,Rob won't be making a profit on selling his old vase now it's broken. Is there such an expression as being quids out?
,No there isn't. But there is an expression about being out of pocket.
,Hmm, I think we'll leave that for another day. Come on Rob I'll buy you a drink to cheer you up.
,Thanks Helen. See you next time on The English We Speak. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob.
,And hello I'm Li.
,Shh shh Li, quiet please. I need to concentrate, the race is about to finish and I've got a bet on. Yeah yeah. I've won. I've actually won. I'm rich.
,Well done Rob. So what have you won Rob?
,Ten pounds.
,Oh just ten pounds. Ah well, that's quite useful actually.
,Oh, is it. Why is that?
,Well, you owe me five pounds and you did say you would buy me a glass of champagne if you won a race.
,Oh right, did I? So, that will leave me with. 50 pence. Maybe I'm not a winner after all. Honestly! Every time I make some money I have to give it away.
,Sorry Rob, it's a no-win situation or a lose-lose situation. Rob, you can't gain any money because you'll always lose it on something else.
,So even though I did win something, I have also lost. So that's a no-win situation is it?
,I'm afraid it is. A no-win situation is one in which a favourable outcome is impossible. You are bound to lose whatever you do.
,You can also use this phrase to describe situations that aren't just to do with money, like this.
,I can get the bus or train to work, either way I'm going to be late. It's a no-win situation.
,The cafe only served ham or beef sandwiches but as a vegetarian I was in a no-win situation.
,If she helps in the garden, Mum won't be pleased and if she helps in the kitchen, Dad won't be pleased. She really is in a no-win situation.
,So a no-win situation is one that is certain to end in failure and disappointment. So Rob I can see you are disappointed because you have spent your winnings on me.
,Um, I am I'm afraid. It seems impossible to win money just for myself.
,Actually I also won some money, 50 pounds, so I'll buy you a drink, in fact I'll buy you something to eat too and you don't need to pay me back that five pounds.
,Really? Li that's very kind of you. So now I'm in a win-win situation.
,Yes, the opposite of a no-win situation is a win-win situation. This is where there is a favourable outcome for everyone involved. Like this.
,The house buyer got a good price and the seller was happy to sell quickly so it was a win-win situation.
,If I get to invest your money in the company and you get to share the profits, it's a win-win situation.
,So, in a win-win situation everyone is happy. Just like our situation now. So, where are you taking me for dinner Li?
,Did I say dinner? I was just going to buy you a sandwich.
,Oh. That's not such a good win-win situation, is it?
,Maybe I'll buy you some chips too.
,OK great. Come on then, let's go. Bye bye.
,Bye bye.
,
,Ah Vera, it's great that you've come with me during our lunch break to do some shopping. I need to buy a suit to go to a wedding and I have to look very smart.
,And I will make sure of that, Rob. Everybody says I have good taste. I've always chosen my husband's and my son's pyjamas and they look good while they sleep!
,Rob, I love that grey suit in the window.
,Wow. It looks really smart, actually. It will make me look great.
,Exactly! Let's go into the shop, you must try it.
,The colour suits you, Sir. I will see if I can find a smaller size so that it fits you perfectly.
,You see, Rob. This salesman knows what he is talking about. He thinks it looks good on you.
,But he is right, a size smaller would fit better. And everybody in the wedding will think you are a powerful man.
,Yes. Oh wait Vera, this suit is not for me. I'm reading this label and it says it costs an arm and a leg.
,An arm and a leg!? This is terrible, Rob. It's barbaric. This is the 21st century, not the Middle Ages.
,And the salesman seems quite civilised.He sounded like a nice man who wouldn't demand your limbs.
,Don't worry, Vera. I will keep all of my limbs. In English, when we say something costs an arm and a leg we mean that it is very expensive.
,So, it is something people say but it doesn't actually involve arms and legs. That's a relief.
,Let's hear some examples while I get back into my old clothes.
,I'd like to travel all over Europe, but the air fare might cost me an arm and a leg.
,You have to pay a lot of money to give your children a good education nowadays. A place in a top university costs an arm and a leg.
,So, what expression do you use when you want to say that something's very, very expensive?
,You might say it costs an arm and a leg.
,Yeah. Now let's leave this expensive suit here and get out of the shop before that posh-sounding salesman comes back.
,Good idea. He will look down on us, Rob. But I would pay a nail and an elbow for that scarf there and that red dress over there, it might cost a foot and a knee.
,Oh, look at that handbag. It's a designer one and must cost an ear and a hand.
,What are you talking about, Vera? We only say "an arm and a leg". Now, quickly, let's get out of here.
,OK, OK. Bye.
,
,Hi Helen. I thought I would pop round to talk to you about today's Authentic Real English, but err, it looks like you're busy.
,What are all these police cars doing here?
,Quick, come in, shut the door, now this is very serious. There has been a murder.
,What?
,A murder. I know it's not very nice, but to be honest the police can't find any blood or a body. It's like a murder mystery.
,Hmm,a murder mystery,well we need to do our own investigation. So what exactly happened?
,Well, my friend came to see me this morning.
,I see.
,And we were having a nice chat when she said I could murder a coffee and then she disappeared and I haven't heard from her since.
,Right. Well Helen, I think you can relax, I think she's still alive and everything is ok.
,There's no murder?
,No murder. When people say they could murder something it's an informal way of saying they are starving or thirsty and are desperate to have something to eat or drink.
,But murder is a strong word.
,Yes. It stresses how desperate someone is for something. A direct translation would mean you are so desperate for something you would kill it.
,But in reality, we don't go that far.
,Thank goodness.
,Here are some more examples.
,It's been a really tough day at work, I could murder a beer or two, anyone want to join me at the pub?
,I'm starving, I could murder a curry.
,the English we speak
,It's amazing what people will commit murder for. But in reality when we would murder for something, we just have a desperate need for something.
,People also describe a situation or a feeling as murder, but again there is no killing involved. They are just trying to explain that something is bad or uncomfortable.
,So the word murder is also used to emphasise a bad situation or uncomfortable feeling. Such as Rob?
,Such as in these examples.
,Running a marathon is murder on my knees.
,I've been decorating all day and my back is murder.
,Don't go on the London underground during the rush hour, it's murder.
,the English we speak
,So by saying "it's murder" he means it's awful. It's terrible. Anyway Helen, now we know there's not been a real murder, I think we should tell these policemen to go home now.
,Good idea. Excuse me, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. There's not been a murder so you can all go home.
,Oh right. So we've been wasting our time then? But hold on, I think there might be another murder soon.
,Oh, why's that?
,Well, I could murder a cup of tea.
,Of course.
,I'll put the kettle on. Bye.
,Bye.
,Policeman: Milk, two sugars please!
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. Rosie and I are doing a salsa class tonight. It's my favourite Latin American dance and I love the music.
,Yes, and it's not easy. One, two, three. Oh, I'm not very good yet. I'm still finding my feet.
,You're still finding your feet? No wonder you're so bad. How can you dance if you don't know where your feet are?
,I do know where my feet are, Helen. When you say you're finding your feet in English, it means you're becoming confident at something.
,So if I say I'm still finding my feet, it means I'm still getting used to a new situation, which might not have anything to do with feet?
,That's right. And when you say you've found your feet, it means you've become familiar with a situation.
,Let's have a look at some examples then.
,Lauren has only been at her new job for four days, so she's still finding her feet.
,My daughter started secondary school two weeks ago. She's already found her feet. She's made loads of new friends and really likes her teachers.
, I've been living in Egypt for a year but I still can't speak Arabic very well. I'm sure you'll find your feet soon.
,So finding your feet has nothing to do with your actual feet. You can use it when you start a new job or when you're doing something new.
,That's right. And I feel like I'm getting quite good at salsa now.
,Really? It looks like you're still finding your feet.
,I might ask someone to dance with me, Helen. That guy over there is pretty good.
,Hi, would you like to dance?
,Oh, OK.
,Oooooh this is fun. One, two, three.
,Oops
,Sorry. Did I step on your foot?
,Ouch.
,It looks like Rosie's doing more than finding her feet. She's finding other people's feet and stepping on them too.
,
,Hi, I'm Yang Li, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm here today with Jen.
,Hi.
,Jen, you look a little flustered? Are you ok?
,Oh, I woke up late and had to run to the train station.
,There's only one train an hour. I ran all the way there and made it by the skin of my teeth, just as the doors were closing.
,Phew. Is there any coffee?
,Hang on hang on. How did your teeth help you to run for the train?
,Sorry?
,You said "I made it by the skin of my teeth." I've got to see this. Show me your teeth. When did they grow skin?
,No, there's no skin on my teeth. That would be disgusting.
,But but what did you mean?
,If you do something "by the skin of your teeth" it means that you did it by a narrow margin, so you just managed to do it, or almost failed.
,Ah see, so if you got to the train by the skin of your teeth, it means that you nearly missed it?
,That's exactly right. Let's hear some more examples of the phrase in action.
,My brother's so lucky. He never does any revision for exams but always manages to pass by the skin of his teeth.
,Hi, I'm stuck in a traffic jam. I might still make it to the presentation, but it'll be by the skin of my teeth.
,So when you just manage to do something, you can say you did it by the skin of your teeth?
,That's it.
,That's a really funny phrase. I like it.
,It's good to be able to get your teeth into English phrases like this.
,My teeth? What about my teeth?
,It's just another phrase, silly. If you get your teeth into something, it means that you become really involved in it.
,Well in that case, I do love getting my teeth into a new phrase.
,Teeth, hang on. Oh no, oh I've just remembered, I have a dentist's appointment at 12 o'clock.
,Look it's ten to 12 now, I'll never make it.
,You go, I'll finish the programme, if you run you might make it, but by the skin of your teeth.
,Oh thanks Jen, bye…
,
,Hi Helen. Wow, what's that?
,It's a present for you, Chris.
,A present for me? Oh, that's very kind of you.
,Here you go.
,A new dictionary, how nice. That's such a lovely present, and it's not even my birthday.
,But hang on, why have you stuck all these pieces of string onto the book?
,There are strings to your present.
,I see. Do you mean there are certain conditions that come with this present?
,Yes, strings to your present.
,Ahh, you mean there are strings attached.
,I see, so it's an expression in English?
,That's right. Having strings attached doesn't actually mean you need to stick pieces of string on the book.
,You can just tell me what the conditions are.
,Oh, OK. Well, the conditions are that I can borrow your dictionary whenever I need to use it.
,That's absolutely fine. You can borrow it anytime.
,Great. Do you have any headphones I can use too? I want to listen to my mp3 player.
,Yes, here you go.
,Thanks. Are there any strings attached?
,No, you can use the headphones for as long as you like. No strings attached.
,Wonderful, thanks very much.
,Let's take a listen to some examples of how strings attached or no strings attached can be used.
,Make sure you read all of the contract before you sign it, there could be strings attached.
,We're giving away our brand new toy to the first 50 customers who visit our shop. No strings attached.
,So it can be a warning about whether there are restrictions to something or not.
,That's right. When something has strings attached, it often means there are hidden commitments and you should find out what they are.
,That's good to know. Is it just used when talking about money?
,It can often be used when talking about financial agreements or negotiations,
,but it can also be based on personal relationships too, like when you gave me the present. Here's another example.
,My brother said I could use his car this weekend, no strings attached.
,Really? That's a nice thing to do.
,Well, he does owe me a favour after I washed the car last week.
,So Helen, now that you've finished with your mp3 player, can I listen to it?
,You can, but there are strings attached.
,Oh, OK. What are they?
,My mp3 player has only got classical music on it.
,Oh no, I hate classical music.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Rob.
,And hello, my name is Helen.
,Hold on Helen, hold on. We can't hear you properly. I think your microphone is playing up.
,Playing up?
,Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
,Let me just push this button. Oh There! Hello. Now, you said the microphone was playing up?
,That's right. It wasn't working properly. If something isn't working as it should be, we sometimes say it's playing up.
,Up – not down?
,Nope. Playing down is a different expression that means something totally different.
,OK. So as the picture on my TV at home is flickering, I can say my TV is playing up?
,Exactly. Let's hear about some other things that are playing up.
,I don't think I'll be able to give you a lift to work today, my car's been playing up.
,Oh,my phone keeps playing up. Every time I dial a number, it just switches itself off.
,That sounds like my phone! So if something isn't doing what is should do then it's misbehaving?
,Ha Ha! Well, you could say that. It's just like people. When they misbehave we can say they're playing up. Like this…
,Sorry but I'm going to be late. The children have been playing up and I've still got so much to do.
,BBC Learning English.
,Oh,children are very good at playing up;it's usually because they want attention.
,Now, Helen, could I have your attention now please .
,Because playing up is also something you can say to describe a part of your body that's not working properly.
,Ow! Ow! I'm going to have to lie down; my back's playing up again.
,Count me out of this weekend's football match; my leg's playing up so I need to rest it.
,So it seems playing up refers to anything that's not working or behaving as it should.
,Now Rob, my leg's also been playing up so I wonder if you could give me a lift home in your car?
,No way - oh it looks like my microphone's playing up now!
,No, Rob, it's you who's playing up - now switch it back on!
,Oh, Oh, OK. Then, Helen!
,Let's go then. Bye!
,Bye.
,
,Hi, I'm Neil and this is Helen.
,Hello.
,What's wrong Helen? You're looking rather sheepish.
,Sheepish? Like a sheep? I know my jumper is quite woolly.
,No, I don't mean you look like a sheep. I mean you look sheepish, which is quite different.
,Of course, looking like a sheep and looking sheepish are two totally different things, obviously.
,Yes. If I say you look like a sheep, it means, well, you look like a sheep.
,But if I say you look sheepish, it means you look embarrassed or ashamed about something.
,To look sheepish means you look embarrassed or ashamed, like you've done something wrong or silly?
,Yes.
,Ah, yes.
,Listen to some examples.
,Tom walked into the room looking sheepish.
,Emily grinned sheepishly as she closed the door behind her.
,James gave her a sheepish look.
,So, come on Helen, why are you looking sheepish today?
,Ah, well.
,Yes?
,Well, you know that book you lent me?
,You mean my favourite book of all time, the original edition of The Private lives of the Greatest Cats in History?
,Yes.
,OK Helen, now you're looking very sheepish indeed, so you'd better hurry up and tell me what happened to it.
,I dropped it.
,You dropped it? Well I hope it's not damaged, otherwise I'll have to...
,In the river.
,In the river. You dropped it in the river.
,It was carried away, I couldn't get it out.
,Oh no.
,I'm so sorry. That's why I am looking sheepish.
,You should be looking even more sheepish than that. In fact, I expect you to look sheepish for several days.
,It was the best book in the world! "Sheepish" doesn't do it justice...
,
,Hello. I'm Neil.
,I'm Helen. And Neil is speaking in that rather strange voice because he's in a strange position.
,That's right. I'm bending over backwards, or trying to.
,Bending over backwards. The problem is that you're not very flexible are you?
,No. Even if I bend forwards I can hardly touch my knees, and certainly not my toes.
,Well, look at me!
,Wow, Helen, I had no idea you could do that. You can bend over backwards all the way to the floor!
,Yes. Anyway, maybe we should explain why we're bending over backwards.
,Oh, yes, of course. That's because today's phrase is
,To bend over backwards!
,Listen to these examples and see if you can guess what it means.
,I would bend over backwards for you, just let me know how I can help.
,Julia bent over backwards to make sure everything was right for their visit.
,Did you guess the meaning of 'to bend over backwards'?
,It means to go to great lengths or to put in a lot of effort for someone or something.
,Like "I would bend over backwards to make you happy", Helen.
,Ahhhh. Thank you Neil. Let's hear some more examples.
,I bent over backwards to get Jim what he wanted, but he never thanked me.
,I'll help you a bit, but don't expect me to bend over backwards.
,Oh, ooof.
,Are you okay?
,I need to sit down, I think I've hurt my back.
,Ah, Neil, you must be careful not to bend over backwards too often.
,Yes.
,Or you should just bend over backwards figuratively, but not literally. That's all for now. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hi and welcome to The English We Speak. Today we're having an office party with the whole BBC Learning English team.
,And we're eating some delicious cakes and pies that Jen has baked for us. Have you tried the apple tart?
,Mmm, it's so tasty. Jen really has a lot of different skills, doesn't she?
,Yeah, she really gets involved in lots of different activities.
,She's always organising different parties, goes rowing, and did you know she works as a weather presenter at the weekend?
,And she's a good cook too. This blueberry crumble is delicious. She really does have a finger in every pie.
,Ugh, really? I mean they taste good, but now I know she puts her fingers in them. I think I've just lost my appetite.
,That's not what I meant when I said she has a finger in every pie. It means she gets involved in a lot of different things.
,So someone has a finger in every pie when they're involved in different activities? Is it a good thing then?
,Well, in this case, when I said Jen has a finger in every pie, I meant it as a good thing.
,But it can sometimes suggest someone gets involved in things when they shouldn't.
,So it can be a good or a bad thing. Let's have a look at some examples.
,If you need any information just ask Annabel. She has a finger in every pie and always knows the answer.
,At work I'm a teacher but I also do some accounting and organise the end-of-term play. I like to have a finger in every pie.
,I can't seem to do anything without him being there. Yesterday I went to the photography club and he was there.
,Well, unfortunately he does have a finger in every pie.
,So if someone gets involved in too many different things and people disapprove of this, it can be used as a criticism.
,Yes, and Shakespeare used it in his play Henry VIII.
,In the play it's used as a criticism of someone who gets involved in everything when he shouldn't.
,No man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger.
,So the person criticised here feels the need to put his "ambitious finger" in every single pie that's baked to taste them all.
,Yes, which means he gets involved in things he shouldn't.
,But Shakespeare used the expression in a slightly different way from how we use it today.
,Now we just say someone has a finger in every pie.
,Yes, it's slightly less poetic than "no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger".
,Well, this is all very interesting, but I haven't tried the peach pie yet.
,Well, no pie is freed from Helen's greedy fingers, is it? Only joking, Helen.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Callum Robertson.
,And I'm Yang Li.
,Come 'ere then! Oi! Come on then! Want a fight? Who are ya?
,Oh, Callum! Who are all those horrible men that I can hear on my headphones?
,Well, Li, they are yobs.
,Yobs?
,Yes, yobs. Yob is our phrase for today. It's an informal word that refers to a man who is loud and rude and possibly rather violent.
,Oh, that sounds like you!
,What are you talking about, sounds like me? What do you mean? Are you asking for a fight?
,No, no, no! But do you see what I mean? You sound like a yob.
,Hmm, yes, OK. Sorry about that.
,Hmm, anyway, I chose this word because as many people will know the UK recently experienced some violence on the streets of London and other cities.
,'Yob' is a word that the British press used to describe the rioters.
,Let's hear some real headlines from some British newspapers
,UK riots: 11 councils to evict 'riot yobs'.
,Ken Clarke blames 'feral' yobs.
,600 riot yobs left DNA on windows.
,Riot yobs filmed attacking cop cars.
,Riot yobs can't hide.
,UK riots: young yobs back on streets despite David Cameron's pledge.
,Ah, I'm not sure I remember seeing this word yob on the BBC news site.
,Well, no. It's a very negative and judgemental word. The BBC tends to avoid this kind of language in its news stories.
,But this is a piece of British slang that is very common in the UK.
,And we also sometimes use the word yobbo.
,Yobbo. Hmm, but where do all these words come from?
,Well, interestingly, what we have here is an example of backslang.
,If you read the word yob backwards, what do you get?
,Hmm, B.O.Y., boy.
,Exactly. And that's what the word used to mean, but now it refers to a rude and violent man, often a young man but not always.
, Listen Callum, I'm sorry about earlier. I don't really think you are a yob. You are a gentleman.
,Oh, thanks Li.
,But in any case you know if we were to get in a fight I would beat you. So don't you try that again!
,OK.
,
,So, how are you feeling, Vera?
,Oh Thank you for visiting me here in hospital, Rob.
,I feel awful. Oh my leg is broken, my chin is bruised and my pride is hurt. I had a silly fall while I was skiing over the weekend.
,Oh, bad luck, really. But your leg will heal and your bruises will disappear soon, Vera. There will be no sign of them in a few weeks' time.
,Yes, I know Rob. But now I'm in pain. I'm in pain.
,Oh oh but you'll get better, Vera. Just keep your chin up.
,Keep my chin up?
,Keep my chin up might be a new form of treatment. Rob has always been very knowledgeable of these alternative medicines and treatments.
,Perhaps it is good for circulation.
,Is it good for circulation, Rob?
,No Vera, it doesn't help your circulation! Keep your chin up but well, what are you doing? That's not what I mean.
,It's not what you mean?! My chin is up now. Isn't it high enough? Will it help my bruises disappear, Rob?
,Not really. But it will make you feel better, Vera.
,How come, Rob?
,In English, when we tell someone to keep their chin up, we are telling them to stay positive in a tough situation.
,Let's listen to some examples.
,When young people say it is difficult to earn a living nowadays, I tell them to work hard, keep their chin up and they will go places.
,I've just had an argument with my husband. My daughter said she wants to leave school and my cat ran away.
,I feel like crying. Sometimes it's hard to keep my chin up.
,Ah, I've got it. When you want to tell someone to remain positive in a tough situation, you say "keep your chin up" That's a relief, Rob.
,My chin was feeling even more painful than it was before.
,Well, you can relax now. And next time you go to some slope for some skiing make sure you stay on the nursery slopes.
,Nursery? But that's where children do their skiing. That's for kids.
,No, not just for kids, Vera, for beginners too. Anyway, don't be angry. Keep your chin up.
,With a lot of training, one day you'll be a great skier.
,Yes, maybe you are right. If I keep my chin up and train a lot, one day I will be a great skier.
,Good. Well, bye for now.
,Bye.
,
,Hi there Li.
,Oh, hi Chris.
,Are you alright? You seem annoyed?
,Oh, I'm fed up. I had to stay late at work again yesterday.
,I still didn't manage to finish all the work, so I came in early today as well.
,Sounds like you need a cup of tea. I'll put the kettle on.
,What have you got to finish?
,Well, it's not even my work I have to finish. It's Lisa's.
,What do you mean?
,Since she started, she's always asking me to do her work for her.
,She'll start it, and then give it to me to complete, then leave early while I have to stay late to get it all done.
,Oh, I know how you feel. Lisa did the same thing to me last week. She's really difficult to work with.
,Normally I wouldn't give her the time of day, but she is the manager's secretary.
,You wouldn't give her the time of day? What time?
,No, no. It's an expression, a negative expression. What I meant was I wouldn't normally pay attention to her.
,It's a bit of an unfriendly expression to use. Here are some examples.
,After the way Dave talked about me during the meeting, I wouldn't give him the time of day.
,Politicians are all the same. They're never honest. I wouldn't give any of them the time of day.
,Long ago, in Shakespeare's time, the phrase "good time of day" was a greeting often used. These days we say "good morning".
,Or "good afternoon".
,That's right. So to say that you wouldn't give someone the time of day means you wouldn't want to greet them or say hello.
,So the saying means you refuse to give someone your attention.
,Oh, I see.
,But sadly we can't avoid some people in the office, no matter how hard we try.
,Well, I'd better get back to work. I've got so much to do.
,well,good luck. Let me know if you need any help.
,Thanks Chris. See you later.
,
,Rob I don't know why we have to stand up when we present this programme. It's quite tiring.
,Really? But I thought standing up would give us more energy and sitting down makes us a bit lazy.
,But I've been standing up all day, this is my only chance to sit down.
,Why didn't you say. Here, have a chair, take the weight off your feet.
,The weight? Do you mean I'm heavy and my feet can't carry the weight?
,Helen don't be so sensitive. I was being kind. It's a way of saying, relax, sit down, especially after standing up for a long time. ?
,It's got nothing to do with your actual weight.
,Oh I see. To take the weight off your feet. In that case I will.
,OK, and here are some other ways of saying the phrase.
,We've been shopping all day, let's take the weight off our feet, sit down and have a cup of coffee.
,Don't walk to work today, go on the bus and take the weight off your feet.
,Those are different ways of taking the weight off your feet.
,I have to admit Rob, it's very comfortable sitting down. I feel quite relaxed I think I'll put my feet up too.
,Wow, that's another expression we use, to put our feet up.
,Again it means rest and relax and literally, put your feet up on the sofa, or in your case, on the desk.
,Helen you could have taken your shoes off.
,Sorry. To put your feet up Ahh, lovely. Can we hear some more examples please?
,Yes Helen.
,You've been gardening all day, come inside and put your feet up.
,After working for the company for 30 years, Jim has decided it's time to finally put his feet up and retire.
,If he's retiring he'll be putting his feet up for a long time. But Helen we've got work to do, so back on your feet.
,You want me to put the weight on my feet now?
,I'm afraid so. It's time to go shopping.
,Shopping. Why didn't you say.
,Look, I'm back on my feet now.
,That was quick. OK, best foot forward, off to the supermarket we go, left, right, left right.
,Yes, the supermarket Helen. Bye!
,Bye.
,Come on now . Left, right, left right, keep moving those feet.
,
,Hi, I'm Rosie, and this is Li…
,Li? Hurry up. Look, here's the karaoke bar.
,Ahhh. Rosie, why is the bar on the top floor? So many stairs. Help me please. I'm so unfit.
,I need to start doing more exercise. I'm going to join the gym tomorrow.
,Tomorrow? Why don't you join the gym today?
,I'll join it tomorrow and then I'll go every single day. I will. I really will.
,Li, you've been saying that for months but you never actually do it!
,This time I will, I promise.
,That's what you always say. You need to put your money where your mouth is.
,You want me to put my money where my mouth is?
,You want me to eat my coins and banknotes? That's disgusting.
,No, Li, that's not what I meant.
,To put your money where your mouth is means to stop just talking about something and to take action.
,Ah, so you didn't really want me to put all these coins in my mouth?
,No, please don't. I want you to stop talking about joining the gym, and to join it for real.
,Here are some more examples.
,If we played a game of tennis I would easily win.
,Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? I challenge you to a game.
,So to put your money where your mouth is means to support your words with actions?
,Yes.
,so you'd say you’re one of those people who puts their money where their mouth is?
,Definitely.
,That's interesting actually. So the other day you were saying that you love singing, and here we are in a karaoke bar.
,Well yes but, I'm really terrible actually. And some of our colleagues are here, how embarrassing.
,No excuses. Put your money where your mouth is and sing a karaoke song.
,Oh, do I have to? OK. Here we go.
,Near far wherever you are .I believe that the heart does go on.
,Maybe just maybe, sometimes it's best not to put your money where your mouth is.
,
,Hi and welcome to another edition of The English We Speak. Today I'm joined by Neil, who seems to be a bit agitated.
,Ah, sorry Li. I'm really, really excited.
,Actually, I haven't even got a script for the programme. I don't need a script. I don't need anything! I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams.
,Oh, that's nice. How come that you've got rich all of a sudden?
,A Mercedes Benz and a Porsche. And then a boat, then a yacht. A big one!
,Neil, what happened? You are going bananas.
, Bananas? No cheap old fruit for me any more, caviar, champagne, lobster and…
,I'm not offering you bananas. You are not listening. I'm saying that you have gone bananas!
,Sorry Li. I'm very excited because I won the lottery.
,You know, this week they've got this big jackpot to offer and I got all the numbers right.
,Good on you.
,"To go bananas" has nothing to do with food, as you know.
,It's an expression in English we use when we are so excited that we act almost out of control.
,It is a very odd expression. We'd better let people know how it is used.
,Good idea.
,Let me write my shopping list while we listen to some examples of the use of this expression that has nothing to do with the actual fruit.
,Here they are.
,I'm so happy that I finally got my promotion. Yesterday I went bananas.
,I ended up running around the office, hugging and kissing my boss and every single co-worker.
,They probably thought I was mad.
,After the team scored its fourth goal in the final the fans went bananas and started to shout and jump up and down.
,So "to go bananas" is not an expression about food but about behaviour.
,It means to behave in a very over-enthusiastic way, like you've gone crazy, an explosion of happiness.
,That's true. All this excitement has made me want to go out shopping too.
,I'll get myself a toy boat to play with in my bathtub and down the park, in the lake.
,And then I'm going to the zoo.
,The zoo? Why the zoo?
,Because All this conversation about bananas made me keen to watch the monkeys.
,I might give them some very big, shiny and tasty bananas, bright yellow, the colour of gold.
,The colour of gold. The most beautiful colour there is. Golden bananas, the monkeys might even think that they've won the jackpot too.
,Goodbye.
,Goodbye.

,长太息以掩涕兮，哀民生之多艰。
,余虽好修姱以鞿羁兮，謇朝谇而夕替。
,既替余以蕙纕兮，又申之以揽茞。
,亦余心之所善兮,虽九死其尤未悔。
,怨灵修之浩荡兮，终不察夫民心。
,众女嫉余之蛾眉兮，谣诼谓余以善淫。
,固时俗之工巧兮，偭规矩而改错。
,背绳墨以追曲兮，竞周容以为度。
,忳郁邑余佗傺兮，吾独穷困乎此时也。
,宁溘死以流亡兮，余不忍为此态也。
,鸷鸟之不群兮，自前世而固然。
,何方圜之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安？
,屈心而抑志兮，忍尤而攘诟。
,伏清白以死直兮，固前圣之所厚。
,悔相道之不察兮，延伫乎吾将反。
,回朕车以复路兮，及行迷之未远。

,It's me, my honesty's brutal
,But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
,For good at least once in a while
,So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
,Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
,But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
,Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
,I know there was a time where once I
,Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
,So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
,Appeal with the skin color of mine
,You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
,Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
,One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
,Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
,See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
,You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
,And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
,You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
,You're like normal, fuck being normal
,And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
,To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
,Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
,Singin' to a man while they played piano
,Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
,So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
,''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''

,Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
,What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
,Innovative and I'm made of rubber
,So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
,I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
,How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
,Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
,For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
,Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
,I make elevating music, you make elevator music
,Oh, he's too mainstream
,Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
,It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
,With rock, shock rap with Doc
,Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
,I don't know how to make songs like that
,I don't know what words to use
,Let me know when it occurs to you
,While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
,It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
,How many verses I gotta murder to prove
,That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
,School flunkie, pill junky
,But look at the accolades the skills brung me
,Full of myself, but still hungry
,I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
,And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
,But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
,I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
,Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
,But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
,Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
,They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
,But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
,Then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation
,And understand the discrimation
,But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
,But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
,Don't mistake it for Satan
,It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
,And take a vacation to trip a broad
,And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
,Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?

,Basement just got a frickin' overhaul,
,Got a stripper pole installed
,Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
,Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
,And go through no withdrawal
,While I get fellatio and give a facial
,To an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
,You're so appalled, so's my manager (Em)
,Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
,Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
,And nobody's close, so don't compare
,They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
,My competition can't see me
,'Cause I don't own a mirror
,But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
,I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
,Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
,Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
,But I made strides with these rape lines
,I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
,Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
,Bang, bang, bang, bang time
,Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
,You're gonna need sutures the same size
,As the blade I push into captcha
,Pull 'em like sleigh rides
,Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
,To make it on Dateline
,I came to stake my claim like a canine
,Waitin' in a buffet line
,So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
,Come play, belly dance on me
,I've been making wedding plans all day
,'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
,They want me to go eat some worms
,I hope you offended
,And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
,But I'ma make you eat your words
,I hope you offended
,You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
,'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
,I hope you offended
,'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
,'Til everybody eats my turds
,Eight year old with the wordplay
,Girl, take this pole like a survey
,Today wasn't my birthday
,But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
,So we're in shape
,'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
,I’m a ten, you’re an eight, like what I do before
,After, and during rape
,You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
,And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
,R. Kelly with a full bladder
,Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
,But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
,It's the same as I got in college (zero)
,But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
,I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
,Told you I'm so dirty,
,Homie you can throw me in some holy water
,With some floaties on
,And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me
,While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed
,You hope to God I don't explode,
,I gotta blow this spot up, though
,I got a lotta more
,I won't put the sugar coating on it though
,'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
,Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
,You feel like a wet pile of crap
,But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
,I get why you're tapped
,But you gotta get your fire back
,Catch fire, get upset and fire back
,Is what I tell myself
,When times get bad
,'Cause sometimes I might get sad
,Well I take the same advice I had
,And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
,Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
,'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
,I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
,I'm right in your ass
,'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid
,Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
,You ain't have to have no money
,Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
,Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain,
,It's rised too high to count it
,Never asked to be rich, all I did was
,Wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
,But then I think about it and I'm enraged
,'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
,For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
,It'd be minimum wage
,But it's embedded in my head
,And if I hunted for the bread and butter
,What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
,But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat
,And blood I put up in the pen
,And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
,Or forget I was ever this incredible
,I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
,Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
,To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can
,'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
,They want me to go eat some worms
,I hope you offended
,And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
,But I'ma make you eat your words
,I hope you offended
,You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
,'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
,I hope you offended
,'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
,'Til everybody eats my turds

,And it was scheduled to talk about the great things
,That we're doing with the secretary
,On the veterans administration
,And we will talk about that very much
,So in a little while

,In particular I want to thank
,Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
,With all these false laws and menacin' men
,Will fuckin' swallow you
,I'll follow you down road
,To this broken-hearted love for you
,My heart has gone as still as a corpse

,Why the fuck should I apologize?
,Country's orderless, it's a lie
,By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
,(Great people, they're great people)
,Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
,And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
,And genuine dime, I opened my mind
,Where can I find this future?
,Sever your mind and you will be blind
,And trapped in a mind that flies within our walls
,I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
,Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
,(Violence on many sides)
,The youth within our nation
,Such is a pity,
,Dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
,Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
,Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
,This has been going on for a long, long time (Why?)
,It has no place in America (Why?)
,What is vital now is a swift restoration of law (Why?)
,And order and the protection of innocent lives
,No citizen should ever fear for their safety
,And security in our society
,And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

,I don't know you but you'd probably take a bullet for me

,Might get a badge or two but after you come back
,And face the facts that half are mad and saying
,How can you look down on you
,They're taking stabs at you
,It's sad to see this afternoon these politicians after you
,When you did what you had to do
,I hear their words on the news they come unglued
,They've forgotten already overcome by their views
,But whether they believe
,That it's wrong or it's right
,I hope we never ever forget the reason you fight
,The hero in the dark with the evil in sight
,Deep in a battlefield having trouble sleeping at night
,We forget that he's a man with a daughter and wife
,We forget that evil people never call it a night
,Tell his brothers and sisters he'll be right back and he'll miss 'em
,I wave this flag as a reminder I'm still backing this system

,The people here before that shed blood for me
,To show the world that freedom isn't always free
,
,They shed a tear but can't let it go though it's been years
,Since they've seen their peers facing their deepest and darkest fears
,Staring death right in the face
,Would you ever take their place
,Would you ever stand beside them
,Or do you hide behind them
,Writing to remind them
,Some out here still find them
,Guns up in the air
,We salute in a time
,When we've forgotten what it means to have to fight for our means
,We've forgotten what the powers at be can conceive
,We've forgotten what it is we're not living in a dream
,When the truth and reality isn't what it seems
,So we make our own views based on things we've never seen
,Since we've never been to battle and we've never joined the team
,They sit the sidelines point their fingers and scream
,Since they've never had to get dirty their hands are still clean
,I believe in peace plus the freedom the bring
,I hope we can wake up stop living in a dream

,For the times that you took care of me when I was sick
,For the times that you provided, Lord knows we weren’t rich
,For the times I needed money and you helped me out
,For the times I was in trouble and you bailed me out
,I know that you’re not perfect, I know you’ve tried your best
,The reality is that we live in this giant mess
,And it’s only getting worse, I’m sure you can tell
,But you don’t even realize that you put me through hell
,And I don’t know what I’m doing, sometimes I think I’m ruined
,And I blame you, and I hate you, but I love you, It’s stupid
,Try not to be a victim, but I never had a system
,I only had myself for far back as I can vision
,I left home at 17, try not to sugar coat it
,But I wonder sometimes if my momma even noticed
,Did my family even care, were any of you there
,When I slept on the floor of that apartment and on the stairs
,Was so scared and embarrassed
,I knew that it’s apparent
,It’s clear I’ve got some issues
,And I blame my lack of parents
,You swear that it’s all in my head, I guess it’s crazy
,To refuse to be just like you, and want more than you gave me
,So hate me, call my phone to curse me out
,Dig up all my dirt, put it online and search it out
,Cut me with a knife, if it helps you sleep at night
,But I don’t want to fight, Mom I know it isn’t right
,
,Oh momma, just saying I love ya’
,Inside there’s so much pain
,Could you make it go away
,Oh momma, no one above ya’
,Pick me up when I am down
,Need you to hear me now
,Oh momma
,
,Momma I know you’re hearing this, it’s your oldest son
,If only things were different but decisions now are old and done
,I try to stay strong but I feel like I’m the only one
,Miss my family, brothers, cousins, I’m over run
,By the hurt and emotions, every holiday spent alone
,It’s atrocious how things unfolded, and now we can’t unfold it
,Feel like an orphan in this world, no way to change it
,I get hurt and turn away but it’s time to turn back and face it
,What happens when I have kids of my own
,And they wonder why it’s just mommy and daddy alone
,I don’t know how to change it yo’, I guess I only know
,That I can’t just walk away or just let it go
,And sometimes I get so lonely, And I just want back my family
,But damn it, it’s a fantasy, I’m canned in this calamity
,I’m stranded and I’m damned to be, the damage of your damage spree
,This hand that you have dealt me, isn’t helping, you can’t even see
,
,Momma, just saying I love ya’
,Inside there’s so much pain
,Could you make it go away
,Oh momma, no one above ya’
,Pick me up when I am down
,Need you to hear me now
,Oh momma
,
,Hush little baby, don’t you cry (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna sing, a lullaby (Mamma where are you)
,Momma’s gonna take, away the pain
,Momma’s gonna make, it go away ( I can’t find you)
,Hush little baby, don’t you cry (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna sing, a lullaby (Momma)
,Momma’s gonna take, away the pain
,Momma’s gonna make, it go away
,
,I know you had good intentions, this never was planned
,But sometimes you have to own the situation at hand
,The damage was done, I wish you knew how I feel
,And we can’t make it disappear but we can start to rebuild
,But you don’t even think that you did anything wrong
,You won’t even acknowledge the words to this song
,So I stay distant and I stay gone
,I wipe my tears, and just move on
,Momma

,
,
,Seems like nowadays, everybody lacks patience
,Want it right now, always sick of this waiting
,Hating on anyone, stuck in the process
,For God sakes, how long will you waste, it's non sense
,Telling you to give up on the dream, but who
,Are they to throw away, all their faith in you
,No way you're gonna fade, let them say and shoo
,Get away, 'cause what they say don't have weight with you
,You keep moving on, write that, do a song
,Right track, you belong, fight back, prove them wrong
,Yeah, just keep on, keeping on
,Yeah, 'cause this track you be on
,Right there's gotta lot of potential
,So never give up, just sharpen that pencil
,And close out all the negative talk
,Put on those old shoes and choose where you walk
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,Don't lose faith, 'cause the minute you break
,Is the minute you wake, with a million mistakes
,And a million regrets that, you'll never get back
,The time that you set back, to please other friends that
,Tell you that you can't be what you wanna be
,There's a world out there go and see what you wanna see
,I've been there, I can relate
,So let this song tell ya that it's never too late
,Wide awake, and I see more than ever
,That people are quick to give up on their endeavors
,Never really try 'cause they're scared of failure
,So, allow me to be the first to tell ya'
,I've failed more times than I've succeeded
,In the end, exactly what I needed
,To allow me to learn the right steps
,So I'd never go back, and I never regret
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,A lot of dreams get left at the wayside
,And I can feel their death in the baseline
,'Cause of something' someone once said
,At once dead,
,Won't let them stop you in your tracks, at once dead
,Say to yourself, I'ma be stronger than
,Stay up late everyday working harder than
,Keep my head focused, stick to the plan
,They say I can't but I say I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,

,
,I guess they told me, it wouldn't be easy
,It would be lonely, but only
,If I knew what would own me
,Can sew me and hold me
,Cause this game is too much for me, you know me
,I'm not the type to give up, but I'm steady slipping slowly
,Don't know where to turn, like im driving in a circle
,How do you stay running, everything is so commercial
,How do you get rid of the pain when it's so hurtful
,How do you let it go, when no one will let it go
,My past still defines me, everything is blinding
,Lights always shinning on everything behind me
,The things I don't want them to see
,I never wanted to be
,Someone who's obviously
,Struggling, juggling
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm not a perfect man, not even second close
,Music's been loving you, I probably suck at both
,I miss a date and sometimes I think I'm going crazy
,Cause I can't keep, like getting beat up
,But it doesn't faze me
,I'm cold as ice. I look around, ain't nothing nice
,They say I sew my soul, and yes infact I sewed it twice
,Threw my career into the girl of my dreams
,I weigh em both, but they still rip from the seems
,falling apart, how'd this heart get so hardened
,All in these walls have fallen
,Honestly I can acknowledge
,All this and walk with a conscience
,Cause I just tune it out, I take the foolish route
,I shut my mouth and I shout down
,You have to pull it out
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road
,It's like a rollercoaster, and it felt like what you wanted
,and there's no getting off it, even if you didn't want it
,I understand I'm just a man, your just a woman
,We can adapt and figure out a different plan
,But it's hard to deal dire issues, these hard issues
,When I feel like all of mine have become star tissues
,And they don't seem like they're healing
,Baggage back to the ceilling
,I see the pain and stealing
,I see the hurt and feeling
,And I don't know what to do about it all
,Guess I'm just out of it all
,Options about to fall, and drown it all
,You say I broke my promises and my vows, yeah
,I want to love you but I dont know how, yeah
,And now I see you looking sad and depressed
,Cause my problems became yours, and it has an effect
,And I can feel the tug of war, like it's deep in my soul
,I just need you to know, that I'm finally letting go
,I'm letting go, I'm letting go
,Of everything I've ever known
,I hope you know, I hope you know
,I'm getting myself back on that road

,过了多年我才读懂了家人的眼泪
,发现原来自己没有说再见的勇气
,离别的伤感感染了满城的空气
,失去后才知道那些有多么的珍贵
,亲爱的朋友们是否已经展翅纷飞
,不飞到高处怎么开阔自己的视野
,你已经长大了快告诉全世界
,外面的世界散发着强大的磁场
,诱惑着每一双即将展开的翅膀
,热恋的火在懵懂中凶猛的燃烧
,美丽的火花在恋人的周围环绕
,这过程很美尽管有无奈和失落
,刻骨铭心地爱过 尽管她爱的并不是我
,如果没有离别如何学会承受打击
,如果没有跌倒如何能够学会爬起
,在无尽的黑夜
,所有都快要毁灭
,至少我还有梦
,也为你而感动
,原来黎明的起点
,就在我的心里面
,只要我还有梦

沮丧 失望 如影随形 困惑 懦弱 别无选择 回答我 放逐我

不要做精神上的统治 现实中的可怜虫 不要做不忠的贤者 写下不光彩的墓碑

站起来 生活是斗争 坚强面对无知的小人

别害怕 沉默的 挣扎的 跟随我 自卑的 贪婪的 反抗的

이상해 아무리 생각해봐도
상상했던건 아니야
이렇게 서로 다른 우리가
마주보는 이 느낌은
어떻게 하나부터 열까지
같은 구석이 하나 없어
이렇게 우린 너무 다른데
싫지 않은 기분이야
나도 모르게 점점 끌려
다른 듯 같은 듯
은근히 당기는 너
아직 서롤 잘 몰라
어쩔 땐 나도 놀라
폭발하는 우리
Perfect 한 Chemistry
너와 나의 기분 좋은
언제나 함께 있으니
지루할 틈 없는 매일매일
재미있으니 나는 그걸로 됐어
또 그게 너라서 특별한 너와 나
믿겨지지 않아
설마 설마 했는데
이렇게 잘 맞아
물과 기름인줄 알았는데 너와 나
자석도 서로 다른 극이
당기는 것처럼
우리도 서로 다른 점에
끌리는 것 같아
요즘 말로 우린 환상의 케미
미친 듯이 붙어있어
like 매미 그래 재밌으니 됐잖아
매일이 벌써 기대돼 내일이
나도 모르게 점점 끌려
다른 듯 같은 듯
은근히 당기는 너
아직 서롤 잘 몰라
어쩔 땐 나도 놀라
폭발하는 우리
Perfect 한 Chemistry
너와 나의 기분 좋은
언제나 함께 있으니
지루할 틈 없는 매일 매일
재미있으니 나는 그걸로 됐어
또 그게 너라서 특별한
특별한 너와나
Perfect 한 Chemistry
너와 나의 기분 좋은
언제나 함께 있으니
지루할 틈 없는 매일 매일
재미있으니 나는 그걸로 됐어
또 그게 너라서
특별한 너와 나

,如果说你是海上的烟火
,我是浪花的泡沫
,某一刻你的光照亮了我
,如果说你是遥远的星河
,耀眼得让人想哭
,我是追逐着你的眼眸
,总在孤单时候眺望夜空
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落边拥有边失去着
,如果说你是夏夜的萤火
,孩子们为你唱歌
,那么我是想要画你的手
,你看我多么渺小一个我
,因为你有梦可做
,也许你不会为我停留
,那就让我站在你的背后
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像大雨滂沱却依然相信彩虹
,我可以跟在你身后

,To whom it may concern,
,As a student who can support myself, I am writing to request if you can help me find a potential beneficiary of Project Hope.
,I wonder whether it is convenient for you if two things regarding the child are taken into account.
,First, the child should come from Sichuan Province because I intend to help a child from my hometown.
,Second, it will be better if he or she is a primary school student who was forced to drop school because of abject poverty.
,I would like to help the，recipient of my assistance annually until he graduates from college.
,Firstly, the money will cover his tuition fee and other expenses at school.
,Besides, I will correspond with him frequently so that he can seek advice whenever he needs.
,Your prompt，attention to my inquiry would be highly appreciated.

,Dear Sir or Madam,
,As a regular library user, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you for the help you render me.
,I am writing the letter in purpose of offering some conducive recommendations to upgrade the quality of your service.
,Firstly, a great many students express their frustration with our library in that there are usually long lines waiting for assistance.
,Secondly, since computers are used by all major libraries to streamline cataloguing, we should have access to the Internet via computers.
,Lastly, I shall be much obliged to you if you could kindly replace all the outdated facilities and provide more conveniences to readers.
,I hope you will find the proposals practical.
,Your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.

,To begin with, I take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the kind assistance you render me during my stay in Canada.

,Dear Editors, I have been reading your newspaper for many years with a great enthusiasm and interest.
,It is my view that limiting the use of disposable plastic bags is of utmost significance.
,To crack this hard nut, I would like to propose several practical recommendations as follows.
,First and formost, it is imperative for us to ban the free use of disposable plastic bags.
,In addition, we should develope possible alternative forms to replace them, such as paper or clothing bags.
,Last but not least, plastic bags should be offered in a much higher price in department stores or supermarkets.
,I hope you will find the above proposals conducive and I would like to discuss this matter to further details.
,Your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express/ air dissatisfaction/ disappointment/ concern regarding accommodation. I would prefer to move into a single room next semester, as I find the present sharing arrangement inconvenient. I must explain that the reason for my dissatisfacation is my roommate's inconsiderate behavior. For one thing, his friends are constantly visiting him. For another, he regularly holds noisy parties. To solve this probem/ surmount this difficulty/ improve this situation/ crack this hard nut, I hope to draw the attention of the authorities concerned. I am sure you will agree that the only solution for me is to move into a room of my own. Therefore, I would be grateful if you could find a single room for me, preferably not in the same building but as near to the college campus as possible. Yours sincerely, Li Ming


尊敬的先生或女士： 我写信是为了表达对住宿的不满。由于我发现目前的合住很不方便，我想下学期搬到一人单间。 需要解释的是，我不满的原因是我室友不体谅的行为。首先，他的朋友经常来访。其次，他经常举办一些吵闹的聚会。 我希望引起有关部门的注意，以解决这一问题。相信您也会认同唯一的解决措施就是搬到一个属于我一个人的房间。因此，如果您可以为我找一个不在同楼，但离校园越近越好的单间，我将非常感谢。 您真诚的， 李明

Dear Xiaoqiang, I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude. I am referring to that unfortunate accident the other day, when I was knocked off my bike by a taxi. If it had not been for your timely assistance in giving me first aid, I fear that the consequences might have been much more serious. Everyone agrees that it was your quick-witted response in that emergency that has led to this satisfactory outcome. Although nowadays people in mounting numbers talk about the need to be unselfish, we see very few people practice what they preach. If there were more people like you, this world would be a much nicer place. Yours sincerely, Li Ming


亲爱的小强： 我写信是为了表达我衷心的感谢。我指的是那天我被一辆出租车从自行车上撞下来的不幸事件。 如果没有您及时为我急救，恐怕后果会更严重。大家都认为正是您在那个紧要关头的快速反应带来了令人满意的结果。 尽管现在越来越多的人谈论到大公无私的必要性，但是很少看到有人言行一致。如果有更多人像您一样，世界会更加美好。 您真诚的， 李明

Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you to recommend one of my best friends, Zhou Botong, for this post. With his outstanding leadership and cheerful personality, he was elected chairperson of the Student Union of Fudan University several times.

My dear Jack, I feel most embarrassed in referring to a rather difficult subject. I wonder if it may have slipped your memory that nearly three months ago you asked me for a loan of RMB 500. You said you woud make repayment on the next pay day. Perhaps you may make the repayment within 2 weeks. I am sure you will agree and not be offended at my request. Here is a good news for you.

亲爱的杰克： 有件麻烦事，我颇感不安。恐怕你也许忘记了三个月前向我借了500元钱。你曾许诺领到工资就归还。再有两周时间，你能还这笔钱吧。相信你会同意，不至于因我的要求而见怪。 同时告诉你一个好消息，正在北京访问的俄罗斯国家芭蕾舞团将于明晚再国家大剧院演出精彩节目，我想你会乐意观看。我给你留下一张入场券。演出7点整开始，我在剧院入口处等你。如果你来不了，请告诉我一声。 你真诚的， 李明
As is shown in the bar chart, the total production of tobacco in the world shrank from 14.364 billion pounds in 1994 to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. According to the figures given in the pie chart, tobacco consumers account for 20% of the world population. This causes great harm to us. Financially, it results in a yearly loss of 200 billion US dollars spent on cigarettes. Physically, about 3 million people on the globe die from smoking-related diseases every year. Faced with such a threat, people from all walks of life have tried various measures for a total tobacco ban. For one thing, health experts try hard to warn the public of the dangers involved. For another, the authorities have passed laws to limit tobacco production and consumption, raised tobacco taxes and prohibited smoking in public places. More importantly, the public launch campaigns to cut smoking. On the basis of the analyses above, we can predict the future tendency confidently. With the further growth in economy and more changes in life style, the tendency of tobacco consumption indicated in the table will definitely decrease in the years to come.


如柱状图所示，世界烟草总产量从1994年的143.64亿磅减少到了1995年的142亿磅。根据饼状图，吸烟人口占世界人口的20%。这给我们带来了严重的危害。经济上，每年由于吸烟损失2000亿美元。身体上，每年全球大约300万人死于与吸烟相关的疾病。 面对这种威胁，各行各业的人已经竭尽所能来全面禁烟。一方面，健康专家试图警告公众与吸烟相关的危害。另一方面，政府立法限制烟草的生产和消费，提高烟税，并且禁止在公共场所吸烟。更为重要的是，公众展开了禁烟运动。 在上述分析的基础上，我们可以充满信心地预测未来的趋势。随着经济的不断发展和生活方式的进一步改变，图表中所示的烟草消费趋势将来肯定会下降。
According to the cartoon, various kinds of promises are often seen in advertisements, department stores and even public services. Even a hen has learned how to promise. It is clear that the hen is deliberately mystifying those who are interested in the eggs she lays. In our society, many enterprises try to fool consumers in much the same way that the hen does. In the first place, shop-owners and company managers in mounting numbers make use of promises and attempt to induce consumers to purchase their goods or services. In the second place, battles of false promise-making become increasingly severe in the commercial welfare, causing great harm to the society. As far as I am concerned, all we should lay more emphasis on is what we do and how we can virtually improve the level of service. As the old saying goes, "Good wine needs no bush." Only in this way can we make people satisfied with what we do.


漫画显示，各式各样的承诺经常出现在广告、商店甚至公众服务中间。以致一只母鸡也学会了如何承诺。很明显，这只鸡正在有意迷惑那些对它所产的鸡蛋感兴趣的人们。 在我们的社会中，很多企业也跟这只鸡一样以同样的方式试图欺骗消费者。首先，越来越多的店主和公司经理们试图利用承诺引诱消费者购买其产品或服务。其次，虚假承诺的战役在商业福利中日趋激烈，给社会带来严重危害。 在我看来，我们所应重视的是做什么和如何真正提高服务水平。正如言语所说:“酒香不怕巷子深”， 只有这样才能使人们对我们的行为满意。
As is shown by the two graphs, the U.S. population soared from 2 million to 250 million from 1800 to 1990. In contrast, the number of wildlife species no longer existing shot up, adding up to 70 over the same period of time. It is obvious that the extinction of wildlife resulted from the population explosion. We may cite a variety of reasons for this situation. First of all, the destruction of ecological balance plays a pushing role. Due to population problems, pollution and desertification are becomeing increasingly serious. Furthermore, a great number of species were killed for food, for money and even for fun. Even worse, with the rapid growth of human population, inhabitable areas were expanding so fast that few areas were left for wild animals. To sum up, it is imperative for us to take effective measures to protect wildlife. Firstly, the U.S. government should pour more investment into wildlife protection in a bid to create a better environment. Secondly, the birth rate in the U.S. must be put under control as the dramatically expanding population gives rise to serious environmental problems.


如图所示，从1800年到1990年，美国人口从200万猛增到2.5亿。与此相反，灭绝的野生物钟数也直线上升，在同期增加到70种。显而易见，野生动物的灭绝源于人口剧增。 我们可以引用很多原因解释此现象。首先，生态平衡的破坏发挥了主导作用。由于人口问题，污染和沙漠化日渐严重。其次，很多物种由于捕食、盈利甚至娱乐而被猎杀。更糟糕的是，由于人口急剧增长，人类居住地扩张如此迅速，以至于野生动物无家可归。 总而言之，我们很有必要采取有效措施保护野生动物。首先，美国政府应向野生动物保护投入更多资金以便改善环境。其次，由于人口激增导致了严重的环境问题，美国人口出生率必须得到控制。
As is shown in the pictures, with the rampancy of commercial fishing, the number of fish has dramatically shrunk. In the first picture, we learn that the year 1900 witnessed a quite encouraging scene of world fishing. There were various kinds of fish and only one fishing-boat. On the contrary, in the second picture, in 1995 there was only one fish swimming freely but many fishing-boats sailing in the sea. It is apparent that a disastrous change has occurred. The purpose of the pictures is to tell us that due attention has to be paid to the reducation of ocean resources. Owing to the over-exploitation of marine resources, the numner of fish has declined at an accelerating rate. If we let this situation continue as it is, we do not know where the fish will be in the future. By that time, our environment will suffer a great destruction. Hence, it is imperative for us to take drastic measures to reverse this disturbing trend illustrated in the above pictures. For one thing, we should appeal to the authorities to make strict laws to control commercial fishing. For another, we should cultivate the awareness of people that ocean resources are of great significance to us. Only in this way can we protect our natural environment. I believe that we humans can surmount this difficulty and we will have a brilliant future.


如图所示，随着商业捕鱼的泛滥，鱼的数量已经显著下降。在第一幅图中，我们可以看到在1900年，世界捕鱼业是鼓舞人心的，画面上有很多鱼，但只有一艘渔船。而在第二幅图中，在1995年，只有一条鱼在游动，但有许多渔船在海上航行。显而易见，灾难性的变化已经发生。 这组图的目的是告诉我们应该对海洋资源的减少给予充分重视。由于海洋资源的过度开发，鱼的数量已经明显下降。如果听任这种情况发展，我们不知道鱼的未来在哪儿。到那时，我们的环境将会遭受巨大的破坏。 因此，我们急需采取严厉措施扭转图画中所示的令人困扰的趋势。一方面，我们应该呼吁各级政府制定严格的法律来控制商业捕鱼。另一方面，我们应该增强人们的意识：海洋资源对我们非常重要。只有这样才能保护我们的海洋资源。同时，我相信人类能够克服这个困难，并将拥有美好的未来。
The symbolic implication conveyed in the cartoon is that love is most desired where one is in difficulty. Among all the notable emotions of human race, the most sublime is love. As the picture depicts, love is just like a smiling lamp whose rays become brighter where it is darker. A case in point is the Project Hope. In many poverty-stricken areas in China, few children can afford to go to school owing to lack of financial support. Therefore, the Project Hope is initiated to help them get out of difficulty and continue their schooling. Let's take another example. The year 1998 witnessed a disastrous flood in China. At that time, people all over the country were united as one and donate whatever they could. Be it money or goods. A large number of donations were raised and sent to the severely affected areas, which helped the victims to relieve their difficult situation. Whenever one gets in trouble, it is our duty to lend a helping hand to him or her. As John F. Kennedy put it," Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Only in this way can each corner of our society be lit up by love.


漫画中所显示的象征意义是：人在陷入困境时，最需要爱。在所有有价值的人类感情中，爱是最崇高的。如图所示，爱心像一盏灯，在越黑暗的地方越明亮。 一个明显的例子就是希望工程。在中国的很多贫困地区，由于缺乏经济支持，很少有孩子能去上学。因此，人们发起希望工程来帮助他们走出困境继续学业。让我们再看一个例子。1998年中国发生了一场特大洪水。那时，全国人民团结一致，慷慨解囊，募集了大笔资金和物资并送往重灾区，减轻了灾民的困难。 无论何时有人陷入困境，我们都有义务伸出援助之手。正如约翰.肯尼迪所说：“不要问你的国家能为你做什么，要问你能为你的国家做什么。”只有这样，我们社会的每个角落才能充满爱。
The picture vividly depicts an American girl, wearing a traditional Chinese costume of a certain minority group, is smiling heartedly. She is wearing a long pair of ear rings and a necklace with a pearl tassel. Her hat is cute and trimmed with lace. The clothes add oriental charm to her beautiful appearance. In my opinion, what the picture conveys is far beyond a new fashion trend and carries cultural implications as well. It is clear that a unique culture can be accepted by the international society when its distinctive features are fully expressed. In fact, national cultures have no boundary and may be appreciated and shared by people from other cultral backgrounds. Admittedly, as the reflection of the outlook of the people, national cultural as priceless spiritual treasure ought to be preserved and cherished. At the same time, there are positive reasons to advocate international culture. While global economic integration has fostered thorough cultural interchanges, it is multiculturalism that essentially makes the society and its people diverse, colorful, vigorous and open-minded. Generally speaking, to be international is undisputedly the best choice if a nation wishes to adopt an open-minded way of progressing.


这幅图画生动地描述了一位美国姑娘穿着中国某个少数民族的传统服装，正在开心地微笑。她戴着一副长耳环和一条带着珍珠流苏的项链。她的帽子很可爱，还有花边修饰。这套衣服为她美丽的外表增添了东方魅力。 在我看来，这幅图画所显示的远不只是一种时尚潮流，还具有文化内涵。显而易见，当一种独特文化的特征被充分表现时，它就能被国际社会所接受。实际上，民族文化没有界限，可以被来自不同文化背景的人们所欣赏和分享。毫无疑问，作为对人们世界观的反映，作为物价的精神财富，民族文化应该被保存和珍惜。同时，我们有充分的理由发展世界文化。在全球经济一体化促进彻底的文化交流的同时，正是多元文化使社会与人民丰富多元、五彩缤纷、充满活力并思想开放。总而言之，如果一个国家想采取一种开放的进步方式，毋庸置疑，国际化是最佳选择。
As is vividly depicted in the first cartoon, the tender flower blossoms inside the greenhouse in spite of the gusty wind, driving rain and terrifying lightning. Unfortunately, as soon as it is exposed to the thunderstorm, it soon fades and withers, with its delicate petals washed away. The fact that flowers growing in the greenhouse cannot withstand the test of the storm indicates that too much comfort spoils the child. As the only child excessively cared by the parents, young people are often associated with the flowers. The greenhouse epitomizes parents' doting care which shelter the children from the thunderstorm, in other words, the competitive world. The greenhouse flower is too weak to survive in the wild, where weeds always flourish. In the same way, once young people met with some setbacks, they will feel frustrated and thus lose heart inevitably, which may well lead to tragedy of some kind. Only when a person experiences all sorts of trials and sufferings can he or she survive the blows of storms or misfortunes, and eventually establish himself firmly in the society. As the old saying goes, "Adversity leads to prosperity." Let's get out of the "greenhouse" to see the fascinating world, to mix up with people and get prepared for the fierce competition ahead.


如第一幅图所示，尽管狂风大作、暴雨倾盆、雷电交加，温室中娇弱的花朵仍然在绽放。不幸的是，当暴雨在雷雨之下后，它迅速凋零，花瓣散落一地。 温室里的花朵经不起风雨这一事实说明过于舒适的环境会宠坏孩子。由于父母过度关怀独生子女，人们经常把年轻人和花朵联系起来。温室是保护孩子免收诶与侵害的父母溺爱的缩影。雷雨换句话说就是充满竞争的世界。温室里的花朵太柔弱，无法在杂草丛生的野外生存下去。同样，一旦年轻人面临挫折，他们将感到沮丧，并不可避免的失去信心，这将导致某种悲剧。 只有当一个人经历了各种磨练和痛苦，才能经受风雨或不幸的打击，并最终在社会上文件立足。如谚语所说：“逆境迎向昌盛。”让我们走出温室去经历迷人的世界，与人们融洽相处，并为未来的激烈竞争做好准备。
The drawing vividly shows a runner who is making a spurt at the finishing line which is also a new point he will start from. In the drawing, the runner is running with painstaking effort around the track of a playground, sweat pouring down his face. On both sides of the runner, there are two poles and a line between them. On the ground there are two signs that say "ENDING" and "STARTING". The painter wants to tell us that, just like running, whatever we are doing, we should never stop making progress. First and formost, it applies to individuals as in such a competitive world everybody is trying to get ahead. Furthermore, the country on the world should move forward in terms of politics, economy, and culture so that we Chinese as a nation can gain sustained repect from other peoples. Examples to prove the view are abundant. The most persuasive are the cases of famous athletes like Fu Mingxia and Deng Yaping, whose success is gained through non-stop efforts. By contrast, a lot of people choose to take a rest to enjoy their small success and thus lose the motivation for further achievement. In sum, keeping making progress should be the right attitude towards life and work for everybody and even for a country.


这幅画生动地描绘了一个跑步者正在冲向终点，这个终点同时也是一个新的起点。在图画中，他正付出艰苦的努力，绕着操场的跑道奔跑，汗水淌下脸庞。在他的两边，有两个标杆，标杆间有一条线。地面上有两个标记，写着“终点”和“起点”。 画家想传达给我们的是，正如跑步一样，无论我们做什么，都不应停止前进。首先，它适用于个人。因为在这样一个充满竞争的世界里，每个人都在努力向前。其次，整个国家在政治、经济和文化方面也应该不断前进，这样中国菜能赢得各国人民的长久尊敬。 能证明这个观点的例子不胜枚举。最有说服力的就是诸如伏明霞和邓亚萍等著名运动员的例子。她们的成功正是通过永不停息的努力获得的。总之，不断取得进步应是每个人甚至国家对于生活和工作的正确态度。
As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, four children are playing a "football match" of taking care of their aged father. Each of them stands in a different corner of a football field. The eldest son kicked out the father with the other three children guarding their goals. The purpose of the drawing is to show us that due attention has be paid to the mistreatment of senior citizens. First and foremost, some people shirk their duty of financially supporting their old and helpless parents due to their own interests. Furthermore, some elderly peolple are often ill-treated by their own children and cannot lead a normal life. Last but not least, while some young people enjoy a comfortable life, their parents are neglected and reduced to utter poverty. It is imperative for us to take drastic measures. To begin with, relevant laws and regulations should be made to severely punish those who shun the responsibilties of caring for their parents. In addition, we should cultivate the awareness of the young that respecting the old has always been the traditional virtue of Chinese cultral. Only in this way can we curb the current evil phenomenon revealed in the picture.


图片生动地展示了四个子女正在进行一场养老“足球赛”。他们每个人站在足球场的一角。大儿子将父亲踢出，而其他三个子女则守住自己的球门。 这副图画的目的是告诉我们应该对老年人受虐待的问题给予高度重视。首先，有些人出于个人利益，逃避赡养年迈无助的双亲的责任。其次，有些老年人受尽子女的虐待，无法过上正常的生活。最后，在年轻人享受安逸生活的同时，他们的父母受尽冷落，一贫如洗。 我们迫切需要采取严厉的措施。一方面，我们应该制定相关的法规严惩那些逃避养老责任的子女。另一方面，我们应当培养年轻人的意识：尊敬老人是中国文化的传统美德。只有这样我们才能遏制图片中所揭露的当前存在的丑恶现象。
The two photos show that people are enthusiastic about football stars such as the English football player Beckham. Some like the young man in the photo express their enthusiasm by writing his name on their faces, while others, like the one in the hair studio, spend as much as 300 yuan for a hairstyle modeling on that of Beckham. In fact, that kind of star-worshipping is not uncommon nowadays among the Chinese people. For example, the so-called "Super Girls" became fashionable almost overnight, with fans chasing after them in a kind of blind worship. It seems as is people are badly in need of someone to whom to pay their respect and to realize their own aspirations of an immediate success or stardom. Famous football players won our favor and earned our respect by their hardwork and excellent performance on the football field. What, then, deserves to be worshipped, their diligence and perseverance, or their hairstyle and ways of living? The answer seems self-evident: what we should learn is their spirit, not the superficial styles of living. Fashion is often short-lived, but the ever-lasting memory of a courageous, undaunted and skillful football player is what inspires us in our pursuit for better life and brighter future.


这两张照片反映了人们对于像英国足球明星贝克汉姆这样的足星非常狂热。有些人像图片中的年轻人一样，通过在脸上写贝克汉姆的名字来表达他们的狂热；而另一些人则像理发店中的年轻人一样，花300元做个“小贝头”。 事实上，在当今中国人中，这种明星崇拜并不少见。例如，所谓的“超级女生”大赛几乎一夜成名，而粉丝们则以一种盲目的崇拜来追逐他们。似乎人们迫切需要向某些人表达自己的敬意，同时满足自己马上成功或成为明星的渴望。 著名的足球明星们通过自己在足球场上的艰苦努力和卓越表现，赢得了我们的喜爱和尊敬。那么，究竟是什么值得我们崇拜呢？是他们的勤奋与坚定，还是他们的发型和生活方式？答案似乎不言自明：我们应该学习的是他们的精神，而不是表面的生活方式。时尚总是昙花一现，而对于一个勇敢无畏、技艺精湛的足球明星的永恒记忆，才能激励我们追求更好的生活和光辉的未来。

,Төгілді ұғын жас орнына,
,Махаббат шынайы арман ғана.
,Жалғыздық сыйлады пана маған,
,Мен бір аңсаған,бас ұрған пенде ғана,пенде ғана.
,Құшақтаймын,бірақ сүйе алмаймын сені.
,Қаншама тырыссамда көне алмайды жүрек,
,Мен сүйем оны,ол менің жүрегімді жаулаған.
,Кешірші жаным оны қалайша ұмыта алам,
,Сен маған ұнайсың,сен керемесің.
,Атына заты сай нағыз ару бойжеткенсің,
,Жаман ойларың жоқ білемін адалымсың.
,Бірақ сені сүйе алмаймын жағдайым сол,
,Ол мені сүймейді,бағаламағанда.
,Өтірік күлімсіреп,ол мені талай алдағанба,
,Алысқа кетсем күтпейтін хатта жазбайтын.
,Сонда да оны сүйем неге түсіне алмай тұрм,
,Ол соңында таңдады басқаны ағындағы.
,Оныңда жүрегін бір күні білем сындырады,
,Оған керегі тек сенің аяу хатың.
,Таусылғанда кетер өзгеге болып қатын,
,Мен таңданамын неге сені сүйе алмаймын.
,Неге түп-түзу қазақ қызын құшағын жайған,
,Өтінем сенен құтқаршы періні ұмытуға.
,Маған керек қазақ қызы сендей сұлу!

,Ұнатып бара жатырым-ау мен,
,Көз алдымда сенің бейнең сағым болды.
,Мен дәмін таттым махаббаттың,
,Жүрегімді жылатып,жұбатып.

歌词大意
多少个深夜你哄我入睡，
把孩子当成了你的全部
为我受尽苦的母亲，
如今你还好吗？
童年一去不复返，
而我只能望月寻思念。
是你从小引导我前行，
给我你温暖的怀抱。
多少个岁月，你伟大的身躯扛起了所有的苦。
让我在阳光之下成长。
在儿的心里，是你给了我全部。
慈祥的母亲，谁会比你更伟大？

,
,每一个人都在挣扎
,
,每一个人都有
,想去的地方
,
,有时候天使不回答
,
,也许只是因为
,心还不够渴望
,我擦干泪水
,再一次出发
,我在漫漫长夜之中飞翔
,寻找属于我的那道星光
,明明知道诚实容易受伤
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,我要奔向我心里的远方
,亲手拥抱最美好的时光
,路上难免也会迷失方向
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,拥有梦的人
,世界多么疯狂
,
,都不害怕 我不害怕
,
,想在你面前放光芒
,
,想看见你为我
,骄傲的模样
,
,我只有一分钟悲伤
,
,然后微笑
,就把挫折都遗忘
,一定有幸福 在我的前方
,我在漫漫长夜之中飞翔
,寻找属于我的那道星光
,明明知道诚实容易受伤
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,我要奔向我心里的远方
,亲手拥抱最美好的时光
,路上难免也会迷失方向
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,拥有梦的人
,世界多么疯狂
,都不害怕
,一闪一闪 星星亮了
,一闪一闪 给我希望
,不知不觉 我热泪盈眶
,
,我在漫漫长夜之中飞翔
,寻找属于我的那道星光
,明明知道诚实容易受伤
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,我要奔向我心里的远方
,亲手拥抱最美好的时光
,路上难免也会迷失方向
,我不害怕 我不害怕
,抬起头来泪就不会落下
,扬起嘴角我就不再徬徨
,跟着心里最想要的愿望
,越过高山 越过海洋
,我愿相信生命就要天亮
,我愿相信痛苦里有宝藏
,有个明天正在等我抵达
,我在路上 正在路上
,拥有梦的人 路有多长
,都不害怕 我不害怕
,口中是之乎者也腿上我摊本题典
,老班曾告诫我们意识超前
,文科我权当消遣小科它只是甜点
,学好那数理化生才是正解
,从古至今考生最悲催
,回首往事泪流满面
,少年少女拿着重难点
,都是为了六月那天
,三角正弦余切小球受力加叠
,药品沉淀溶解细胞有丝分裂
,对面成功彼岸有谁能看的见
,只有奋发图强刻苦去专研
,直线平行异面物块碰撞形变
,分子反应断键豌豆黄粒圆脸
,书山题海之中我抬头望着天
,叹那大学门啊何时能相见
,台上他讲话连篇台下咱把题来解
,我们呐没有时间可以停歇
,无视那科学实验不管他社会实践
,一定要仔细斟酌A B C D
,壮兮美哉天朝理科生
,久经沙场意志弥坚
,五三龙门和新干线
,不留空白全部消灭
,三角正弦余切小球受力加叠
,药品沉淀溶解细胞有丝分裂
,我们出身卑微没有后路可选
,只能一心向学蟾宫来折桂
,直线平行异面物块碰撞形变

,两点一线之间我大步走向前

寂寞夜里屏住呼吸
想你想到没有力气
不想再让自己压抑
享受被爱的权力

我们的爱已产生物理效应
无法再回去

今后的我不知会变怎样
是好是坏不能胡乱猜想
越想得到越难握住手掌
还是脚踏实地稳扎稳打

,While love shines bright
,Can't let you go we're meant forever baby let me know

,惨痛的地步造就 反动的艺术
,集聚路程 留下感动的记录
,惨痛的义务 悲情的舞蹈
,脱离管用的庇护 转动的闭路
,让我再次想把窗帘给拉上
,怎么就能这样辜负当年的搭档
,万一宣告对抗曾经窗前的霸王
,上帝没有兑现提供光源的发放 我发亮
,像夸父追逐着光芒
,吹拂着真相击败 归途的荒凉
,经济发展带来慌忙
,行为的猖狂 暴露内心的荒唐
,孤傲不要变大
,粗暴胡闹变化枯燥变成毒药咽下
,当你灵魂能够彻底除掉现价
,这一切都不被践踏
,眼下站在生死存亡的边界
,洒酒看待身边牺牲的先烈
,放眼望去难以到达的天界
,无法抗拒人类无情的宣泄
,等待上天的指导
,因为制造的没有实效
,事实已经迟到
,直到每个人的心中都想傲慢
,直到最后的暴乱

行走在悠长的隧道没人给到指引
在有光的地方书写着坚强造笔
光线的照射就像沉在海里的潜艇
黑暗遮挡了光线下起了狂风暴雨
幸运的能够顺着风吹 忘了后觉得那些连根疲惫
每一天的目的对得起自己的劳累
招架不住的欲望都变得所失惭愧
有光的地方总有火苗 会炙热会照射
光的暗无往处都浇灭了快乐 磨灭不了的麦克
了解不到的透彻 眼前的状态已经够了 
世界的五颜六色容易分辨 
黑暗的果实难以吞咽
光给人的兴奋挡住了抵抗不再使人郁闷
得到了体谅一直超前不再记恨
看透了虚假信息白天给我正能量
好事都在近期做事只走正门
故事被欲望填满 笔画书写的简短
当大门打开累的消耗殆尽 
傻逼们光说不做的思想焦躁太定
再也不做考虑是谁去想的主意
三番五次的努力和不敢面对的勇气
保持精力充沛过生活 忘记那些表面看得太单薄

我不是太慌张 忘记受过的伤
手里想抓住光 却迷失了方向

依旧在人来人往之中穿行一直寻找着黑暗中的光明 
不是对周围事物漠不关心而是有些事情 祸不单行 
虽然身处黑暗但从不慌张 
这个圈子就好像一个方框 
先把你铐住再把你锁上 
没了光的话是否还能处置妥当 
所以别再怪我心狠 
我的世界是如此的冰冷 
又是从何处听闻的flow变的精准 
有时候我 
也想闭眼对你亲吻 
可是他们并不相信 我的死期将近 
不需要相信当我死后头上会有一道光晕 
但愿这个世界没有了所有黑暗没有伤病 
多么荒唐 我到底在哪 
来日方长 那些故事太假 
没有任何路标的哪里才是方向 
只有爬到了树梢 才能看见光亮 
每当被 噩梦缠身 我都会 一路狂奔 
习惯每天都是从清晨 睡到了黄昏 
阴暗下水道的身体早已溃烂 
钢筋水泥中寻找真理好比罪犯 
确实我也想试着向你解释 
也是凌晨拿起笔继续写字 
看着一切都在发生我没法阻止 
周围一片黑暗伸手看不见五指 
随着尘埃落定 时间永远不会停止 
偶尔或远或近 谁会记得我的名字

我不是太惆怅 忘记受过的伤
手里想抓住光 却迷失了方向

冬日雪茫茫 大地换上白衣裳
太阳底下泛起片片金色光芒
那是老师经常念叨的发射光
反射的光 让我看到世界的漂亮
我的理想也在那个方向
眼睛的方向
看到的都是反射的光
也是理想的方向
冬日雪茫茫 大地换上白衣裳
太阳底下泛起片片金色光芒
那是老师经常念叨的发射光
反射的光 让我看到世界的漂亮
我的理想也在那个方向
眼睛的方向
看到的都是反射的光
也是理想的方向
冬日雪茫茫 大地换上白衣裳
太阳底下泛起片片金色光芒

vers1：
没有所谓的新鲜感
但是多看一眼我我们都会烦
我们出笼就像猛兽一般
而你说了太多我都不会理睬
在网络上发情嘶吼肆意妄为就像野狗
你说什么我听不见你再说一遍
当我发现自己错
都是男孩闯的祸
别再说这个冬天你想和我过
可我心里打着鼓
被鼓弄的想法就像是被下了蛊
鼓励着自己把这瓶喝下肚
下蛊的巫师在跳着舞
honey你说想当darling
但我不搭理
因为我没money
固执和偏执犹如孩童宣誓
我到底应该要去哪里
在那里在这里在哪里才能找回当初那个天真可爱的你
但是我不可以不允许不愿意自己这样随意的去改变了你
一个人躺在沙发上
握在手里的可乐在晃
看外面正在下着暴雨
不是我想要下雨
vers2：
这一次我决定放手不回头
忘掉烦恼和伤痛踏步先走
那些搞不定的让你拼了命的人是否还要在去祈求
那个扫到一旁已经跑出回忆的是谁送给你的气球
回不到的从前也许末日降至
丧失理智像懦弱僵尸
开始去习惯没有你的生活
枷锁和束缚就在此刻挣脱
也许是那天玩笑开的过火
冒昧的承认了自己的过错
那天你说的事我已经忘了
冬天夜里被抽出后无限放大
徘徊等待的行人在哪边
不爱撑伞也从不畏惧暴雨天

,在这普通的一天
,我翻开量子力学
,很普通地翻到那散射理论
,一会儿是弹性散射
,一会儿非弹性散射
,它们都可以使用分波理论
,有时是库仑散射
,有时带自旋散射
,用了这分波法都可轻松解决
,无穷远的波函数
,趋于零的波函数
,其他的部分我们要用近似
,啊啊啊啊~
,普通的玻恩近似普通推导
,其他近似老师讲了还是不懂
,那普通的学霸在普通的偷笑
,在普通的左矢右矢中普通的抓狂
,普通的量子力学看不懂哟
,那普通的学霸在普通的偷笑（23333）
,这普通的波函数是不是定态
,在定态的薛定谔方程中普通解掉
,普通的玻恩近似普通推导

,在一个晚上我的母亲问我
,今天怎么不开心
,我说在我的想象中有一双滑板鞋
,与众不同最时尚跳舞肯定棒
,整个城市找遍所有的街都没有
,她说将来会找到的时间会给我答案
,星期天我再次寻找依然没有发现
,一个月后我去了第二个城市
,这里的人们称它为魅力之都
,时间过的很快夜幕就要降临
,我想我必须要离开
,当我正要走时我看到了一家专卖店
,那就是我要的滑板鞋
,我的滑板鞋时尚时尚最时尚
,回家的路上我情不自禁
,摩擦  摩擦
,在这光滑的地上摩擦
,月光下我看到自己的身影有时很远有时很近
,感到一种力量驱使我的脚步
,有了滑板鞋天黑都不怕
,一步两步一步两步 一步一步似爪牙
,似魔鬼的步伐
,摩擦 摩擦
,我给自己打着节拍
,这是我生命中美好的时刻
,我要完成我最喜欢的舞蹈
,在这美丽的月光下在这美丽的街道上
,我告诉自己这是真的这不是梦
,一步两步一步两步 一步一步似爪牙

,If you've been just staring at the sunrise above this hollow town
,been chasing empty memories, the kind that's keeping you down
,can't seem to find your strife, just trying to live your life
,been feeling suffocated, searching for vindication
,
,this sense of indecision ain't what we had in mind
,the dream that I envisioned, I am still hoping to find
,you ain't done nothing wrong but we ain't done nothing right
,I know that something's missing
,
,but the world will keep on turning turning
,you gotta keep that fire burning burning
,I know you think you're in a hurry
,there's no need to worry
,cause I can feel it turning turning
,our luck is turning around
,
,chasing these empty verses, some rows have crooked signs
,we're losing all this daylight but soon the moon's gonna rise
,these final puzzle pieces, we tried but they're too tight
,but if we ease the pressure, I bet they'll fit just right
,
,sometimes it takes some patience, sometimes it works first try
,but I know that this is worth it, cause this dream's too strong to die
,I ain't done nothing wrong but we ain't done nothing right
,one day we'll find what's missing

,I've been low, beaten down
,I've been lost now I'm found
,this fire is burning us
,still staring at the sunrise, missing that hollow town
,feeling those empty memories but nothing's holding me down
,I hope you find your strife, just go and live your life
,I'm feeling vindicated
,the world will keep on turning turning
,you better keep that fire burning burning
,I know you think you're in a hurry

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,This jealousy will break the whole
,And I rolled away
,Said we never wanted much
,Just a rollercoaster
,Our love has never konwn the way
,Sugar for the pill
,You know it's just the way things are
,Cannot buy the sun
,This jealousy will break the whole
,
,The wave of your voice
,Sounds beautiful to me, each time
,The wave of your lingered words
,Got me crying
,And so, I hum too
,Everyday I would listen to you
,Take me to your warm hug
,And when I go blank suddenly
,Your waving voice could lighten me
,The wave of your smile and laugh
,Looks so beautiful to me, each day
,The wave of the way you talk
,Makes the breeze come
,So I could smile again
,Leaving all lies that near come to me
,Keeping me safe and comfy
,I could left all of my stress to you
,And that’s what you are to me

,Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter
,Cause all my life, I've been fighting
,Never felt a feeling of comfort
,All this time, I've been hiding
,And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
,I'm so used to sharing
,Love only left me alone
,But I'm at one with the silence
,
,I found peace in your violence
,Can’t show me there’s  no point in trying
,I'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long
,I found peace in your violence

,
,I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
,My whole life, I've felt like a burden
,I think too much, and I hate it
,I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
,Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence
,
,I found peace in your violence
,Can’t show me there’s  no point in trying

,古之学者必有师。

,欲人之无惑也难矣！
,古之圣人， 其出人也远矣，
,犹且从师而问焉；
,今之众人，
,其下圣人也亦远矣，
,而耻学于师。
,是故圣益圣， 愚益愚。
,圣人之所以为圣，
,愚人之所以为愚，
,其皆出于此乎？
,爱其子， 择师而教之；
,于其身也， 则耻师焉， 惑矣。
,彼童子之师，
,授之书而习其句读者，
,非吾所谓传其道解其惑者也。
,句读之不知， 惑之不解，
,或师焉， 或不焉，
,小学而大遗， 吾未见其明也。
,巫医乐师百工之人， 不耻相师。
,士大夫之族， 曰师曰弟子云者，
,则群聚而笑之。 问之， 则曰：
,“彼与彼年相若也， 道相似也。
,位卑则足羞， 官盛则近谀。”
,呜呼！ 师道之不复可知矣。

,孔子师郯子、 苌弘、 师襄、 老聃。
,郯子之徒， 其贤不及孔子。

,闻道有先后， 术业有专攻，
,如是而已。

,进不入以离尤兮，退将复修吾初服。
,制芰荷以为衣兮，集芙蓉以为裳。
,不吾知其亦已兮，苟余情其信芳。
,高余冠之岌岌兮，长余佩之陆离。
,芳与泽其杂糅兮，唯昭质其犹未亏。
,忽反顾以游目兮，将往观乎四荒。
,佩缤纷其繁饰兮，芳菲菲其弥章。
,民生各有所乐兮，余独好修以为常。
,虽体解吾犹未变兮，岂余心之可惩。
,忳郁邑余佗傺兮，吾独穷困乎此时也。
,宁溘死以流亡兮，余不忍为此态也。
,鸷鸟之不群兮，自前世而固然。
,何方圜之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安？
,屈心而抑志兮，忍尤而攘诟。
,伏清白以死直兮，固前圣之所厚。
,悔相道之不察兮，延伫乎吾将反。
,回朕车以复路兮，及行迷之未远。

,蜀道之难，难于上青天！
,蚕丛及鱼凫
,哎呦，你还不会啊，我都会唱了
,噫吁嚱，危乎高哉！
,蜀道之难，难于上青天！
,蚕丛及鱼凫，开国何茫然。
,尔来四万八千岁，不与秦塞通人烟。
,西当太白有鸟道，可以横绝峨眉颠。
,地崩山摧壮士死，然后天梯石栈相钩连。
,上有六龙回日之高标，下有冲波逆折之回川。
,黄鹤之飞尚不得过，猿猱欲度愁攀援。
,青泥何盘盘，
,百步九折萦岩峦。
,扪参历井仰胁息，以手抚膺坐长叹。
,问君西游何时还？畏途巉岩不可攀。
,但见悲鸟号古木，雄飞雌从绕林间。
,又闻子规啼夜月，愁空山。
,蜀道之难，难于上青天，使人听此凋朱颜。
,连峰去天不盈尺，枯松倒挂倚绝壁。
,飞湍瀑流争喧豗，砯崖转石万壑雷。
,其险也如此，嗟尔远道之人胡为乎来哉！
,剑阁峥嵘而崔嵬，一夫当关，万夫莫开。
,所守或匪亲，化为狼与豺。
,朝避猛虎，夕避长蛇；磨牙吮血，杀人如麻。
,锦城虽云乐，不如早还家。
,蜀道之难，难于上青天，侧身西望长咨嗟！
,蜀道之难，难于上青天

,【奇然】
,浔阳江头夜送客， 枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
,主人下马客在船， 举酒欲饮无管弦。
,醉不成欢惨将别， 别时茫茫江浸月。
,忽闻水上琵琶声， 主人忘归客不发。
,寻声暗问弹者谁？ 琵琶声停欲语迟。
,【沈谧仁】
,移船相近邀相见， 添酒回灯重开宴。
,千呼万唤始出来， 犹抱琵琶半遮面。
,转轴拨弦三两声， 未成曲调先有情。
,弦弦掩抑声声思， 似诉平生不得志。
,低眉信手续续弹， 说尽心中无限事。
,轻拢慢捻抹复挑， 初为霓裳后六幺。
,【奇然】
,大弦嘈嘈如急雨， 小弦切切如私语。
,嘈嘈切切错杂弹， 大珠小珠落玉盘。
,【沈谧仁】
,间关莺语花底滑， 幽咽泉流冰下难。
,冰泉冷涩弦凝绝， 凝绝不通声暂歇。
,别有幽愁暗恨生， 此时无声胜有声。
,银瓶乍破水浆迸， 铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
,曲终收拨当心画， 四弦一声如裂帛。
,东船西舫悄无言， 唯见江心秋月白。
,（念白）
,沉吟放拨插弦中， 整顿衣裳起敛容。
,自言本是京城女， 家在虾蟆陵下住。
,十三学得琵琶成， 名属教坊第一部。
,曲罢曾教善才服， 妆成每被秋娘妒。
,【奇然】
,五陵年少争缠头， 一曲红绡不知数。
,钿头银篦击节碎， 血色罗裙翻酒污。
,【沈谧仁】
,今年欢笑复明年， 秋月春风等闲度。
,弟走从军阿姨死， 暮去朝来颜色故。
,【奇然】
,门前冷落鞍马稀， 老大嫁作商人妇。
,商人重利轻别离， 前月浮梁买茶去。
,【合】
,去来江口守空船， 绕船月明江水寒。
,夜深忽梦少年事， 梦啼妆泪红阑干。
,【奇然】
,我闻琵琶已叹息， 又闻此语重唧唧。
,同是天涯沦落人， 相逢何必曾相识！
,我从去年辞帝京， 谪居卧病浔阳城。
,浔阳地僻无音乐， 终岁不闻丝竹声。
,住近湓江地低湿， 黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
,其间旦暮闻何物？ 杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
,【沈谧仁】
,春江花朝秋月夜， 往往取酒还独倾。
,岂无山歌与村笛？ 呕哑嘲哳难为听。
,今夜闻君琵琶语， 如听仙乐耳暂明。
,【合】
,莫辞更坐弹一曲， 为君翻作《琵琶行》。
,感我此言良久立， 却坐促弦弦转急。
,凄凄不似向前声， 满座重闻皆掩泣。
,座中泣下谁最多？ 江州司马青衫湿。

,Equally, you don't know
, the galaxies
,you don't know.
,That doesn't mean to say
,That you aren't doing it in just the same way as you are breathing without knowing how you breathe.
,
,And I say the same thing every single time
,Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
,When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
,She make me beg for it till she give it you
,And I say the same thing every single time
,
,I shot an angel with my father's rifle
,I shot an angel with my father's rifle
,I shot an angel with my father's rifle
,I should have set it free
,And I know one day hell will catch up with me
,And I'm sure
,I shot an angel with my father's rifle
,I should have set it free,but I let it bleed
,Made it into taxidermy,hung it on my wall
,
,
,Do you love me like you chock me?(Do you love me...)
,Do you love me like you chock me?(Love you...)
,So I remember that day with you’re on my arms
,Alongside,proving you love me
,Alongside, for staying for sure
,I don’t wanna fell in love again
,‘cause you tell me that you miss me
,I’ll never leave you again
,But you had promised me
,You’ll never leave
,Don’t feel sad ,don’t feel happy
,You’re only when you saw I’m far with you
,But I’ll can’t ,to be you
,Still remember the song that I’m at the side to the dark
,Treating so much that I’ll never remember everything
,And you’re my everything
,Do you love me like you chock me?(Say you love me)
,Do you love me like you chock me?(Love you…)

,【奇然】
,浔阳江头夜送客， 枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
,主人下马客在船， 举酒欲饮无管弦。
,醉不成欢惨将别， 别时茫茫江浸月。
,忽闻水上琵琶声， 主人忘归客不发。
,寻声暗问弹者谁？ 琵琶声停欲语迟。
,【沈谧仁】
,移船相近邀相见， 添酒回灯重开宴。
,千呼万唤始出来， 犹抱琵琶半遮面。
,转轴拨弦三两声， 未成曲调先有情。
,弦弦掩抑声声思， 似诉平生不得志。
,低眉信手续续弹， 说尽心中无限事。
,轻拢慢捻抹复挑， 初为霓裳后六幺。
,【奇然】
,大弦嘈嘈如急雨， 小弦切切如私语。
,嘈嘈切切错杂弹， 大珠小珠落玉盘。
,【沈谧仁】
,间关莺语花底滑， 幽咽泉流冰下难。
,冰泉冷涩弦凝绝， 凝绝不通声暂歇。
,别有幽愁暗恨生， 此时无声胜有声。
,银瓶乍破水浆迸， 铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
,曲终收拨当心画， 四弦一声如裂帛。
,东船西舫悄无言， 唯见江心秋月白。
,（念白）
,沉吟放拨插弦中， 整顿衣裳起敛容。
,自言本是京城女， 家在虾蟆陵下住。
,十三学得琵琶成， 名属教坊第一部。
,曲罢曾教善才服， 妆成每被秋娘妒。
,【奇然】
,五陵年少争缠头， 一曲红绡不知数。
,钿头银篦击节碎， 血色罗裙翻酒污。
,【沈谧仁】
,今年欢笑复明年， 秋月春风等闲度。
,弟走从军阿姨死， 暮去朝来颜色故。
,【奇然】
,门前冷落鞍马稀， 老大嫁作商人妇。
,商人重利轻别离， 前月浮梁买茶去。
,【合】
,去来江口守空船， 绕船月明江水寒。
,夜深忽梦少年事， 梦啼妆泪红阑干。
,【奇然】
,我闻琵琶已叹息， 又闻此语重唧唧。
,同是天涯沦落人， 相逢何必曾相识！
,我从去年辞帝京， 谪居卧病浔阳城。
,浔阳地僻无音乐， 终岁不闻丝竹声。
,住近湓江地低湿， 黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
,其间旦暮闻何物？ 杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
,【沈谧仁】
,春江花朝秋月夜， 往往取酒还独倾。
,岂无山歌与村笛？ 呕哑嘲哳难为听。
,今夜闻君琵琶语， 如听仙乐耳暂明。
,【合】
,莫辞更坐弹一曲， 为君翻作《琵琶行》。
,感我此言良久立， 却坐促弦弦转急。
,凄凄不似向前声， 满座重闻皆掩泣。
,座中泣下谁最多？ 江州司马青衫湿。

,4.诗中“______，______。______，______？”几句比喻在三国鼎立的局面下，有些人才犹豫不决，彷徨不知何去何从。作者以设问的方式，曲折地为贤才指明方向。
,5.诗中“______，______。______，______”几句，借用《管子?形解》中的典故，用比喻手法说明自己渴望多纳贤才，然后以周公自比，说自己也有周公那样的胸襟，一定会热切殷勤地接待贤才，使天下的人才都心悦诚服地归顺。表达作者胸怀大志，一统天下的愿望。

,1)《声声慢》中有七组十四个叠字，它犹如信手拈来，看似平平淡淡，无一愁字，却写得字字含愁，声声是愁，造成了一种如注如诉的音韵效果，委婉细致地表达了作者在遭受深创巨痛后的愁苦之情。这七组十四个叠字是：_____________________
,
,2)李清照的《声声慢》中写凄凉晚年的凄苦心境的句子是：________________________可见词人满心都是愁，自觉酒力压不住心愁，酒味淡了，真可谓酒入愁肠愁更愁。
,
,3)《醉花阴》词中的_______________________这三句既点明时令，也暗示出心绪不好、心事重重的原因。

,Just find way to get home
,There's a space in my heart
,Open arms for you to run to
,Baby close your eyes and take the leap
,To make believe in fairytales
,I'll meet you there
,Oh yea, I'll fall too
,See I've wanted you here
,All along but my fear
,Just keeps haunting me won't let me go
,So it's hard to say I love you
,We could be stars...
,Oh we could be stars...
,We could be stars...
,We could be stars...

,Hello darkness my old friend.
,I've come to talk with you again.
,Because a vision softly creeping
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
,And the vision that was planted in my brain
,Still remains within the sound of silence
,In restless dreams I walked alone
,narrow streets of cobblestone
,Neath the halo of a streetlamp,
,I turned my collar to the cold and damp
,When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
,split the night
,And touched the sound of silence
,And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
,People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
,People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
,To stir the sound of silence
,Fool, said I, you do not know
,silence, like a cancer, grows
,Hear my words and I might teach you
,take my arms then I might reach you
,But my words, like silent raindrops fell
,and echoed in the wells of silence
,And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they'd made
,And the sign flashed its warning in the words that it was forming
,And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
,And tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence
,I've been living with a shadow overhead
,I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
,I've been lonely for so long
,Trapped in the past
,I just can not seem to move on
,I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
,Just in case I ever need them again someday
,I've been setting aside time
,To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,Oh oh oh
,
,I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
,I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
,I know that it is out there
,There is got to be something for my soul somewhere
,I've  been looking for someone to share some lights
,Not just somebody just to get me through the night
,I could use some direction
,And I'm open to your suggestions
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart again
,I guess I am hoping you'll be there for me in the end
,Ho~
,Hu yeah~ ng~~
,There are moments when I don't know if it's real
,Or if anybody feels the way I feel
,I need inspiration
,Not just another negotiation
,
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart to you
,I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
,And if you help me to start again
,You know that I'll be there for you in the end
,Ho~
,Da da la ta la~
,Ho~
,
,
,
,
,
,Hold me close and hold me fast
,The magic spell you cast
,This is la vie en rose
,When you kiss me heaven sighs
,And tho I close my eyes
,I see la vie en rose
,When you press me to your heart
,I'm in a world apart
,A world where roses bloom
,And when you speak...angels sing from above
,Everyday words seem...to turn into love songs
,Give your heart and soul to me
,And life will always be
,La vie en rose

,I will not make the same mistakes that you did
,I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
,I will not break the way you did
,You fell so hard
,I learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I find it hard to trust
,Not only me, but everyone around me
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,I lose my way
,And it's not too long before you point it out
,I cannot cry
,Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
,I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
,Every day of my life
,My heart can't possibly break
,When it wasn't even whole to start with
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I find it hard to trust
,Not only me, but everyone around me
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,I watched you die
,I heard you cry
,Every night in your sleep
,I was so young
,You should have known better than to lean on me
,You never thought of anyone else
,You just saw your pain
,And now I cry
,In the middle of the night
,for the same damn thing
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I tried my hardest just to forget everything
,Because of you
,I don't know how to let anyone else in
,Because of you
,I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,Because of you
,I'm sitting here in a boring room.
,It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
,I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
,I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you.
,But nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
,
,I'm driving around in my car.
,I'm driving too fast, I'm drving too far.
,I'd like to change my point of view.
,I felt so lonely, I'm waiting for you.
,But nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
,
,I wonder how, I wonder why.
,Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
,And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
,I'm turning my head up and down.
,I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
,And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
,
,I'm sitting here, and I miss the power.
,I'd like to go out taking a shower.
,But there's a heavy cloud inside my mind.
,I feel so tired, and put myself into bed.
,Where nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
,
,Isolation is not good for me, isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
,I'm stepping around in a desert of joy.
,Baby, anyhow I get another toy.
,And everthing will happen, and you wonder.
,
,I wonder how, I wonder why.
,Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
,And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
,I'm turning my head up and down.
,I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
,And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
,Yet I wonder, wonder,
,I wonder how, I wonder why.
,Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
,And all that I can see,
,And all that I can see,
,And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.

,
,Sitting by my window thinking
,How I cannot be without you, missing
,Almost everything about you, when I'm
,Wondering will I make it through?
,I thought that I was over you
,A change in life has now run overdue
,Someone tell me what I'm supposed to do
,I'm beside myself
,I'm so confused
,
,There was a day
,You used to hang on every word I'd say
,But now, girl you see
,Over time the words just fade away
,You know, I still believe
,That there's a part of you that cares for me
,Oh girl, here I am
,Why do I still hold on?
,
,Too many days have passed me by
,Without your love, going crazy
,Can you tell me why?
,I can't explain what I'm feeling
,Tell myself a lie
,Baby, I am getting over u
,Gotta find a way to let you go
,But when I try, girl
,I fight it cause I love you so
,Should I deny what I'm feeling
,Just to let you know
,That baby, I am getting over u
,
,"Let me call this girl
,Just c'mon
,Pick up the phone"
,"We're sorry. All circuits are busy."
,"Damn"
,
,No more conversations on the phone
,Cause when I call you girl, you're never home
,Tell me how a broken man's this strong
,When you're supposed to be here with me, baby
,So you say you found another man
,And though I'm happy for you, understand
,That without you, I'm a different man
,I don't wanna live my life alone
,
,There'll come a day
,When remembering you won't hurt this way
,But now girl, it seems
,That this pain inside is here to stay
,You know, I wanna know
,Is there a time when you still think of me
,Cause girl, I'm afraid
,When will I breathe again?

,
,Why should it be
,That you would make a fool of me
,Girl, I never knew that trust in you
,Would tear my world apart
,No matter what I try and do
,My heart goes running back to you
,And with the way you treat me, girl

,He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
,Now walk on 'em,
,he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
,Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
,Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam

,Comes from inside a toy chest,
,but what do I do, it's locked
,I pick it and open it but it’s stuffed full of human parts

,then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter
, and batter her
,with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
,But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
,Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
,I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
,So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
,Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her

,Once upon a time there was a pretty girl
,And everyday she caught my eye
,‘Til this day I think about her
,Dream about her every night
,Cute smile with a sense of humor
,A beauty that I adore
,Nice hips with a set of lips
,She’s all that I’ve been searching for
,I know what you’re thinking
,Confess what I’m feeling
,But it’s too soon I gotta give it some time
,What if I am too late?
,What if she is taken?
,By the time I go and give it a try
,Won’t let this love Just slip away
,No more excuses I just need you, baby
,No I can’t quit
,I’ve got to try
,So I can tell our kids our fairytale
,Once upon a time…
,Once upon a time…
,So I can tell our kids our fairytale
,Once upon a time…
,Once upon a time…
,So I can tell our kids our fairytale
,Kids learn to save the princess
,This is something I would do
,I’d climb the tallest tower
,Slay a dragon just for you
,One kiss for my sleeping beauty
,To awake you from your dream
,Ride away on a strong white horse
,And turn us into king and queen
,I know what you’re thinking
,Confess what I’m feeling
,But it’s too soon I gotta give it some time
,What if I am too late?
,What if she is taken?
,By the time I go and give it a try
,Won’t let this love Just slip away
,No more excuses I just need you, baby
,No I can’t quit
,I’ve got to try
,So I can tell our kids our fairytale
,Would you be my Cinderella?
,Would you be my Belle?
,Would you let me be Dimitri to your Ariel?
,‘Cause I’d be anything
,Anything to be with you
,No matter what ahead, together. We’re the perfect two
,Won’t let this love Just slip away…
,No more excuses I just need you, baby

,
,I try to catch my breath
,It hasn't happened yet
,I'm wide awake in the middle of the night scared to death
,So I prayed God, would You make this stop
,Father please hold on to me, You're all I've got
,Carry me, carry me, carry me now
,From my sinking sand to Your solid ground
,The only way I'm ever gonna make it out
,Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now
,God carry me, carry me, carry me now
,
,Jesus calm my heart
,Come near me please
,Lord don't let these worries get the best of me
,Oh I believe, that You're still here with me
,Cause You meant what You said when You said You'd never leave
,Carry me, carry me, carry me now
,From my sinking sand to Your solid ground
,The only way I'm ever gonna make it out
,Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now
,God carry me, carry me, carry me now
,Carry me
,God carry me
,Carry me
,God carry me
,I'm at the end of myself
,I know I've got nothing left
,Feels like I'm stuck in the valley of the shadow of death
,And I've been down here so long
,I just can't find my way out
,Oh God I don't stand a chance
,Unless You carry me now
,
,God carry me now
,Carry me, carry me, carry me now
,From my sinking sand to Your solid ground
,The only way I'm ever gonna make it out
,Is if You carry me, carry me, carry me now
,God carry me, carry me, carry me now

,Hi
,
,I was born in a thunderstorm
,I grew up overnight
,I played alone
,I'm playing on my own
,I survived Hey
,I wanted everything I never had
,Like the love that comes with life
,I wore envy and I hated it
,But I survived
,I had wanted to go to a place where all the demons go
,Where the wind don't change
,And nothing in the ground can ever grow
,No hope, just lies
,And you're taught to cry in your pillow
,But I'll survive
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I found solace in the strangest place
,Way in the back of my mind
,I saw my life in a stranger's face
,And it was mine
,I had wanted to go to a place where all the demons go
,Where the wind don't change
,And nothing in the ground can ever grow
,No hope, just lies
,And you're taught to cry in your pillow
,But I'll survive
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,You took it out, but I'm still breathing
,I had made every single mistake
,That you could ever possibly make
,I took and I took and I took what you gave
,But you never noticed that I was in pain
,I knew what I wanted， I went in and got it
,Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
,I told you that I would never be forgotten
,I know it's all in spite of you.
,And I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm still breathing
,I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
,(You took it out, but I'm still breathing) （
,I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)

,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm alive
,I'm a little nutty and I know it
,but if you go back and
,take a look at my history
,you will see that I'm
,not the only one who's off his rocker
,there were many before me
,I was always labelled
,the black sheep of the family what a bad seed I
,grow to be but if you take a look
,at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree
,
,（haha） alright, look
,I'ma tell you the story
,from my side maybe you'll understand check it out
,you done witnessed
,unexplainable shit
,too insane to explain
,people run from what
,the just don't get
,maybe Shady shoulda
,just hit 'em with a little bit
,did I spit too soon?
,Should I of spoon fed 'em it?
,but I was just so eager
,to prove I was even worth
,being in the same
,
,league or the room with of the people
,of whom I was in every now and then I
,look up like I was seeking approval
,was it because of the
,pigment of my skin
,or was it a figment of
,my imagination
,maybe it bothered me
,more than it did them
,maybe it wasn't a big
,deal back then
,but to me it was, see
,what it was was
,I had developed the
,complex from being judged
,Proof spit his verse,
,now I'm next, let's see who
,I'm in the booth
,staring back to see who's mugs
,I get a reaction from,
,usually the first thumb was from
,and the rest of the
,Proof
,group backed him up
,and no one lied to
,each other cause none of us had deals
,it was real, we just
,wanted tickets for that meal
,Sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my
,family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,I said ...
,sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my
,family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,Ever since my mother
,was pregnant
,with her second egg
,cause she said
,that I had a baby sister
,who fell out of the window
,I was too young to remember
,Kansas City projects
,I was like 5, 6, and how come
,I remember Malcolm,
,Isaac, and Boogie
,if it was the projects in Missouri?
,cause those're my best
,friends until Isaac
,took my tricycle and
,my uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
,and ended up getting
,jumped and cut in the gut with a
,switch and 70-some stitches
,which is still, to this day
,why my mother still
,tries to show me some old fake picture
,of a fictitious little
,sister who never existed and this is why part of
,my life's so twisted
,but I can never be as
,sick as that bitch is
,and, by the way, that
,picture's one of my relatives
,Sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my
,family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,I said ...
,sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my
,family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,You probably have to
,peel back layers upon layers of
,pain to see why everything
,I say is so insane
,what's different about my brain that separates me
,from other players in this game? on the surface, it may
,seem like a scheme or some sort of scam
,for me to get some damn sympathy
,but that's the last thing
,I need is for people
,to walk around feeling
,sorry for me （me）
,and I'm not a G, never
,claimed to be
,I gave my vest to
,Cashis,
,he'll need it more than me
,but we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
,but if it comes our
,way, what do we, turn the other
,cheek? come on
,Sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,I said ...
,sometimes I feel like
,it's just me
,sometimes I feel like
,I'm going crazy
,but take a look at my
,family
,cause the apple don't
,fall too far from the tree
,It's not the world that's out of order
,It's me, it's me
,Guess I ran along my borders
,Just to see, just to see
,
,If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me
,But I lost my faith as I lost my way
,
,It's not the street that's made of concrete
,It's you, it's you
,Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view
,I had never taken more than I give to you
,I was led astray and I lost my way
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,It's not the light that casts the shadow
,It's doubt, it's doubt
,As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about
,
,I had never fought as hard though as I do for you
,I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,And god sent an angel
,An angel
,She's an angel
,An angel...
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,God sent an angel
,Sent an angel
,She's an angel
,An angel
,She's an aaaa... an angel
,
,It's not my life that's obsolete
,It's youth, my youth
,Guess it took a while for me to see the truth, see the truth
,I got stuck in minor details so I missed the point
,I got so much more than I bargained for...

,Slowly slip back inside of my mind

,Safe here from the silhouettes behind
,The dreams that we spin

,Oxford and Cambridge are the oldest
,and most famous universities in Britain,
,and there has always been a great rivalry
,between the two institutions.
,But the most public competition between the two
,is the annual Boat Race.
,The 2006 Boat Race will take place on 2nd April,
,and will be the 152nd race of its kind.
,Both universities are located near rivers,
,and rowing is a popular and prestigious sport.
,The very first race took place in 1829,
,when a Cambridge student challenged a school-friend studying at Oxford.
,Ever since, the defeated team from the previous year
,challenges the opposition to a rematch.
,The only times when no Boat Races took place
,were during the First and Second World Wars.

,The acting president of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan
,has dissolved the government.
,The announcement comes a month
,after he assumed executive powers
,because of the long illness of President Umaru Yar'Adua.
,Peter Greste reports from Abuja.
,There has been talk of a cabinet reshuffle
,for weeks now,
,ever since the national assembly moved Goodluck Jonathan
,from vice president to acting president two months ago.
,But few people expected the wholesale dissolution
,that came on Wednesday.
,He made no public statement,
,but the outgoing Information Minister Dora Akunyili
,said parliament's secretaries would take charge of the ministries
,until a cabinet is appointed.
,Not all ministers will lose their jobs,
,some will be reappointed,
,but this kind of sweeping change makes it clear
,the acting president is trying to assert his control
,over the cabinet made up largely of President Yar'Adua's appointees.

,was 1.56m above sea level.
,It hasn't been that high since 1986.
,Venice gets regular flooding at this time of year
,but this was the fourth deepest on record.
,Dozens of homes and businesses were inundated.
,Scores of people had to move out,
,though there are no reports of serious injuries.
,With mopping up still underway,
,the authorities say they don't yet know the final cost of repairs.
,They've appealed to the government for money from a special fund
,to help in the clear-up.
,The all-time record for high water was in 1966
,when it reached nearly two metres.
,The city then suffered widespread

,Easyjet has been under investigation here in France since 2006

,170 employees to the French authorities.
,The budget airline is accused of breaking strict labour laws
,and is now being pursued by the state prosecutor
,for millions of euros in unpaid social security
,and health insurance contributions.
,The budget airline insists
,that its staff were hired under British contracts
,and therefore were not subject to French rules.
,Orly airport, it claims,
,was merely a rest area for its workers
,and it was the planes themselves,
,and not France that served as their workplaces.
,The French authorities point out however
,that most of the Easyjet staff lived
,and paid their taxes in France
,and many were working solely on internal flights between Paris and Nice.

,The Bank of America has agreed to pay 33 million dollars

,paid out last year by its investment on Merrill Lynch.
,Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch
,to save it from collapse in a deal
,backed by American taxpayers' money.
,John Bithry reports.
,Bank of America had promised its shareholders
,that no bonuses would be paid to bankers at Merrill Lynch
,without its express permission.
,It's agreed to buy the struggling investment bank in September.
,On the same weekend

,Like Lehman, Merrill Lynch was brought
,to its knees by debt
,links to the US housing market
,that became toxic and lost its value.
,But after Merrill was rescued by BOA,
,it went ahead and paid its staff 3.6 billion dollars in bonuses anyway.
,Shortly afterwards Bank of America

,Despite the deaths, commanders say

,And the measure has been defeated by 42 votes to 30.
,Outside the ruling Labor Party,

,California has a budget shortfall of 26 billion dollars.
,State workers have been put on short time

,and to individuals who are owed tax refunds.
,Governor Schwarzenegger described the comprised deal
,as a basic agreement to close the state's huge deficit.
,He and fellow Republicans have refused to raise taxes,

,The FSB said its actions

,The mutual recriminations come at a highly sensitive time.
,Just two weeks ago, Russia sent an ambassador to Ukraine
,after a five month absence.

,A four degree average temperature rise by the 2050s
,would bring increases of 10 degrees or more in some areas
,such as the Arctic and Africa.
,It could mean a sharp decline in rainfall in some areas,
,flooding in others and extinction

,that he'll be willing to give up one of four royal navy submarines
,that carry Trident nuclear missiles.
,Officials are insisting that cost isn't a factor here.
,Here's our defence correspondent Nick Childs.
,Gordon Brown is saying he'll be ready to
,throw part of the trident force into the port
,in the context of a much bigger global disarmament deal.
,He said so in general terms before.
,This offer though is more concrete.
,There is a growing sense that to avoid what some fear
,could be a sudden cascade of new nuclear states,
,the established nuclear powers need to do more
,in terms of disarmament
,to keep the proliferation regime intact.
,The Prime Minister will hope his move
,will be seen as an important gesture.
,But the key to the process will be the actions of the big players,

,I don't belong
,Slowly slip back inside of my mind
,Where the weather's warm
,Shielding me from all judgemental eyes
,So I won't lie to you
,Because I know what love is
,And that's why ours is good
,No I won't lie to you
,Because I know what love is
,And that's why ours is good
,Desire
,With folded wings
,Safe here from the silhouettes behind
,The dreams that we spin
,Leave no ripples or no trace or sign
,So I won't lie to you
,Because I know what love is
,Because I know what love is
,And that's why ours is good
,No I won't lie to you
,Because I know what love is
,Because I know what love is
,And that's why ours is good

,It's not the world that's out of order
,It's me, it's me
,Guess I ran along my borders
,Just to see, just to see
,
,If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me
,But I lost my faith as I lost my way
,
,It's not the street that's made of concrete
,It's you, it's you
,Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view
,I had never taken more than I give to you
,I was led astray and I lost my way
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,It's not the light that casts the shadow
,It's doubt, it's doubt
,As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about
,
,I had never fought as hard though as I do for you
,I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,And god sent an angel
,An angel
,She's an angel
,An angel...

,Guess it took a while for me to see the truth, see the truth
,I got stuck in minor details so I missed the point
,I got so much more than I bargained for...
,
,
,I'm holding on your rope,
,Got me ten feet off the ground
,I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
,You tell me that you need me
,Then you go and cut me down, but wait
,You tell me that you're sorry
,Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...
,That It's too late to apologize, it's too late...
,I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late...
,
,I'd take another chance, take a fall
,Take a shot for you
,I need you like a heart needs a beat
,But it's nothing new, yeah yeah
,I loved you with the fire red
,Now it's turning blue, and you say
,Sorry like the angel heaven let me think was you
,But I'm afraid(I'm afraid)

,I don’t set alarms

,Inside my head
,Yeah yeah

,But it’s inside my veins (vein)
,Yeah yeah
,I swear I'm not insane
,Yes most likely not insane
,Everybody goes through moments of losing their clarity
,At least I’m never boring

,River in the not good times
,Oh, you taught me all that I know
,I've seen your soul grow just like a rose
,Made it through all of those thorns
,Grow into the woman I know
,And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
,When I really mean, mean to say.
,You're my all and more
,All I know you taught me, yeah
,You're my all and more
,But I need room to breathe, yeah
,I found New York laying in your arms
,We'll melt into the bedroom floor
,Never knew I'd stay for so long
,And this truth cuts not through one, but both
,Not through one, but both of us
,But it's deeper if I hold on
,And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
,When I really mean, mean to say

,Now people wanna say they know me
,Wish I had known when I was a child
,I've always been a kid tryna find where I belong
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh
,Oh oh oh
,Honestly I feel like everybody's feeling kind of lost
,And everybody knows it but nobody takes the time to talk
,Don't you know that you could be the light in somebody else's life
,All you gotta go is smile and say more than goodbye
,We could come together we could find some common ground to walk
,I never really fit in with the popular ones
,And even all my friends were always sorta dodgin' me somethin'
,I mean I started workin' early don't really party too much
,But they all went straight to hatin' me to showin' me love
,So I got for more than one I'm prepared
,To feelin' like nobody's even there
,Climbin' up the stairs they wanna stare
,I never really though that you would care
,But now that I've got your attention
,I think it's time I mention
,That we need to drop this tension
,And start to find our connections
,'Cause if love is where I stay
,I know I will find my way
,Because I've always been a kid tryna find where I belong
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh
,Oh oh oh
,It won't be long 'til we belong
,It won't be long 'til we belong ooh yeah ooh yeah
,It won't be long 'til we belong

,あなたは周りの声ばかりを聞いていて 私を信じてはくれなかった
,It's knowin' that your door is always open
,And your path is free to walk
,That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
,Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
,And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
,By forgotten words and bonds
,And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
,That keeps you in the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
,It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
,And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
,Or something that somebody said
,because They thought we fit together walkin'
,It's just knowing that the world
,Will not be cursing or forgiving
,When I walk along some railroad track and find
,That you're movin' on the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,Planted on their columns now that bind me
,Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
,And the junkyards and the highways come between us
,And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
,'cause she turned and I was gone
,I still might run in silence
,Tears of joy might stain my face
,But not to where I cannot see You
,walkin' on the back roads
,By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
,by dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
,And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
,In some train yard
,My beard a rustlin' coal pile
,And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
,Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
,I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
,That you're waitin' from the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
,I'm a new soul I came to this strange world
,hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take.
,But since I came here
,Felt the joy and the fear
,Finding myself making every possible mistake
,La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
,I'm a young soul in this very strange world hoping
,I could learn a bit about what is true and fake.
,But why all this hate?
,Try to communicate.
,Finding trust and love is not always easy to make.
,La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
,This is a happy end cause' you don't understand
,everything you have done why's everything so wrong
,This is a happy end come and give me your hand I'll take your far away.

,If you like...

,旧忆就像一扇窗，推开了就再难合上。
,谁踩过枯枝轻响，萤火绘着画屏香。
,为谁拢一袖芬芳，红叶的信笺情意绵长，
,他说就这样去流浪，到美丽的地方。
,谁的歌声轻轻、轻轻唱，
,谁的泪水静静淌。
,那些年华都付作过往，
,他们偎依着彼此说好要面对风浪。
,又是一地枯黄，枫叶红了满面秋霜。
,这场故梦里，人生如戏唱，
,还有谁登场。
,昏黄烛火轻摇晃，大红盖头下谁彷徨。
,流泪的花和荣喜堂，静静放在一旁。
,回忆像默片播放，刻下一寸一寸旧时光，
,他说就这样去流浪，到美丽的地方。
,谁的歌声轻轻、轻轻唱，
,谁的泪水静静淌。
,愿化一双鸟儿去飞翔，
,任身后哭号嘶喊着也追不上。
,又一年七月半晚风凉，斜阳渐矮只影长。
,这场故梦里，孤桨声远荡，
,去他乡，遗忘。

,This tiny South Pacific island may not look like much.
,But it was once a mountain that towered above the waves.
,Now it barely breaks the surface.
,Yet still it attracts a spectacular array of wildlife.
,There are thousands of islands just like this scattered across the Pacific,
,and all are teeming with life.
,So what has reduced the mountains of the Pacific to this?
,Almost seven miles deep,
,the Pacific is the deepest body of water on the planet.
,But sometimes, the seabed shoots to the surface.
,Behold one of nature's rarest sights - the creation of a new island.
,This is Kavachi in the Solomon Islands,
,one of the most active undersea volcanoes in the world.
,In the last 100 years, Kavachi's emerged above the waves just a handful of times,
,but so far to no avail.
,Powerful waves keep sweeping its efforts away.
,
,This is a view of the Pacific as seen from space-
,a vast expanse of water that covers almost a third of the Earth’s surface.
,Today, only 1% of this vast ocean is land,
, and much of it owes its existence to the explosive powers of volcanoes like Kavachi.
,1,500 miles north of the equator,
, perhaps the most famous group of volcanic islands in the world -
,Hawaii, still one of the most volcanically active areas on Earth.
,And this is Kilauea. Like all volcanoes, it’s plumbed into the very heart of the Earth - home to a lot of hot, angry rock.
,Rising from 60 mile below the ocean’s floor,
,this lava has flowed nonstop for 25 years.
,On the lower slopes, the lava travels at less than 100 meters an hour,
,betraying little of its awesome power.
,Nothing can survive this smouldering blanket.
,As the crust cools, it is lifted by the lava still flowing beneath it.
,The advance is relentless and unpredictable, changing direction without notice.
,Roads here are regularly swept away and some are now buried under 35 meters of rock.
,In the last 20 years, more than 200 homes have been destroyed by Kilauea’s flow.
,And it doesn’t stop here.
,
,Rivers of liquid rock plunge over the cliffs and into the water below
,This is the front line in a battle between the elements
,Most of the lava is swept away before it can settle
,But inch by inch, the island grows
,Below the waves, the battle rages on
,As the lava hits the water, it's burning at over 1,000 degrees Celsius
,Cold currents from the deep send its temperature plummeting, releasing steam with explosive consequences
,The lava fights on, but it's only a matter of time before its fire goes out
,The commotion attracts attention
,But it will be some time before it's safe to settle here
,
,Pouring into the sea, Hawaii's lava has forged almost two and a half square kilometres of new land in less than 25 years
,It's cold, hard rock - bleak, threatening and barren
,But there are some colonisers who just won't be put off
,'Ohi'a lehua, a native plant and symbol of Hawaii, is among the first to flourish on this new land
,This spindly bush will grow into a 30-metre-tall tree, its bright flowers are food for a variety of birds, like these Hawaiian honeycreepers
,But how on earth can a seed become a tree in a place where there is no soil and no sign of fresh water?
,
,The long, tenacious roots of the 'ohi'a wend their way through the cracks and penetrate deep into the rock in search of trapped water and nutrients
,Their quest leads them to a remarkable subterranean world
,Once, a raging torrent of lava flowed right through here
,When it stopped, this was all that remained - a lava tube, pitch black, constantly damp and very cold
,Can anything survive in this harsh world? Amazingly, yes
,Patches of bacteria line the walls, feeding on the minerals in the volcanic rock itself
,But that's not all
,This is the small-eyed big-eyed hunting spider - a curious name for any spider, let alone one whose eyes barely function
,But in total darkness, eyes are little use
,Although he can't see it, the spider has company
Rare crickets scale the rocks while translucent earwigs and milky millipedes forage for food. These are cave specialists, or troglobites, and they never leave the lava tube. Over time, most have lost their eyes and colour, like this plant hopper. Its tail has a curious function. Any predator biting it from behind will be left with nothing but a mouthful of irritating waxy hair. This is a place of ghostly stillness - a definite advantage for the small-eyed big-eyed hunting spider. With its super-sensitive leg hairs, it can pick up the slightest movement in the air, and it senses the cricket's presence long before it's close enough to ambush. As prey are few and far between, this may be its last meal for some time. With no light and little vegetation, only the specialists survive here. But that isn't the case for all lava tubes.
Southeast of Hawaii, straddling the equator, lie the Galapagos Islands. As on Hawaii, some of the volcanoes here are still very active. The coastline of Isabela - the largest island - is covered in volcanic rock. Here a very different kind of animal can be found in the rocky tubes. The chicks of Galapagos penguins. Without the lava tubes, they wouldn't survive. Cool and sheltered, the tubes are the perfect nursery, protecting the chicks from the unforgiving temperatures outside. Unforgiving if you're a penguin, that is. Adult Galapagos penguins only cope by doing something the chicks can't yet do. They take a dip. The adults plunge into cool waters that have travelled all the way from the Antarctic. Who says penguins can't fly? There's lots of food here, as schools of fish are drawn to the shelter of these rocky, volcanic shores. But while the parents are out fishing, their chicks are home alone. Back in the lava tube, there's something creeping around. A Sally Lightfoot crab has penguin on its mind. It's dark, so the crab can't be sure exactly what it's up against. This time, it's taken on more than it can handle. Had the encounter been just a few days earlier, the outcome might have been very different. Crabs are major predators of baby penguins.
Far to the west, in the Solomon Islands, lives an animal that depends on another characteristic of volcanoes for its survival. Heat. Meet the megapode, also known as the incubator bird. Megapodes work hard to find the perfect spot to lay their egg. And thanks to this island's volcanic springs, that spot is just a foot or two below the sand, where the temperature is an ideal 33 degrees. But some megapodes don't seem as keen to dig as others, and this can sometimes lead to fights. With the dispute finally settled, the victor lays an egg and covers it with sand. Parenting over, the megapode leaves the time-consuming job of incubation to the volcano. While the megapode thrives on a volcano's heat, back in Hawaii, there's a creature that thrives on the exact opposite.

,
,This is Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano and Hawaii's tallest mountain.
,Incredibly for a tropical island, its peak is covered with snow.
,Little can survive at such freezing heights. Bugs blown up here don't stand a chance.
,Stunned or trapped in snow, they slowly die.
,But not everything succumbs to the cold.
,
,Their cells are filled with a special kind of antifreeze that allows them to live around the snow line.
,Originally, wekiu bugs were seed-eating vegetarians, but their descendants have adapted to this hostile environment.
,Now with a taste for blood, they are the Pacific's own vampire bugs.
,Needle-sharp mouthparts pierce their dead and dying victims before they suck out anything that's left inside.
Measured from the sea floor, the wekiu's home is the tallest mountain in the world, about a kilometre taller than Everest. But it won't hold this record forever. After millions of years of growth, this mountain is slowly but surely losing height at a rate of 20 centimetres every 100 years. In fact, it's so massive that it's buckling the sea floor beneath it and sinking into the ocean. Mauna Kea's future can be glimpsed in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. The peaks of these islands once rose much higher than this from the ocean floor. It's been almost 2 million years since their volcanoes first broke through the ocean. But erosion is washing away their volcanic cores. Now the only growth occurs just below sea level, on what was once the mountain's sloping flanks. In the shallow waters around an island's base, coral reefs rise towards the surface.
Of all the formations in the Pacific, these reefs are by far the richest in life. There are hundreds of different kinds of coral. And all are made up of millions of tiny creatures called polyps, each covered in a hard skeleton. Reefs are home to thousands of specialists, like these razorfish that blend in to the staghorn coral around them. But not all animals here need to blend in. Grey reef sharks. The reef's top predators, these sharks patrol the waters on strong currents. But without all the life on the reef here, they could never exist in such numbers. They may be idle right now, but they won't remain this way for long. As night falls, it's feeding time. Needlefish stalk the coral shallows in search of food. Predators by day, at night they become the prey. Speeding away at 20 miles an hour, the needlefish give the chasing sharks a run for their money. But it's hard to escape from so many.

,Daylight reveals another reef predator.
,Crown-of-thorns starfish,
,coral killers.
,Climbing over their prey,
,they secrete digestive juices that turn the inside of the coral to liquid.
,Then they suck out the nutrients,
,leaving nothing behind but a ghostly skeleton.
,In only a few days,
,they can kill huge swathes of the reef.
,Fortunately, coral has an unlikely ally,
,the Triton's trumpet.
,Believe it or not,
,this is a predator on the prowl.
,Its killer pounce revealed only when time is speeded up.
,An unlikely hero, perhaps.
,But the Triton's trumpet is an invaluable control on these starfish.
,And the crown-of-thorns isn't the only coral killer on the reef.
,The razor-sharp beaks of bumphead parrotfish
,also put a dent in this living landscape.
A single fish can chew its way through a staggering five tonnes of coral a year. Smaller parrotfish, colourful cousins of the bumphead, are also at it. But they all give a little back as the ground-up coral comes out as sand. This is island building of a different kind. So some of the Pacific's most elegant beaches have sprung from a less than stylish birth. Above the water, time seems to stand still. But the Pacific islands are always changing, if slowly. This is Bora Bora, a volcano in what could be called "late middle age". The sloping flanks have slipped further into the sea, pushing the reef away from the shore. A lagoon is formed. It's a patchwork of coral outcrops and sand. Protected from the powerful waves of the surrounding ocean, all kinds of animals take refuge in these calm, shallow waters.
Some take comfort in their bold appearance. But others take shelter in the coral. Such as these sedentary and appropriately named Christmas tree worms, filtering food from the gentle currents. For many, entire lives are played out within the clumps of coral. Mandarin fish. A dozen of them may inhabit one outcrop. Males are always on the hunt for a mate. And competition is fierce. Disputes start with a polite warning. The rising dorsal fin is a clear signal to back off. But sometimes, going for the jugular is the only way. The fight over, it's time to get down to business. Spawning is a brief affair. Then the eggs are left to the mercy of the current.
Life in the lagoon depends on a daily flushing of water from the open ocean. This flows in through channels formed by natural gaps in the reef. With each changing tide, a soupy river of debris and nutrients flows out of the lagoon and into the blue. This attracts all sorts of life. One regular visitor to the channels is the gently gliding manta ray. It filters out minute creatures floating in the currents. But there's more than enough to go around. Schools of snapper take the lead while a wall of fusiliers mops up the remains.
Across the South Pacific, time continues to work its magic on rock. Millions of years of erosion and sinking have reduced the volcanic mount of Maupiti to little more than a hill. Eventually, this hill will disappear too. And when it does, it will look like this - Mataiva, a coral atoll. Rising above the waves, a coral atoll's reef surrounds a shallow lagoon. Where there was once a mighty peak, now there is only water. There are thousands of atolls like Mataiva dotted around the South Pacific, their size and shape determined by the original volcano. Some atolls are round, their rings unbroken, while others have been bent out of shape by ocean currents and earthquakes. And a few span huge distances, a testament to volcanoes whose size and power were once truly colossal. Rangiroa in French Polynesia. Over 30 miles wide, its lagoon is so large that if you were floating in its centre, you wouldn't see land in any direction.
The story of land building in the South Pacific may start with volcanic eruptions, but it doesn't end there. A volcano once formed an island here, but it sank back below the surface. Now it's on the rise again. This is the extraordinary Kingman Reef. Over 3,000 miles from the nearest continent, it is one of the last pristine coral reefs left in the world. As tourism and fishing are banned here, the reef is about as close as you'll get to the Pacific as it used to be before humans arrived. Part of what makes Kingman extraordinary is the 200 types of coral found here. But there's also something else. And it's helping to build the reef. Giant clams, everywhere. More than you'll see on any other reef in the world.
,
,
,
,
,
,When giant clams spawn,
,they expel millions of eggs into the water.
,And when one starts,
,all the others quickly follow.
,The sea soon turns cloudy with life.
,Giant clams can live for over 50 years.
,But it's their death
,that is crucial to the creation of land in Kingman Reef.
,These few hundred metres of coral rubble
,and dead clams
,are the only visible signs of Kingman above the water,
,providing a valuable rest stop to passing voyagers.
,Eventually, seeds brought by ocean currents and birds
,will turn it into a new island.
,And once vegetation is established,
,wildlife is never far behind.
Being good long-distance travellers, fairy terns island-hopped their way here to French Polynesia. The ancestors of these blue lorikeets, however, were brought here by some of the earliest Polynesians. It could be described as the ultimate honeymoon destination. Though the waters off these shores don't always appear too inviting. Blacktip sharks have adapted to swim in less than a foot of water. They come to these shallows to hunt for smaller fish. Like Kingman Reef, all signs of these islands' volcanic past have long since disappeared. But without it, land could never have got started here. In the very west of the Pacific, however, volcanoes have had a helping hand.
,
,Palau—the jewel of Micronesia
,As with many islands in the Pacific,its volcanic speaks still linger on
,Beyond their shores are other familiar scenes
,Barrier reefs
,And small coral atolls
,But here,there’s something different
,The reefs of Palau have risen from the deep
,not slowly,likely Kingman,
,But suddenly,35 million years ago,powerful earthquakes forced them high above the waves
,And Palau’s rock islands were created
,Some are up to 200 metres tall
,Exposed cliffs now reveal their rock’s true origins
,It’s limestone,created by crushed coral and ancient shells
,Since those earthquakes,there’s been another big change here
,
At the end of the last ice age, large areas of this landscape became flooded as the ice melted. In the process, over 70 marine lakes were created. Cut off from the outside world, these lakes produced some unique animals. One of these was an ocean predator with long tentacles. But here, it evolved into a harmless, graceful wanderer. Jellyfish normally feed on small fish. But in the lakes, there was little prey. So their bells have become a home to millions of tiny photosynthesising algae. When exposed to sunlight, these algae produce sugars, which in turn provide their hosts, the jellyfish, with food. Now, each day, the jellyfish migrate across the lake, following the arc of the sun. Their only obstacle, the occasional anemone that tries to catch them as they float past. And sometimes fails. So, with little danger, and a never-ending supply of food, the jellyfish have multiplied, and multiplied, and multiplied. It's strange to think that Palau was once just a piece of endless ocean. But nothing lasts forever. The never-ending rise and fall of land in the Pacific will continue to produce strange and wonderful worlds like these. At the start of it all will always be the incredible natural force that created land here in the first place - the ocean volcano.
,

,
,The South Pacific Islands are the most isolated in the world.
,Some are more than 4,000 miles from the nearest continent.
,The odds against any life reaching these islands,
,and flourishing, were once minute.
,But no matter how remote they may be,
,all have been colonised,
,first by plants and animals and then by humans.
,So who were those castaways
,and how did they ever reach these far-flung islands?
,
,
,
,
,
,More than twice the width of the Atlantic Ocean,
,the South Pacific is 10,000 miles wide.
,Many of the pioneers who made it to the most easterly islands
,set off from its far-western corner.
,And, for most, New Guinea was the launch pad.
,Three times the size of Britain,
,this is the largest tropical island in the world
,and the richest in animal life
,with some truly eye-catching residents.
,Like this Goldie's Bird of paradise.
,Never filmed before,
,Goldie's are just one of New Guinea's 38 species of bird of paradise,Goldie
,all famed for their spectacular plumage.

,Do they treat you like a star
,Do they sing for you
,the songs you always liked
,You’re scared of all the lies
,All you want is a sign
,Telling you where to go
,There’s no other way to turn
,The only lesson you learned
,is to never forget your way back home
,I love you love you love you
,just the way you are
,Love you love you love you
,the way you are
,There’s nothing in this world
,that I would ever want
,than to have you back in my arms.
,Waiting for you
,deep in the night
,to tuck you into bed
,I’m waiting for you
,arms open wide
,I want to see you smile tonight
,Love you love you love you
,just the way you are
,Love you love you love you
,the way you are
,There’s nothing in this world

,But I don’t know why you’re letting me in
,Wanna know why
,Is this love?
,Is this your way of saying (that) you care?
,Do you know my favorite song?
,It’s so crazy I can’t think of someone else

,You wherever
The air feels heavy I can’t breath in here
A long long time ago liked having you near me
But now I’m big and sometimes even strong
I’m strong enough to see that you were wrong
I never needed you, needed you with me
The echo of your voice still in my head
I try my best forgetting what you said
I’ve heard so many truer things since then
From braver and better men
I never needed you, needed you with me
It’s time to shake the shadows of you from over my head
These shoulders aren’t strong enough for two
It’s time to shake the shadows of you from over my head
So many things I wish I could undo
I'm always on the run and I hate copy paste for god's sake
You had this power everyone could see
They didn’t know you stole it all from me
I’ve seen you try to get by on your own
Haunted by the chances you have blown
‘Cause you needed me needed me with you
It’s time to shake the shadows of you from over my head
These shoulders aren’t strong enough for two
It’s time to shake the shadows of you from over my head
So many things I wish I could undo

,And in this golden field of dreams
,I know I’m in a place

,It's the little things
,I don't need much at all who knew it
,To my fears and my pride

,My child arrived just the other day
,came to the world in the usual way
,But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
,He learned to walk while I was away,
,and he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew, he said:
,I'm gonna be like you, dad,
,You know I'm gonna be like you
,And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon
,Little boy blue and the man on the moon
,When you coming home, dad, I don't know when
,But we'll get together then,
,You know we'll have a good time then.
,My son turned ten just the other day, he said
,Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play
,teach me to throw, I said not today,
,I got a lot to do, he said that's okay
,And he walked away but his smile never dimmed, he said
,I'm gonna be like him, yeah
,You know I'm gonna be like him.
,And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon
,Little boy blue and the man on the moon
,When you coming home, dad, I don't know when
,But we'll get together then,
,You know we'll have a good time then.
,Well, he came from college just the other day
,So much like a man, I just had to say
,Son I'm proud of you, can ya sit for a while?
,He shook his head and said with a smile
,What I'd really like, dad, is borrow the car keys
,See ya later, can I have them please?

,You know we'll have a good time then.
,I've long since retired, my sons moved away
,I called him up just the other day.
,I said, I'd like to see you, if you don't mind, he said
,I'd love to, dad, if I can find the time.
,You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
,But it's sure nice talking to you, dad
,It's been sure nice talking to you.
,And as I hung up the phone it occured to me,
,He'd grown up just like me,
,My boy was just like me.
,And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon
,Little boy blue and the man on the moon
,When you coming home, son, I don't know when

,Замотали мои ноги с ночи до утра.
,Моя вера медленно доходит до нуля,
,В этом городе, городе больше нет тебя.
,:
,В городе, где нету тебя, подают холодный чай.
,В городе, где нету тебя, провожают и не встречают.
,В городе, где нету тебя, зиму сменяет май.
,В городе люди во снах только видели океаны.
,Я знаю, что между нами толстая струна
,И оборвать её никак не получится.
,Мы встречаемся с тобой только лишь во снах,
,Каждый раз сильно радуясь случаю.
,И я капкан, ты петля, лети мотылёк,
,Забывай меня через тысячи дорог.
,Не вини меня, это не моя вина,
,Просто в городе, в городе нет тебя.
,Припев:
,Серые дома, полупустые города,
,Замотали мои ноги с ночи до утра.
,Моя вера медленно доходит до нуля,
,В этом городе, городе больше нет тебя.
,Серые дома, полупустые города,
,Замотали мои ноги с ночи до утра.
,Моя вера медленно доходит до нуля,
,В этом городе, городе больше нет тебя.

,往事蒙尘在我眉睫之间，
,方今重回到江南旧院。
,残朽了，岁月刻的牌匾，
,叩开回忆之门一问尘缘。
,我乘乌篷船翩然过桥亭，
,与清明桥上嫣然那个你，
,不经意，相看成了风景。
,我蘸酒写诗而你误入诗句。
,我轻弹古筝歌遍，
,方知断了的琴弦，再也唱不出思念。
,你刺绣化梦的蝶，
,后觉断了的红线，再也绣不出情缘。
,执手昨日疏影西窗前，灯花落尽檐外月一剪，
,棋局与人生，哪个更多劫？
,孑然今宵微雨断桥边，往事焚灰你香冢长眠，
,从此处处烟波，都似你眉眼。
,多年后我又乘船过江南，
,可清明桥上再无你倩影，
,未留意，眷顾成了曾经。
,一道古镇清风长叹了半声。
,玉笛余音向天阙，流年也沉默封缄，
,为你静敛岁月吊唁。
,黛瓦青砖雨不绝，我蒙霜冷彻心间，
,为你倾尽悼念。
,或许怨天命旁观冷眼，或许问天命总妒良缘，
,说莫失莫忘，无常总上演。
,天涯一隔两端有多远，怎敌一隔阴阳两相望，
,从此处处苍翠，都似你裙边。
,忆江南山悠然水悠然，你眸凝万水眉黛千山，
,待百年与你，共长眠江南。
,忆江南船依然桥依然，与你将前缘再续编撰：
,若有三生一世，再遇你江南。

,文案：
,1.诗中化用《诗经·郑风·子衿》中的诗句，“______，______。______，______”，这几句点明了“愁”的一个原因，即对人才的渴求。作者所引用的诗经原是写恋人之间的思念，可见诗人对人才的一片深情。
,2.诗中化用《诗经?小雅?鹿鸣》中的诗句，“______，______。______，______”，表达了作者欢迎贤才的心情。一旦四方贤才光临舍下，作者将奏瑟吹笙，宴请宾客，不甚欣喜。
,3.诗中“______，______？______，______”几句用比喻的手法，以明月的可望而不可取，比喻求贤才而不得，点明了忧愁不断的原因。
,4.诗中“______，______。______，______？”几句比喻在三国鼎立的局面下，有些人才犹豫不决，彷徨不知何去何从。作者以设问的方式，曲折地为贤才指明方向。
,5.诗中“______，______。______，______”几句，借用《管子?形解》中的典故，用比喻手法说明自己渴望多纳贤才，然后以周公自比，说自己也有周公那样的胸襟，一定会热切殷勤地接待贤才，使天下的人才都心悦诚服地归顺。表达作者胸怀大志，一统天下的愿望。

,是鸟也，海运则将徙于南冥，
,——南冥者，天池也。

,《齐谐》者，志怪者也。
,《谐》之言曰：
,“鹏之徙于南冥也，水击三千里，

I am a very generous person. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to give people presents. It's not just about physical presents but there is the emotional side of giving presents, being together, the satisfaction from giving people presents and receiving presents. I think it is rewarding to give as well. To make someone else happy is always a nice feeling if you care about them. Sometimes I think the giving is more fun. You pick something that you think that's pretty perfect for someone. I think it's always nice and exciting to watch their reaction when they see it. So sometimes that's more fun then getting a gift yourself. What's the worst gift you've ever received? Probably socks or something. Something really generic and probably pulled out of their closet at the last minute. Probably re-gifted.

,I try to get down to a gym when I can.
,It makes you feel good,
,makes you feel confident,
,makes you feel fit ...
,and it's fun!
,I'll go to an exercise class
,when I realise I haven't done any exercise for a while.
,And I feel like I should go more.
,Soon I go for maybe three weeks,
,then I stop again.
,I go mountain-climbing.
,I do running.
,Football and gym.
,I like roller-blading.
,I go jogging.
Have you ever had any dancing lessons? I did ballet and tap until I was about seven. I think I just did it because all my friends did it. I do music videos; I do live shows with a couple of bands. So once or twice a month maybe. No, but I wish I had. When do you dance now? In the shower. I've been dancing since the age of three. I used to do ballet, tap, modern, jazz, national, street. Yeah I’ve taken up salsa recently as well. And how does dancing make you feel? Alive. When I'm dancing I don’t really think about anything else. It kind of is my own little world. When you're dancing it's just you in the moment.
I've just moved into a new flat with my girlfriend and we've planted tomato plants and herbs outside on the balcony. This past weekend we visited a friend in the countryside and they have a big garden and when I saw that garden, all things they've got planted there, I felt quite jealous, quite jealous of the amount of space they've got. Well, this year my friend went travelling round the world, got redundancy so... So you were jealous of her chance? I was jealous of her chance to be paid to go and see the world. When I was just dating my husband and we went to a party and someone asked him to dance and he did, just to be sort of friendly, and I was just madly jealous.

,What do you love about driving?
,Just the rev of the engine, just cruising around really.
,That I can go wherever I want and not have to ask for a lift.
,And what do you hate about driving?
,Traffic is a problem, parking is a problem, congestion charge…
,Just congestion and frustration because of the traffic.
,Expense, petrol, maintaining the car.
,
,
,
,
,
,I think of Hong Kong
,'cos that's where I live
,and I just think of China and Chinese society
,and festivals and food.
,I suppose there are lots of meanings, isn't it?
,Love, anger, danger. All sorts, really.
,We use it to 'stop' at traffic lights and for attention,
,'cos red is quite a bright colour like that.
,Do you ever see red?
,No. I'm a very calm, cool and collected person.
,Very fiery, angry, maybe quite a socialist colour.
,Quite an inspirational colour as well.
,I think it's the most emotive of all colours.
Somebody who I can just talk to, have an interesting conversation. If you just click with anybody and you're able to have a sensible, adult conversation of course - that would be an ideal date. Especially a candlelit dinner! Now we're talking. That's really hard. I don't know actually. Maybe something… I think we'd stay at home and the guy would make me dinner, if he could cook. I think my ideal date would just be at home. Maybe me cooking a meal, impressing someone that I was trying to impress, maybe. I really like to cook and I really like people when they enjoy my food, so I'd really like just a very simple night at home.
Snakes. I have a fear of snakes. I just don't like them. I know they aren't particularly dangerous but I just don't like the way they move and I know they are not slimy but I just do not like them at all. Spiders. Pretty much just spiders. No other bugs – not flies, not cockroaches. Just spiders. It's really quite irritating. I'm afraid of dogs and it's all my mum's fault. When we were little and we'd be walking down the street there'd be a dog coming towards us and we'd cross the street so from a very young age I've always grown up with like dogs being some sort of scary thing. I'm afraid of heights. This is my secret. I really can't stand being in tall buildings. It's kind of weird but this is my phobia.
,
,
,
,
,
,I'm a tea person
,'cos firstly you can do more things with tea than coffee
,and apparently it's much better for your health
,as well 'cos coffee is quite addictive
,and tea isn't so much so.
,I know that coffee has caffeine to make you awake
,so I use tea as a substitute
,so I use tea as my 'wake up' in the morning to get started.
,I'm more of a coffee person
,because coffee has a lot of caffeine;
,it keeps you awake at night
,so that's useful
,when you're doing your late night studies.
,I hate the taste of coffee!
,
,
,
,
,
,If you had three wishes,
,what would they be?
,I suppose it would be in the area of world peace, that sort of thing.
,Well, world peace.
,World peace.
,World peace is the most important.
,Yes.
,Erm… visit of many towns in the world,
,and er, that's it.
,Probably for a happy family life,
,not to work so hard and to have more of a family life with the children.
,Health, happiness and love.
,Have an Aston Martin. An Aston Martin car!
,Wow. Okay well I hope you get your Aston Martin car.
,Thank you.

How about listening to a man talking about what makes him sneeze or finding out about British motorways? If all this sounds mind-numbingly dull, it's a good thing that you missed a recent one-day event called Boring 2011, in which these and other tedious topics were discussed. Contrary to what you might expect, the conference was sold out and judging by the press reports of the day, the crowd were far from bored stiff. In fact, they were engaged and stimulated. The aim of Boring 2011 was to celebrate "the mundane, the obvious and the overlooked". The organiser James Ward sees boredom as a reaction against the noise and overstimulation of modern media and advertising: "Boring is the opposite of that. It's slow, makes you think more. It's about stillness and patience." So can watching paint dry really be a positive experience? Some psychologists think so. Dr Richard Ralley from Edge Hill College in Lancashire thinks that boredom during holidays could benefit pupils, since it gives their brains a chance to rest. (There's no rest for their parents of course – by the end of the summer the kids are climbing the walls.) Let's face it – most of us have to learn to deal with monotony. How else would we survive all those dreary household chores, that repetitive trip to work or, worst of all, that coma-inducing meeting in the afternoon?
I do have some New Year's resolutions usually, yeah. I commit to something, I tell my wife and she holds me to account. I gave up drinking after New Year's Eve last year and I stuck to it. I often promise myself I am going to be really good, usually about eating, but I am a complete disaster. I start off with the best will in the world and then ... if I am happy I eat and if I am sad I eat so I am on a losing streak. Actually I am a person who likes to do resolutions all the time. I like to try to improve myself all the year round. I am that kind of person who is very driven so ... I am trying to do the London Marathon this year so ... once I make a decision I try and do it. I don't make New Year's resolutions because I break them as soon as New Year is here. I haven't made one. I won't be making one. I've got nothing to give up!
The World Health Day is on 7th April. It marks the founding of the World Health Organization and is an opportunity to draw worldwide attention to a subject of major importance to global health each year. World Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of health facilities and the readiness of health workers who treat people affected by emergencies. Health centers and staff provide vital health care in communities every day. In disasters, their services are in even greater demand: treating injuries, preventing illnesses and caring for people's urgent health needs. A safe hospital that continues to function at best capacity during and after a disaster or other emergency is a safe haven that protects lives. Safe health facilities are a joint responsibility, requiring crucial support from other sectors to ensure essential lifelines. When health facilities stop functioning, it is a double blow to a devastated community.
What happens to those old computers once they've been abandoned for newer models? The refuse from discarded electronics, also known as e-waste, often ends up in landfills instead of being recycled. And that means toxic substances like lead and mercury that are commonly used in these products can contaminate the land, water and air. The United States generates more e-waste than any other nation. Some of that waste is recycled. For example, steel, aluminum and copper are often stripped from outdated machines and reused in newer models. But even recycled parts come at a price. An estimated 50 to 80 percent of e-waste collected in the United States for recycling is exported to areas such as China or India or Pakistan, where workers taking apart the old machines are handling toxic chemicals that can pose serious health problems. Luckily, some manufacturers are beginning to assume greater responsibility for what happens to their products after they become out-of-date.
With the development of computer-technology, computers are becoming increasingly popular all over the world. The computer is being used in many fields. In industry, business, education, medicine, nearly  all walks of life, computers have made their appearance, providing great speed and accuracy for our work. Computers have been used in the home, offices, laboratories and research institutions, acting as  the most efficient and multifunctional instruments for calculating, sorting, filing, recording and distributing. And they have also become a window through which we can understand the world better. During the past fifty years, the computer has been rapidly advanced. Ever since the computer came into being, it has experienced the development of several generations. The earliest computers were of great size, and   had no match for the latest electronic computers  in speed and accuracy. Now efforts are being made not only to bring the hardware to perfection, but also to improve the quality of the software.
Cell phones are an unavoidable part of daily life. Even if you do not own one yourself, you are exposed to them all the time whenever you enter the public areas. Most people think of their cell phones as something that they" just could not live without." Make sure you are informed about the potential health hazards associated with cell phone use that the cell phone companies do not want you to know. While studies are not conclusive, scientists are beginning to suspect that cell phone use could contribute to everything from headache to brain cancer. This is because cell phones emit electromagnetic waves and small amounts of radiation. While research done in the 1990's indicated that the radiation using a cell phone could expose you to is not really enough to do any damage, many experts are now abolishing that opinion. They recommend that, at the very least, children, teens and young adults avoid using cell phones except in emergencies.
Sight is very effective at giving exact information over considerable distances. If the viewed object is moving, it can tell us much about the speed and direction of this movement as well as allowing us to identify it. For all this to happen we need to see it. This means our eyes have to be looking in the correct direction. Light waves do not go around objects very well, so we cannot see an object if it is hidden behind another object. This does put limits on what sight can achieve. Sight is an easy sense to use, because during the day we are surrounded by light supplied by the sun. This light bounces off things and brings us information about them. However, when the sun sets on a cloudy night, the light is mostly gone, and then vision shall become less useful as a sense.
A social networking service is an online service that focuses on building and reflecting of social networks or social relations among people. A social networking service essentially consists of three things. First, a representation of each user. Second, his or her social links. And third, a variety of additional services. Most social networking services are Web-based. They provide means for users to interact over the Internet, such as email and instant messaging. Online community services are sometimes considered as a social networking service in a broader sense. However, a social networking service usually means an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks. The main types of social networking services are ones containing category places, means to connect with friends and a recommendation system linked to trust. Many networks focus on providing both services and community to individuals with shared interests.
Online consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the Internet. It consists in using electronic technologies to ask a group of people their opinions on one or more specific topics, allowing for exchanges between participants. Generally speaking, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented. For instance, to identify or access options or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables the government to draft more citizen-centered policies. As the Internet gains in popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy making through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. Through online engagement, the government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public, as it has a more direct route to citizen opinion through the Internet. Many countries are integrating online consultations using various methods and for a range of purposes.
The US is one of the few industrialized countries that do not have a centralized health insurance system. Development of a universal  health care program in the US may be difficult because  taxes are too low to finance it. But the  federal government has become more involved in all aspects of health care. Health insurance plans are widely various, but most Americans depend on employ-sponsored health insurance. Health  maintenance organization are becoming popular, and many companies have carried out their own programs to insure  employees  . The government has provided supplementary health care for those who do not have access to private health insurance by the  establishment of Medicare and Medicaid. Seventeen percent of the  non-elderly population is uninsured, and has severely limited access to health care. The government is increasingly  burdened by the health care crisis, and needs to become invovled in heallth care policy-making on the federal lever. 



     


美国是当今世界极少数工业化的国家之一，却缺少一套集中化的卫生保障体系。由于税太低，资金不足，在美国实现医疗保健普及化的目标存在困难。联邦政府已经更加深入管理医疗保健各个方面的问题。卫生保障计划越来越多样化，但是大部分美国企业依赖员工式赞助的医疗保险制度。医疗维护组织愈来愈受到大众青睐的同时，许多企业执行自己的公司计划，以保障员工利益。政府也制定了医疗保健补充条例，专门适用于个别无法享受医疗保险和医疗援助的人群。还是17%的人没有得到医疗保障的，且相当难享受医疗保障。医疗保障危机慢慢地加重了政府的负担，而政府开始参与联邦制医疗保健政策的制定也是必须的。
The American flag is composed of thirteen parallel red stripes that alternate with white ones. A blue-colored rectangle in the upper left quarter of the flag contains fifty white five-pointed stars. They are arranged in nine parallel rows where the rows containing six stars each,  alternate with rows consisting of five stars . The stars stand for the fifty states of the United States, while the thirteen stripes celebrate the thirteen colonies that rebelled against the British. The flag is popularly accepted as a symbol of the establishment of the US Government and the rights promised to the American citizens through the Bill of Rights. It also represents the principles of individual and personal liberty put forth by the Declaration of Independence. There is no legal definition for the symbolism of the colors used in the American flag. However, it is said that white signifies purity, red stands for bravery and  blue for perseverance and justice. 



   


美国国旗由十三条红白相间的平行线组成。一个蓝色的矩形框里包括五十科白色的五角星。它们在旗帜上面的四分之一处被平行排列成9行，每行6颗。星星代表美国的五十个州，而十三条平行线表示美国脱离英国殖民统治重建的十三年。这个旗被普遍认为是美国政府建立的标志。它也代表了个人权利以及独立宣言倡导的个人自由和人权宣言赋予美国市民的权利。美国国旗上颜色的象征意义没有法律的定义。然而，据说白色表示纯洁，红色代表勇气，蓝色代表毅力与正义
UN has claimed that the number of people on the globe should as expected reach 9.2 billion in 2050, which will include elderly persons numbering 1 billion. One of the surprises is that population growth is most concentrated in the 60 plus age group, which is expected almost to triple. Whilst many regard the aging of the population as a triumph of a civilized and caring society, others see it as a major problem facing the community. The increasing aging population will cause the increase in the dependency ratio. This means that there will be more people claiming benefits such as state pensions, and less people working and paying income taxes. Thus, those in work will have to pay higher taxes. This could create disincentives to work and for firms to invest, therefore there could be a fall in productivity growth. The shortage of workers could push up wages, causing wage inflation.


联合国发表声明称预计全球人口在2050年会达到92亿人次，其中包括一亿老年人。 令人惊讶的是人口增长大多集中在60岁以上，据预计会翻三倍。 尽管很多人认为老年人口增长现象被很多人认为是民主权利与和谐社会的胜利，但其他人认为这是当代社会面临的一个主要问题。 老年人口的增长会导致依赖比率的提高。这意味着会有更多人拿到国内老年抚恤金，更少的人去工作并缴税。 因此，在工作的人需要交更高的税。 这会打击工人和投资者的积极性，阻碍生产力的提高。 工人的短缺和老年问题会导致通货膨胀。
The US federal assistance is defined as any federal program, service, and activity provided by the federal government that directly assists or benefits the American public in the areas of education, health, public safety, public welfare, and public works among others. The assistance is provided and administered by federal government agencies. In order to provide federal assistance in an organized manner, the federal government provides assistance through federal agencies. It is the agency's responsibility to adequately provide assistance. Agencies are also to manage, account, and monitor the responsible use of federal funds which were utilized for that assistance. The agencies then supply the assistance to recipients through individual programs. The programs can refer to any number of activities or services provided by agencies. Programs are assigned to offices within a federal agency. They may include administrative personnel which work directly or indirectly with the program. Each program is created with a specific purpose.
At the other end of the malnutrition scale, obesity is one of today's most visible, yet most neglected, public health problems. Paradoxically, co-existing with under-nutrition, a global epidemic of overweight and obesity is taking over many parts of the world. If immediate action is not taken, millions will suffer from an array of serious health disorders. Obesity is complex condition, one with serious social and psychological dimensions, that affects virtually all age and threatens to overwhelm both developed and developing countries. As of 2000, the number of obese adults is over 300 million. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the obesity epidemic is not restricted to industrialized societies. In developing countries, it is estimated that over 115 million people suffer from obesity-related problems. Generally, although men may have higher rates of overweight, women have higher rates of obesity. For both, obesity poses a major risk for serious diet-related non-communicable diseases, including stroke and certain forms of cancer.
Illiteracy in Africa is at extremely high levels. 21 nations have adult literacy rates below 50 percent and overall 4 of every 10 Africans are illiterate. Achieving higher rates of literacy is a vital part of the effort to eradicate African poverty. But the relationship between the two is complex, because the efforts of poverty are a major obstacle to literacy. Given the widespread proverty, few parents can afford to send their children to school. Raising literacy rates depends on governments' making schools and programs for adult education available. Some governments are making a real effort to improve literacy. However, many government officials are either indifferent or corrupt, giving education a low priority, or the government efforts are poorly organized and implemented. Non-governmental organizations can help, but they must depend on local governments to step up and become a parter, rather than an obstacle to progress.
Recycling timber is the process of turning waste timber into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change, prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product. Consumers commonly believe that by purchasing recycled wood, the demand for green timber will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Recycled timber is now used as a construction product. It has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. Wood recycling is a subject which has in recent years taken an even greater role in our lives. The problem, however, is that although many local authorities like the idea of recycling, they do not fully support it.

,I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
,She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
,She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
,Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
,She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
,She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun
,Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
,Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
,
,You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "baby, I just wanna dance"

,You are my pretty little Galway girl
,
,You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
,And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
,As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
,After dancing to Kaleigh,singing to trad tunes
,I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
,A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
,Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
,And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
,
,You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "baby,I just wanna dance"
,"I just wanna dance"
,"I just wanna dance"
,"I just wanna dance"
,"I just wanna dance with my pretty little Galway girl"
,You are my pretty little Galway girl
,Galway girl
,You are my pretty little Galway girl
,
,And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
,I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
,Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
,As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
,I walked her home then she took me inside
,To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
,I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
,About a Galway girl and a perfect night

,She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
,She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
,Said it was one of my friend’s songs do you want to drink on?
,She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
,She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shot gun
,Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
,Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

,Paint yourself a picture
,Of what you wish you looked like
,Maybe then they just might
,Feel an ounce of your pain
,Come into focus
,Step out of the shadows
,It's a losing battle
,There's no need to be ashamed
,Cause they don't even know you
,All they see is scars
,They don't see the angel
,Living in your heart
,Let them find the real you
,Buried deep within
,Let them know with all you've got
,That you are not your skin
,When they start to judge you
,Show them your true colors
,And do one to others
,As you'd have done to you
,Just rise above this
,Kill them with your kindness
,Ignorance is blindness
,They're the ones that stand to lose
,Cause they don't even know you
,All they see is scars
,They don't see the angel
,Living in your heart

,Buried deep within

,That you are not your skin
,Well they don't even know you
,All they see is scars

,
,oh they say people come, they say people go.
,This particular diamond was extra special
,And though you might be gone
,And the world may not know
,Still I see you, celestial
,Like a lion you ran
,A Goddess you rolled
,Like an eagle you circled
,In perfect purple
,So how come things move on?
,How come cars don’t slow?
,When it feels like the end of my world?
,When I should but I can’t let you go?
,But when I’m cold, cold
,Oh when I’m cold, cold
,There’s a light that you give me
,When I’m in shadows
,There’s a feeling you give me, an everglow
,Like brothers in blood
,Sisters who ride
,And we swore on that night
,We'd be friends 'til we died
,But the changing of winds
,And the way waters flow
,Life as short as the falling of snow
,And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
,But when I'm cold, cold
,In water rolled, salt
,I know that you’re with me
,And the way you will show
,And you’re with me wherever I go
,And you give me this feeling this everglow
,Oh, what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
,Yeah, I live for this feeling this everglow
,So if you love someone, you should let them know
,Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
,I complicated our lives
,By falling in love with him
,I complicated our live
,Now I'm losing my only friend
,I don't know why, I had to try
,Living my life on the other side
,Now I'm so confused
,I don't know what to do
,He loves me, He loves me not
,She loves me, She loves me not
,He loves me, He loves me not
,She loves me...
,I started blurring the lines
,Because I didn't care
,I started crossing the line
,Cause you were never there
,No where to turn,
,No one to help,
,It's almost like I don't even know myself
,Now I have to choose
,I don't know what to do

,
,Driving down the wrong road
,Playing games and feeling low
,Messing with my mind
,How'd you do it this time?
,Don't know where it all goes
,Leaving me behind
,Can you take a step back?
,Tired of playing catch up
,Would it really hurt you that much?
,It's right in front of your face
,Yet you look the wrong way
,Can't you feel my touch?
,But it feels like every time you look at me that way
,You feel the love in your heart, but you don't know what to say
,
,I'm tired of playing games, let's throw the board away
,Oh, can you give love a try, even if it's for a day?
,Threw away your first chance
,What happend to our romance?
,Let's do it a second time
,I can stand here all day
,Soon I'll look the other way
,Why can't you just be mine?
,Let's embrace the sunshine
,Winter's gone and you'll be fine
,Darling, let's believe in us
,It's right in front of your face
,Yet you look the wrong way
,Can't you feel my touch?
,But it feels like every time you look at me that way
,You feel the love in your heart, but you don't know what to say
,
,I'm tired of playing games, let's throw the board away
,Oh, can you give love a try, even if it's for a day?
,Oh, can we give love a try?
,Oh, can we give love a try?
,
,But it feels like every time you look at me that way
,You feel the love in your heart, but you don't know what to say
,
,Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
,I tried to be chill,
,but you're so hot that I melted
,I fell right through the cracks
,Now I'm trying to get back
,Before the cool done run out
,I'll be giving it my bestest
,And nothing's gonna stop me
,but divine intervention.
,I reckon, it's again my turn
,
,To win some or learn some.
,But I won't hesitate
,
,No more, no more.
,It cannot wait,
,I'm yours.
,
,enn enn…
,
,Well, open up your mind and see like me,
,Open up your plans and damn you're free.
,Look into your heart and you'll find love,
,love, love, love.
,Listen to the music of the moment,
,people dance and sing,
,We're just one big family
,And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved,
,loved, loved, loved, loved
,
,So I won't hesitate
,No more, no more.
,It cannot wait,
,I'm sure.
,There's no need to complicate.
,Our time is short.
,This is our fate,
,I'm yours.
,doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo……
,Do you want to come on,
,scooch on over closer, dear
,And I will nibble your ear
,So do you want to come
,wo-wo-wo-wo
,I've been spending way too long
,checking my tongue in the mirror
,And bending over backwards just to
,try to see it clearer
,But my breath fogged up the glass
,And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
,I guess what I'll be saying
,is there ain't no better reason
,To rid yourself of vanities and
,just go with the seasons.
,It's what we aim to do.
,Our name is our virtue.
,But I won't hesitate
,No more, no more.
,It cannot wait,
,I'm yours.
,Well, open up your mind and see like me,
,Open up your plans and damn you're free.
,Look into your heart and you'll find
,that the sky is yours.
,So please don't, please don't, please don't...
,There's no need to complicate.
,'Cause our time is short.

,You came to lift me up
,Life is a drink, and love's a drug
,Oh, now I think I must be miles up
,When I was a river, dried up
,You came to rain a flood
,
,And said drink from me, drink from me

,先生：日本の人はお互いの生活に
,利益のあることを喜び合います。
,また、不利のあることを悲しみ合うのです。

,学生：そうですか。
,あいさつの言葉はとても大切ですね。
,先生：ええ、
,あいさつの言葉は日本文化の一面を表しています。
,みなさんは日本語を勉強するとともに、

,第十九課  インタビュー
,（前文）
,最近、中国へ来る留学生が増えました。
,私たちの大学には今アメリカ、
,日本、イギリス、フランス、ドイツ、カナダなど
,十数か国から来た留学生が
,二百五十名ぐらいいます。
,今日は大学新聞の記者をしている李さんが
,留学生にインタビューをしました。
,留学生の多くが中国へ留学しようと思ったのは
,中国の文化に興味があったからです。
,生活環境については安全だからいいと答えています。
,もちろん、
,騒音や公害などの問題があるという人もいます。
,彼らは中国へ来てからたまに
,病気になることもあります。
,そういうときには、病院へ行ったり、
,大学の医務室で手当てを受けたりします。
,留学生は中国人の友達がおおぜいいますから、
,ふだんはよく中国語を使っています。
,ですから、言葉の違いは彼らにとって
,あまり大きな問題ではありません。
,（会話）
,記者：私は大学新聞の記者で、李と申します 。
,これ、私の名刺です。
,どうぞ、よろしくお願いします。
,皆：こちらこそ。
,記者：私たちの大学には今、
,留学生が二百五十名ぐらいいて、
,十数カ国から来ています。
,今日は留学生のみなさんに

,まず、中国へ来る前に中国のことを知っていましたか。
,山田：ええ、
,中国を紹介した本をいろいろ読みましたから、
,中国のことをよく知っていました。
,ナンシー：私は中国のことを
,ぜんぜん知りませんでした。
,記者：どうして中国へ留学しようと思いましたか。
,佐藤：私は中国の文化に興味がありましたから。
,とくに北京オリンピックや
,上海万博についてのテレビ番組を見たあとで、
,中国へ留学しようと思いました。
,ジョン：私は中国へ留学すれば
,中国語が上手になるだろうと思いましたから。
,記者：生活環境をどう思いますか。
,山田：いいと思います。
,記者：どうしていいと思いますか。
,山田：安全だからです。
,記者：ピエールさんはどう思いますか。
,ピエール：私も安全でいい所だと思います。
,しかし、問題もいろいろあると思います。
,記者：たとえば？
,ピエール：大学のまわりがちょっとうるさいし、
,公害問題もあるし、
,留学生にとってあまりいい環境じゃないと思います。
,山田：でも、このあたりは大学が多いし、
,公園も近いし、留学生にとって便利だと思います。
,記者：今住んでいる寮をどう思いますか。
,ホワイト：私は非常に満足しています。
,マリー ：私はあまり満足していません。
,記者：このあたりの交通をどう思いますか。
,ホワイト：あまり便利じゃないと思います。
,記者：こちらの気候をどう思いますか。

,しかし、このごろは暑かったり、
,寒かったりで、ちょっと大変です。
,記者：みなさんは中国へ来てから
,病気になったことがありますか。
,山田：ええ。体に気をつけないと、
,病気になることがあります。
,私は一回ありました。
,ナンシー：私は二回ありました。

,ピエール：映画を見たり、
,町へ買い物に行ったりします。

,ピエール：いいえ、
,遅くまで勉強することはありますが、
,徹夜をすることはありません。
,記者：授業は全部わかりますか。
,ピエール：わかる時とわからない時があります。
,ナンシー：私もわかりやすい講義と
,わかりにくい講義があると思います。
,記者：どんな講義がわかりにくいですか。
,ナンシー：速く話す先生の講義がわかりにくいです。
,記者：講義がわからない時はどうしますか。
,ナンシー：クラスメートのノートを借りて勉強します。
,記者：教科書はどうですか。
,マリー：教科書は絵が多くてわかりやすいと思います。
,山田：私はあまりよくないと思います。
,記者：なぜよくないと思いますか。

,あまり実生活に役立たないからです。
,記者：みなさんはふだんよく中国語を使いますか。
,佐藤：ええ、中国人の友達が
,おおぜいいますからよく中国語を使います。
,記者：言葉の違いはみなさんにとって大きな問題ですか
,佐藤：いいえ、中国の方がみんな親切ですから、

,ホームステイで中国を知ろう
,留学生専用の寮で生活している外国人学生は、

,（前文）
,春節のある日、
,留学生の高橋さんが李さんの家を訪ねました。
,そして李さんの家でおいしいギョーザを食べました。
,ギョーザの作り方はそれほど難しくありません。
,小麦粉をこねて薄く伸ばした皮に、
,豚肉や野菜などを包んで、

,高橋さんが中国へ来てからもう半年たちました。
,中国へ来る前に、中国を紹介した本を読んだので、
,中国のことをすこし知っていました。
,彼は留学生活はとても楽しいと言っています。
,日曜日、
,彼は映画を見たり中国人の友達を訪ねたりします。
,今年の春節に、

,高橋さんは国へ帰りません。
,彼は友達に何かプレゼントしたいと思っています。
,そして、中国人の結婚式を見たことがまだないから、
,友達の結婚披露宴にも出席したいと思っています。
,高橋さんは自分一人で行くと寂しいと思って、
,李さんを誘ってみました。
,（会話）
,李：さあ、もうおなかがすいたでしょう。
,どうぞ食べてください。
,高橋：ああ、おいしそうですね。
,ギョーザは中国の人にとても人気がありますね。
,李：ええ。わたしの家は新上海人ですから、
,旧正月には、
,やはり北国の習慣でギョーザを食べます。
,今日は何もありませんが、
,たくさん食べてください。
,高橋：はい、じゃ、遠慮なくいただきます。
,李：どうぞ。
,高橋：ほんとうにおいしいですね。
,どうやって作るんですか。
,李：それほど難しくありません。
,小麦粉をこねて薄く伸ばした皮に
,豚肉や野菜などを包んで、
,蒸したり茹でたりすればいいのです。
,高橋：そうですか。作りやすいですね。
,李：ええ。でも、
,豚肉や野菜などを入れすぎてはいけません。
,入れすぎると、ギョーザの味がまずくなります。
,高橋：なるほど。
,それがおいしく作るこつですか。
,李：はい、そうです。それがこつです。
,ところで、
,高橋さんは中国へ来てからもう半年たちましたね。
,高橋：ええ。時のたつのは速いですね。
,李：高橋さんが中国へ来る前に中国のことを
,知っていましたか。
,高橋：ええ、中国を紹介する本を

,中国へ留学しようと思いました。
,李：そうですか。
,こちらの留学生活をどう思いますか。
,高橋：とてもいいと思います。
,李：なぜそう思いますか。

,寮のテレビの映りが悪くて困っているんです。
,李：どうしたんですか。
,高橋：電波障害ですよ。
,最近、
,まわりに新しい高層ビルがどんどん建ったんです。
,李：そうですか。
,高橋：それから、まわりの騒音問題もあるし、
,大気汚染の問題もあるし、
,留学生にとってあまりいい環境じゃないと思います。
,李：しかし、このあたりは大学も多いし、
,公園も近いし、みなさんにとって便利でしょう。
,高橋：ええ、それはそうですね。
,でも、市内までの交通はあまり便利じゃないんです。
,李：日曜日には何をしていますか。
,高橋：日曜日には映画を見たり、
,中国人の友達を訪ねたりしています。
,李：授業についてはどう思いますか。
,高橋：授業時間が日本より長いし、
,宿題も多いし、とても大変ですね。
,李：春節にはどうして日本へ帰らないんですか。
,高橋：実は春節に、
,親しい中国人の友達が結婚するんです。
,李：そうですか。それはおめでたいですね。
,高橋：中国の結婚式のやりかたは
,日本とずいぶん違うでしょうね。
,友達に何かプレゼントしたいんですが、
,どんなものがいいでしょうか。
,李：そうですね。
,何か新しい生活に役に立つものがいいでしょう。
,高橋：そのとおりですね。
,中国では、
,結婚する人に普通何をプレゼントしますか。
,李：普通、コーヒーセットや電気スタンド、
,花びんなどをプレゼントします。
,高橋：花びんがいいですね。
,その人は花が大好きですから。
,李：じゃあ、花びんをもらうと、
,きっとよろこぶでしょう。
,高橋さんは友達の結婚披露宴に出席するんですか。
,高橋：ええ、
,行かないと失礼ですから出席したいと思っています。
,李：中国人の結婚式を見たことがありますか。
,高橋：いいえ、
,中国の結婚式はまだ見たことがないんです。
,李：では、中国人の結婚式を初めて見るんですね。
,高橋：そうなんです。
,ですからとても楽しみにしています。
,李：どうぞ、ぜひ見てください。
,高橋：はい。しかし、
,友達は私が一人で行くと寂しいだろうと心配して、
,大学の友人を誘っても
,かまわないと言っているんです。
,それで李さんといっしょに
,行こうと思っているんですが、
,いかがでしょうか。
,李：それはどうもありがとうございます。
,結婚式はいつですか。
,高橋：来週の土曜日です。
,李：会場はどこですか。
,高橋：杏花楼です。
,李：いいところですね。
,じゃ、どこで待ち合わせましょうか。

,本間さんを訪ねる
,久しぶりに留学生の本間さんを訪ねました。
,訪ねる前に彼に電話をしておきました。
,留学生寮では大学の近くにあります。
,彼の部屋のベランダには植木鉢がたくさん置いてあるのですぐ分かりました。
,本間さんの部屋は二つあります。
,一つの部屋には、テーブル、椅子、戸棚などが置いてあります。
,戸棚には食器が入れてあります。
,窓にはカーテンがかけてあります。
,今、窓はしめてあります。
,天気のいい日にはこの窓から市内のテレビ塔が見えます。
,もう一つの部屋には、ベッドや本棚が置いてあります。
,本棚には本がたくさん並べてあります。
,主に中国の政治、経済、歴史の本ですが、小説も少しはいっています。
,机の上にはペンや原稿用紙がいっぱい置いてあります。
,本間さんはレポートを書いているようです私は「大丈夫かい。
,先に勉強をしたほうがいいだろう。
,今日はすぐ帰るよ」と言いましたが、
,彼は「大丈夫だ。もうほとんどできている」と言って私を引き止め、
,勉強のことや留学生活のことなどを夢中になって話しました。

,今日は春のバーゲーがあるます。
,それで、留学生の中島さんは李さんを誘って町のデパートへ買い物に来ました。
,中島さんは靴とコードを買おうと思い、李さんはカセットデッキと万年筆を買おうと思いました。
,中島さんは靴売場で、いろいろな靴をはいてみてから形の気に入ったものを買いました。
,サイズは二十六点五センチで、値段は三十二元五角でした。
,それから自分の体のサイズにぴったりで、軽くて着やすいコードを買いました。
,李さんはカセットデッキを買いました。ちょうど春のバーゲンなので、二割引の安い値段でした。
,それから、友達にプレゼントをあげようと思って、値段がやや高く、新発売でボールペンとセットになっている青色の万年筆を買いました。

,現代の食生活
,食生活は風土や生活水準、生活様式などと、深い関係があります。
,中国では、二十世紀八十年代改革開放後の経済高度成長期に入ると、
,個人の所得が著しく伸びて、どの家庭もテレビや洗濯機などを使い、
,家事の負担が軽くなりました。
,こうした所得の伸びや生活様式の変化は、
,食生活にも大きく影響し、人々の食べ物の量や質、
,そして食事についての考え方を変えました。
,たとえば、以前は米、肉、魚が中心の食事でしたが、
,現在では、パン、乳製品などが多くなりました。
,また、人々が、お茶よりコーヒー、紅茶、コーラ、 ジュースなどを好み、
,紹興酒や白酒のほかにビールやウィスキー、ワインなどを多く飲んでいます。
,とくに若者の食生活が大きく変わりました。
,コンビニエンスストアやファミリーレストラン、
,ファーストフードなど外食産業が急激に発展するとともに若者の生活の国際化が顕著になりました。
,このような急激な変化の背景には、核家族化や少子化が進んで、家族団欒で食事をする機会が減っているという原因があります。

,留学生の田中さんは日曜日に、浦東の世紀公園へ行こうと思いました。
,彼は交通係に道を尋ねて、地下鉄に乗りました。
,地下鉄では、駅員がマイクでアナウンスしたり、車内放送を流したりしますが、上海の道がまだよくわからない田中さんは乗客にいろいろ聞きました。
,乗客は親切に彼に教えました。
,留学生寮で近いから、田中さんは自転車で学校に通っていますが、通学生の徐さんは家が学校から遠いので、地下鉄を利用しています。
,ですから、朝も夕方も込 む電車に乗らなければなりません。
,それでも、徐さんはいつも電車の中で、MP3を聞きながら、日本語を熱心勉強しています。
,会話
,（地下鉄駅の近く）
,交通係：みなさん、危ないですから、車道の中を歩かないでください。
,危ないですから、車道を横切らないでください。
,道を横切る時は左と右をよく見て、横断歩道を通ってください。
,田中：すみません、ちょっと伺いますが。
,交通係：はい、何ですか。
,田中：浦東の世紀公園へ行きたいんですが、どう行ったらいいんでしょうか。
,交通係：地下鉄に乗ってください。
,田中：地下鉄の駅はどこですか。
,交通係：あそこの店の前です。ほら、いま、バスが止まった所です。
,田中：そうですか。どうもありがとうございました。
,（プラットホーム。五分して地下鉄の電車が来る。駅員がマイクでアナウンスする。）
,駅員：この電車はいちご線で、莘荘行きです。　
,危ないですから押さないでください。
,危ないですから、ひとりひとり順にお乗りください。
,お乗りの方が大勢いますから入り口には立たないでください。　
,込んできましたから、できるだけ奥に詰めてください。　
,ドアが閉まります。ご注意ください。
,（車内）
,田中：すみません、ちょっと伺いたいんですが。
,乗客：はい、何ですか。
,田中：浦東の世紀公園へ行きたいんですが、どう行ったらいいでしょうか。
,乗客：人民広場でお乗換えください。
,田中：はい、分かりました。人民広場の駅はここからいくつ目ですか。
,乗客：六つ目です。
,田中：どうもありがとうございました。
,（車内放送）
,お待たせしませた。この電車は莘荘行きです。　
,…新閘路、人民広場、黃陂南路…終点莘荘の順に停車いたします。　
,常に安全運転を心掛けておりますが、事故防止のため、止むを得ず急停車することがありますので、ご注意ください。　
,発車します。　
,揺れますからお立ちの方は釣革や手摺りにしっかりお掴まりください。
,次は人民広場です。浦東方面においでのお客様は、二号線の電車にお乗換えです。
,お降りのお客様はお忘れ物をなさいませんようお支度ください。
,ご乗車、お疲れ様ですた。
,（浦東方面の電車の車内放送）
,毎度ご利用くださいまして、誠にありがとうございます。
,上海科学館、上海科学館…
,田中：ちょっと、すみません。今の放送がよくわからなかったんですが、世紀公園はまだですか。
,駅員：あ、次ですよ。
,田中：どうもありがとうございます。
,（車内放送）
,毎度ご利用くださいまして、誠にありがとうございます。
,世紀公園前、世紀公園前…
,（プラットホーム）
,田中：すみません、世紀公園前でうすね。
,駅員：はい、そうです。
,田中：ここから世紀公園まで遠いですか。
,駅員：いいえ、それほど遠くありません。
,この道をまっすぐ言って、2つ目の角を左に曲がると、世紀公園の通りに出ます。
,田中：その角から世紀公園が見えますか。
,駅員：はい、正面に見えます。
,田中：どうもありがとうございました。
,（大学で）
,徐：田中さんはいつも留学生寮から学校までなんで通っているんですか。
,田中：近いから、たいてい自転車で通っていますが、雨の日はタクシーに乗ったりします。
,徐：それはいいですね。　通学生の私はうちから学校まで遠いですから、いつも地下鉄を利用しています。
,田中：地下鉄は朝も夕方も込んでいますか。
,徐：ええ。でも、夕方は朝ほど込んでいません。
,朝は電車が遅れてくるし、込んでいるので、とても疲れます。
,田中：ラッシュは大変でしょうね。
,徐：ええ、事故が起こった時はいくらまっても電車がなかなか来ません。
,田中：それは大変ですね。
,徐：そして、電車の中はすし詰めで、全然身動きもできなくて、ほんとうにいやです。
,田中：授業に遅れては困りますね。
,徐：そうです。ですから、このごろ、私は早めに家を出るようにしています。
,田中：電車は空いていますか。
,徐：空いてはいませんが、いくらか増しです。
,私は電車の中でMP3を聞きながら日本語を勉強していますよ。
,田中：それは感心ですね。
,徐：しかし、上海の交通問題はますます深刻になっていくでしょう。
,ほんとうに心配ですね。
,田中：悲観しないでください。
,日本のように地下鉄さえどんどん作れば交通事情もだんだんよくなっていくでしょう。

,上海の交通について
,上海市内の交通機関を利用するとき、公共交通カードを使うことが出来ます。
,読み取り機の上にカードをかざすだけで料金支払いが完了します。
,電車および地下鉄の各駅、コンビニエンスストア、マクドナルドなどで購入、チャージすることが出来ます。
,有効期限は最後のチャージから二年間です。
,カードが不要になった場合は大衆交通チケットセンターなどで返却することができます。
,カードの使用可能の範囲は地下鉄、タクシー、バスのほか、フェリーや高速道路などです。
,地下鉄の料金は距離に比例して違います。
,磁気カード式の切符を構内の券売機で購入します。購入後は改札を通って入場し、到着駅でも同様に出場します。
,タクシー会社は大衆、強生、錦江など二〇社以上あります。
,乗り方は簡単で、手をあげて車を停め、行き先を告げればいいです。
,英語の普及率がまだ低 いため外国人のお客様は地図または行き先を記してある紙を準備するほうがよいです。
,後者の際にはレシートを受け取っておくほうがよいでしょう。
,タクシー会 社名と電話番号、走行距離などが記され、トレブル時の助けとなります。
,市バスは乗車ときに運賃を支払います。
,公共交通カードを使用することができます。
,車内に車掌が乗車し、発車後に徴収する場合もあります。

,杜甫
,八月秋高风怒号，卷我屋上三重茅。
,茅飞渡江洒江郊，高者挂罥长林梢，下者飘转沉塘坳。
,南村群童欺我老无力，忍能对面为盗贼，公然抱茅入竹去。
,唇焦口燥呼不得，归来倚杖自叹息。
,俄顷风定云墨色，秋天漠漠向昏黑。
,布衾多年冷似铁，娇儿恶卧踏里裂。
,床头屋漏无干处，雨脚如麻未断绝。
,自经丧乱少睡眠，长夜沾湿何由彻?
,安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜，风雨不动安如山！
,呜呼！
,何时眼前突兀见此屋，吾庐独破受冻死亦足！

,浔阳江头夜送客， 枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
,主人下马客在船， 举酒欲饮无管弦。
,醉不成欢惨将别， 别时茫茫江浸月。
,忽闻水上琵琶声， 主人忘归客不发。
,寻声暗问弹者谁？ 琵琶声停欲语迟。
,【沈谧仁】
,移船相近邀相见， 添酒回灯重开宴。
,千呼万唤始出来， 犹抱琵琶半遮面。
,转轴拨弦三两声， 未成曲调先有情。
,弦弦掩抑声声思， 似诉平生不得志。
,低眉信手续续弹， 说尽心中无限事。
,轻拢慢捻抹复挑， 初为霓裳后六幺。
,【奇然】
,大弦嘈嘈如急雨， 小弦切切如私语。
,嘈嘈切切错杂弹， 大珠小珠落玉盘。
,【沈谧仁】
,间关莺语花底滑， 幽咽泉流冰下难。
,冰泉冷涩弦凝绝， 凝绝不通声暂歇。
,别有幽愁暗恨生， 此时无声胜有声。
,银瓶乍破水浆迸， 铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
,曲终收拨当心画， 四弦一声如裂帛。
,东船西舫悄无言， 唯见江心秋月白。
,（念白）
,沉吟放拨插弦中， 整顿衣裳起敛容。
,自言本是京城女， 家在虾蟆陵下住。
,十三学得琵琶成， 名属教坊第一部。
,曲罢曾教善才服， 妆成每被秋娘妒。
,【奇然】
,五陵年少争缠头， 一曲红绡不知数。
,钿头银篦击节碎， 血色罗裙翻酒污。
,【沈谧仁】
,今年欢笑复明年， 秋月春风等闲度。
,弟走从军阿姨死， 暮去朝来颜色故。
,【奇然】
,门前冷落鞍马稀， 老大嫁作商人妇。
,商人重利轻别离， 前月浮梁买茶去。
,【合】
,去来江口守空船， 绕船月明江水寒。
,夜深忽梦少年事， 梦啼妆泪红阑干。
,【奇然】
,我闻琵琶已叹息， 又闻此语重唧唧。
,同是天涯沦落人， 相逢何必曾相识！
,我从去年辞帝京， 谪居卧病浔阳城。
,浔阳地僻无音乐， 终岁不闻丝竹声。
,住近湓江地低湿， 黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
,其间旦暮闻何物？ 杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
,【沈谧仁】
,春江花朝秋月夜， 往往取酒还独倾。
,岂无山歌与村笛？ 呕哑嘲哳难为听。
,今夜闻君琵琶语， 如听仙乐耳暂明。
,【合】
,莫辞更坐弹一曲， 为君翻作《琵琶行》。
,感我此言良久立， 却坐促弦弦转急。
,凄凄不似向前声， 满座重闻皆掩泣。
,座中泣下谁最多？ 江州司马青衫湿。

,圣人之所以为圣，
,愚人之所以为愚，

,爱其子， 择师而教之；
,于其身也， 则耻师焉， 惑矣。

,The sound of silence
,Simon & Garfunkel
,
,Hello darkness my old friend.
,I've come to talk with U again.
,Because a vision softly creeping.
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
,And the vision that was planted in my brain.
,Still remains.
,Within the sound of silence
,
,In restless dreams I walk alone.
,Narrow streets of cobble stone.
,'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
,I turned my collar to the cold & damp.
,When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light.
,That split the night.
,And touched the sound of silence.
,
,And in the naked night I saw.
,Ten thousand people maybe more.
,People talking without speaking.
,People hearing without listening.
,People writing songs that voices never share.
,And no one dare.
,Disturb the sound of silence
,"Fool" said I "U do not know.
,"Silence like a cancer grows.
,Hear my words that I might teach U.
,"Take my arms that I might reach U.
,But my words like silent rain-drops fell
,
,And echoed in the wells of silence
,
,And the people bow & prayed.
,To the neon God they made.
,And the sign flash out its warning.
,In the words that it was forming
,And the sign said "The words of the prophers.
,Are written the subway walls & tenement halls".
,And whispered in the sounds of silence.

,He deals the cards as a meditation
,And those he plays never suspect
,He doesn't play for the money he wins
,He doesn't play for respect
,He deals the cards to find the answer
,The sacred geometery of chance
,The hidden law of a probable outcome
,The numbers lead a dance
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,He may play the jack of diamonds
,He may lay the queen of spades
,He may conseal a king in his hand
,While the memory of it fades
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,But that's not the shape,shape of my heart
,And if i told you that i loved you
,You'd maybe think there's something wrong
,I'm not a man of too many faces
,The mask i wear is one
,Those who speak know nothing
,And find out to their cost
,Like those who curse their luck in too many places
,Are those who fear a lost
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art

,I’m a little used to calling outside your name
,I won't see you tonight so I can keep from going insane
,But I don't know enough, I get some kind of lazy day
,I've been fabulous through to find my tattered name
,I'll be stewed tomorrow if I don't leave us both the same
,But I don't know enough, I get some kind of lazy day
,Cause It's hard for me to lose in my life I've found
,Only time will tell and I will figure out
,That we can baby, we can do the one night stand
,And it's hard for me to lose in my life I've found
,Outside your skin right near the fire
,That we can baby we can change and feel alright
,I'm a little used to wandering outside the rain
,You could leave me tomorrow if it suits you just the same
,But I don't know enough, I need sun when it leaves the day

,Leave the light on, dear
,Sweep the front porch in case I'm strong enough to call again
,It won't be tomorrow, dear
,Or the next day when I can accept that we're just friends
,If heartbreak was a crime, you'd be locked up
,And I'd gladly throw away the key
,I need some time to let my wounds heal up
,Some time to the let the girl I love leave my dreams
,Just give my poor heart ease
,I'm begging please, please, please
,Just give my poor heart ease
,I'm begging please, please, please
,Don't you dare doubt me
,
,Cause let me hate the fact
,That you mean more to me than I to you
,That, there is no doubt
,What a fool to think that we could be
,Friends and lovers together, happily

,Love you've walked on glass for
,If the clock is right or if it's wrong
,I will lose mine if you lose yours
,Until
,Until
,Catching rain in your hat
,Grass as high as my head
,And the light is caught up in your beard
,Like my fingers wandering to rest in it
,Until
,Until
,Make believe, play along
,That we're not in love
,I will lie for my love
,I'll forget later on
,This is what I look like today
,And I'm trying not to pull out my hair
,I'm trying how to grow it but I'm far too shy to show it back there
,That is probably why I like wearing hats
,There's no denying I'm deferring the facts
,Avoiding confrontation
,Lacks tact in a situation
,Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn
,But if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming
,And oh, it goes to show
,I've so much to know
,I wrote this for my prettiest friend
,But while trying not to prove that I care
,I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away
,She can't see she's making me crazy now
,I don't believe she knows she's amazing how
,She has me holding my breathe
,So I'd never guess that I'm a none such unsuitable, suited for her
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentery
,And oh, it goes to show
,The moral of the story is boy loves girl
,And so on but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told
,I know that I should be brave
,Even pretty can be seen by the blind
,I know that I cannot wait
,Until the day we finally learn how to find each other
,Redefining open minds
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed
,And it's golden, it goes to show then
,The ending of this song should be left alone
,And so on 'cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told

,I was a little girl alone in my little world
,who dreamed of a little home for me.
,I played pretend between the trees,
,and fed my houseguests bark and leaves,
,and laughed in my pretty bed of green.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest swing.
,I had a dream.
,
,Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park,
,I asked God who I'm supposed to be.
,The stars smiled down on me,
,God answered in silent reverie.
,I said a prayer and fell asleep.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest tree.
,I had a dream.
,
,oh~
,Now I'm old and feeling grey.
,I don't know what's left to say about this life
,I'm willing to leave.
,I lived it full and I lived it well,
,there's many tales I've lived to tell.
,I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
,I'm ready now to fly from the highest wing.
,I had a dream.
,Say something, I'm giving up on you.
,
,I'll be the one, if you want me to.
,
,Anywhere I would've followed you.
,
,Say something, I'm giving up on you.
,
,And I am feeling so small.
,
,It was over my head
,
,I know nothing at all.
,
,And I will stumble and fall.
,
,I'm still learning to love
,
,Just starting to crawl.
,
,Say something, I'm giving up on you.
,
,I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
,
,Anywhere I would've followed you.
,
,Say something, I'm giving up on you.
,
,And I will swallow my pride.
,
,You're the one that I love
,
,And I'm saying goodbye.
,
,Say something, I'm giving up on you.

,My lover's got humor
,He's the giggle at a funeral
,Knows everybody's disapproval
,I should've worshiped her sooner
,If the heavens ever did speak
,He's the last true mouth piece
,Every sunday's getting more bleak
,A fresh poison each week
,We were born sick you heard them say it
,My church offers no absolutes
,He tells me worship in the bedroom
,The only heaven i'll be sent to
,Is when i'm alone with you
,I was born sick but i love it
,Command me to be well
,A-amen amen amen
,Take me to church
,I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your life
,I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

,If i'm a pagan of the good times
,My lover's the sunlight
,To keep the goddess on my side
,She demands a sacrifice
,To drain the whole sea
,Get something shiny
,Something meaty for the main course
,That's a fine looking high horse
,What you got in the stable
,We've a lot of starving faithful “
,That looks tasty
,That looks plenty
,This is hungry work
,Take me to church
,I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

,Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
,Telling me just what a fool I've been
,I wish that it would go

,and let me be alone again

,Looking for a brand new start
,Little does she know
,that when she left that day
,along with her she took my heart
,Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
,for her to steal my heart away when she doesn't care
,I can't love another
,When my heart's somewhere far away
,Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain

,Looking for a brand new start

,Please ask the sun to set her heart a glow
,Rain in her heart
,and let the love we knew start to grow

,I haven't seen them in a while
,You've been good, busier than ever
,Small talk, work and the weather

,is still burned in the back of your mind
,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
,Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December turn around and make it all right
,I go back to December all the time
,
,These days I haven't been sleepin
,Stayin up playing back myself leavin
,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
,Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
,I watched you laughin from the passenger side
,And realized I loved you in the fall
,And then the cold came the dark days
,when fear crept into my mind
,You gave me all your lovin all I gave you was goodbye
,
,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in
,front of you saying I'm sorry for that night

,I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
,So good to me so right
,And how you held me in your arms that September night
,
,The first time you ever saw me cry
,Maybe this is wishful thinkin
,Probably mindless dreamin
,If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
,I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
,So if the chain is on your door I understand

,When i was young i'd listen to the radio
,waiting for my favorite songs
,When they played i'd sing along,
,it made me smile.
,Those were such happy times and not so long ago
,how i wondered where they'd gone.
,But they're back again just like a long lost friend
,all the songs i love so well.
,Every shalala every wo'wo
,still shines.
,Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
,that they're starting
,to sing so fine
,When they get to the part
,Where he's breaking her heart
,It can really make me cry
,just like before.
,It's yesterday once more.
,(shoobie do lang lang)
,Looking back on how it was in years gone by
,and the good times that I had
,makes today seem rather sad,

,It was songs of love that i would sing to them
,and i'd memorise each word.
,Those old melodies still sound so good to me
,as they melt the years away
,every shalala every wo'wo still shines

,Starry, starry night
,paint your palette blue and grey
,look out on a summer's day
,with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
,Shadows on the hills
,sketch the trees and the daffodils
,catch the breeze and the winter chills
,in colors on the snowy linen land.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,Starry starry night
,flaming flowers that brightly blaze
,swirling clouds in violet haze
,reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
,Colors changing hue
,morning fields of amber grain
,weathered faces lined in pain
,are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,For they could not love you
,but still your love was true
,and when no hope was left in sight on that
,starry starry night.
,You took your life as lovers often do,
,But I could have told you Vincent
,this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
,Starry starry night
,portraits hung in empty halls
,frameless heads on nameless walls
,with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
,Like the stranger that you've met
,the ragged men in ragged clothes
,the silver thorn of bloddy rose
,lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
,And now I think I know
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they're not listening still
,perhaps they never will.

,I'm a grown ass man this is maturity
,Swinging as I'm clinging to my idol
,For security
,For you to notice me
,Beauty in the eye of the beholder
,What the solider see
,There's beauty in the trouble
,Cause' the trouble gives you character
,You fightin' mother nature
,But you lack the strength to challenge
,You might as well get on her good side
,And empower her
,Plant flowers, raise a family
,Shower her with gifts
,Shout
,Your love from a tower
,And let the world hear
,Give her your vision for the future
,Like the world's fair
,
,Stop tryna live like
,The world's fair
,Learn how to listen and be the world's ear Yeah

一个家
婆婆爷爷姐妹亲戚和爸妈
像国家
有参天大树也有青草鲜花
不管你从大到小
或从小到大
都各有各的酸甜苦咸辣
爱的家
欢声笑语从不畏风吹雨打
爱的国
天寒地冻大浪淘沙也不怕
不管你是大是小
或是小是大
都愿高树挺拔山河融洽
小梦想
星星光
大梦想
像太阳
都在我们的心里闪闪亮
你有梦
我有梦
红黄蓝各种各样
但他们的温暖却都一样
爱是他一生不变的牵挂
爱是她温柔呵护的小家
一天天一年年
一滴滴一点点
困难最后变成脸上
甜美的笑颜
青菜萝卜还有豆腐干
其实生活原本就没有那么难
相视地一笑
或是轻轻把手牵
所有的爱意都变成了习惯
一个家
叔叔伯伯兄弟邻居和娃娃
像国家
有参天大树也有青草鲜花
不管你从大到小
或从小到大
都各有各的苦衷和牵挂
爱的家
欢声笑语从不畏风吹雨打
爱的国
天寒地冻大浪淘沙也不怕
不管你是大是小
或是小是大
都愿高树挺拔山河融洽
小梦想
星星光
大梦想
像太阳
梦和梦没有最小和最大
你有梦
我有梦
梦是路途的礼花
有梦的人是生活的作家
小梦想
星星光
大梦想
像太阳
都在我们的心里闪闪亮
你有梦
我有梦
红黄蓝各种各样
谁的心里没有一个剧场
有梦的人都更容易飞翔

容我沉溺片刻好止渴

也似英雄做军人梦
看侦探小说 能否辩清好恶

会问我该冠以怎样的美名
来搭配世人对你的万千期许
我只好沉默 仅被赞扬的 那不是你

世事良善或复杂请你也天真
怎忍妖魔侵害你的一腔赤诚

避开愤黑的指责
你一直沉默 用行动证明着
你会活的比谁都磊落

坦然接受所有艳羡或妒火
请你稍微歇会儿 脚步更深刻
我们的征程 从不仅仅是星辰大海

也造内心剔透的冰雪王国

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,Everybody loves the things you do
,From the way you talk
,To the way you move
,Everybody here is watching you
,Cause you feel like home?
,You're like a dream come true
,But if by chance you're here alone
,Can I have a moment
,Before I go?
,Cause I've been by myself all night long
,Hoping you're someone I used to know?
,You look like a movie
,You sound like a song
,My God, this reminds me
,Of when we were young
,Let me photograph you in this light
,In case it is the last time
,That we might be exactly like we were
,Before we realized
,We were sad of getting old
,It made us restless
,It was just like a movie
,It was just like a song
,I was so scared to face my fears
,Nobody told me that you'd be here
,And I swear you moved overseas
,That's what you said
,When you left me
,You still look like a movie
,You still sound like a song

,When we were young
,When we were young
,When we were young
,When we were young
,It's hard to admit that
,Everything just takes me back
,To when you were there
,To when you were there
,And a part of me keeps holding on
,Just in case it hasn't gone
,I guess I still care
,Do you still care?
,It was just like a movie
,It was just like a song
,My God, this reminds me
,Of when we were young

,Let me photograph you in this light
,In case it is the last time
,That we might be exactly like we were

,Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
,It makes me reckless

When the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry, tall chimneys become campanili. The warehouses are palaces in the night. And the whole city hangs in the heavens and fairyland is before us. American painter James McNeil Whistler faced tough criticism for these near abstract night-time images. But, like so many artists, his picture of 19th-century London was of a city cloaked and impenetrable.


夜幕降临 薄雾给河岸带来一丝诗情画意，高耸的烟囱在夜晚化身成了钟楼。仓库也俨然宫殿一般。画中呈现的城市，犹如沉醉在仙境中。美国画家詹姆斯·麦克奈尔·惠斯勒因其所绘的抽象夜景而饱受争议，但恰如其他艺术家一样，他所创作的19世纪伦敦是座若隐若现神秘莫测的城市。 *迷雾漫漫伦敦天* *A foggy day in London town* *令我心忧令我愁* *Had me low and it had me down* *一早双眸蒙戒意* *I view the morning with much alarm* *往日大英博物馆* *The British Museum* *褪去魅力与荣光* *It lost its charm*
,At the end of the 18th century,
,poet and visionary William Blake,
,prophesied a city where awfulness and wonder become the same thing.
,Industrialisation, the machine age and the railways
,would transform the look and the experience of the city.
,No more the beautiful neo-classical Georgian city,
,London was to become a huge sprawling metropolis.
,1 million inhabitants in 1800
,would become six and a half million a century later.
,Now the truest pictures of London
,would find beauty and inspiration in the most horrific qualities of the city.
,This immense view of the sprawling metropolis
,was billed as an illusionistic scene designed to thrill and excite.
,
,Painter William Hogarth rejected artifice to create a new picture of London.
,In a series of paintings from 1736 entitled Four Times Of The Day,
,Hogarth paints London as a divided city, where high society rubbed shoulders with London's chaotic grimy truths.
,It begins on a freezing morning in Covent Garden.
,An affluent lady makes her way to church past drunken revellers staggering home from the night before.
,She is oblivious to the huddle of beggars and whores warming themselves by the fire.
,At noon, the notorious slum district of St Giles is a divided world.
,On the left, a group of fashionable Huguenot immigrants pour out of the French church.
,On the other side of the street are a group of well fed but slovenly English peasants.
,The only thing that connects these two worlds is a dead cat that lies across the kerb.
,
Throughout history, many have tried to impose beauty and order on London's streets. But this city has discovered time after time. Its true character lies in its unplanned, chaotic nature. London has burned many times across the centuries.


Tim Snow：如果你仔细观察古老伦敦的街道，特别是中心城区的街道，仍然可以看到以前的巷子和曲折杂乱的小街区。这只是多年的城市规划叠加在一起的结果，伦敦的主体结构早已形成，从而更能让我体会到这种渐变的过程。大体构架还清晰可见，我想可能永远也无法抹去。每一代人都试图在这座城中盖上自己的标记。 纵观历史，许多人都曾尝试维护伦敦街道的美观与有序。这座城市一次又一次证明了它的个性始终深埋在桀骜不羁的天性中。几个世纪以来，伦敦多次被大火烧毁。
The imprint of ancient London defines the map of the modern city. The city sheds its skin while the bones stay the same. During the 17th and 18th centuries, new streets and houses spread west. Beyond the old city, a very different London was emerging.


老伦敦身上不可磨灭的印记，决定了现代伦敦的布局，就像老瓶装新酒一般的道理。 Bank junction is like... 银行交叉口就像 It's the pulse of London. It's the heartbeat of London. 就像是伦敦的脉搏 伦敦的心跳 You've got the Royal Exchange right in front of you, 正对面是伦敦交易所 you've got the Bank of England itself on the left, 左边就是英格兰银行 and there's so much going on there. 这里发生着很多故事 There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. 这一幕背后有着很多故事 You just don't actually see it, 只是你看不见而已 but you can virtually feel it going on there. 但你就是有这种感觉 You can envisage the old Roman legions, I suppose, 你可以想象古罗马的庞大军团 crossing the junction there 穿过这里的情形 because initially it was the old Roman part of London. 因为这是伦敦最具有古罗马气息的地方 Time just sort of stands still while you're there. 身临此处 时间仿佛静止了一般 If you could sort of half shut your eyes, 当你半睁双眼 you can see the old traders. 还可以看到那些老道的交易员 You know, they're going to Lloyd's of London 匆匆地赶往劳埃德保险社 or little coffee houses in the back streets that are still there. 或者保存至今的后街小咖啡馆 And you can see behind the windows of all the buildings there 透过那些大楼的窗户可以看到 the clerks with quill pens buzzing away, making lists and charts, 员工们正用羽毛笔奋笔疾书 制作表单 just generally getting on with the business of London. 为一些活计而忙碌着 It's the pulse. It's the heartbeat of London, 这样一个小小的地方 virtually in that little area there. 就是伦敦的脉搏 伦敦的心脏 在17到18世纪期间，新街区与住宅区开始向西延伸。抛开旧城，一个新的伦敦正在形成。

,An American government panel has recommended that pregnant women,
,health-care workers, children and young adults up to the age of 24
,should get priority for the swine flu vaccine released later this year.
,But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
,conceded the policy may change
,
,Doctor Ann Schuchat of the Center for Disease Control
,said the pregnant women were particularly vulnerable.
,It is vital for pregnant women
,who have respiratory illness and fever to get early treatment.
,We think antiviral medicines for them can be lifesaving,
,and that's a very important message.
,We also think it is important for them to get seasonal influenza vaccine,
,and today the committee recommended that when vaccine is available,
,and we have a decision to go forward
,that the pregnant women really out of consider getting the H1N1 vaccine.

,Doctor Margaret Chan was speaking at a global forum in Mexico

,Andy Gallacher reports.
,The head of the World Health Organization
,was keen to promote Mexico as a safe destination
,despite its suffering the largest number of fatality
,since the outbreak began over two months ago.
,Leaders and experts from across the world here in Cancun

,but the advice is still the same.
,The best way to avoid catching the virus is simple:
,wash your hands and avoid coughing
,and sneezing in public.

,President Zuma said he was revealing his HIV status to promote openness,
,and to eradicate the silence and stigma
,that accompanies the AIDS epidemic.
,He told a crowd at a hospital near Johannesburg
,that he'd now had four tests - all negative.
,Mr. Zuma's sex life has been the focus
,of intense scrutiny and criticism in South Africa.
,He has three wives and has also admitted
,to having unprotected sex with other women.
,But if his private life is controversial,
,his public stance on AIDS has been broadly welcomed here.
,His predecessor, Thabo Mbeki,
,questioned mainstream AIDS science,
,and delayed the provision of life-saving drugs.
,Mr. Zuma, in contrast,
,is taking a much more proactive role.
,The campaign he's now backing hopes
,to get 15 million people tested over the next year,
,and provide drugs to 80% of those needing them.
,South Africa is the worst affected country in the world.
,According to UN figures,
,almost one in eight people are HIV positive.

,On the second day of a major offensive against the Taliban
,in the southern Afghan province of Helmand,
,NATO-led forces have killed 12 civilians by mistake.
,A NATO statement said two rockets
,veered off target.
,Martin Patience reports.
,According to military officials,
,the two rockets were supposed to target insurgents
,who they say were firing from a compound.
,But the weapons missed their target by 300 meters,
,killing the civilians in Marjah.
,In a statement, NATO-led forces say
,they've suspended the use of this particular rocket
,while they investigate.
,Despite the deaths, commanders say
,the operation is proceeding as planned.
,Progress, however, has been slow in Marjah town
,as forces clear homemade bombs
,and booby traps from roads and compounds.

,A coup attempt appears to be under way in Niger.
,Soldiers have forced their way into the presidential palace
,and taken the head of state Mamadou Tandja
,to a military barracks.
,Johnny Hawk reports.
,Latest information says President Tandja
,has now been separated from his ministers
,and taken to an unknown military camp.
,French diplomats have confirmed
,that he's indeed in the hands
,of a mutant faction of the army
,after soldiers stormed the presidential offices
,where cabinet meeting was under way.
,The heavy exchanges of fire
,which broke out on Thursday afternoon
,have left at least 3 people dead and 10 injured.
,Exactly which part of the military carried out
,the operation remains unclear.
,Niger has been rocked by months
,of political crisis after the president changed
,the constitution to remain in power.

,Cuba has accused President Obama of not doing enough
,to end the US trade embargo against the island
,despite his promises to improve ties.
,Mr. Obama has reopened a dialogue
,with Havana a little earlier this week.
,He said it was in America's national interest
,to extend the 47-year-old embargo for another year.
,In the first official Cuban reaction
,to the decision, the Foreign Minister said
,US sanctions should be lifted without conditions.

,As forecasters say that

,up to half of all flights across Europe
,could operate on Monday.
,The European Transport Commissioner
, and Spanish minister for Europe
,were speaking after talks with the air traffic agency, Eurocontrol.
,Warren Bull reports.
,After adopting a cautious approach up till now,
,the airline industry has increasingly pushed
,the European authorities to end the flight restrictions
,which have caused travel chaos in Europe and beyond.
,Several airlines, including KLM and Lufthansa,
,have expressed anger that the decision
,to ground flights appears to have been taken solely
,on the basis of the computer simulation.
,They say they've carried out their own test flights
,and reported no problems.
,Conscious of a need to show strong leadership
,over the air travel crisis,
,European Union transport ministers are expected
,to hold an emergency video conference on Monday.

,Officials in the Philippines say
,at least a hundred people have died in floods
,and landslides in the north triggered by a week of heavy rain.
,This follows two storms in the past two weeks
,which have already left about three hundred people dead.
,Reports said that even some evacuation centers
,had been flooded. Danny Vincent reports from the capital Manila.
,Officials say that
,30 cities were hit by the landslide through the night
,where residents taken to the rooftops of their houses for refuge.
,The northern Philippines have been pounded
,by heavy rain following the second typhoon
,in just over a week to hit the nation.

,The Prime Minister of Samoa says
,77 people were killed
,and 150 injured by a tsunami in the South Pacific.
,At least 24 people died on American Samoa.
,Thousands of people's homes have been destroyed
,and the final number of deaths is expected to be higher
,as Phil Mercer reports from Sydney.
,A brutal act of nature has shattered parts of Samoa
,and neighboring American Samoa.
,The rescue effort is continuing
,with pledges of international support led by the United States.
,The number of dead has slowly increased
,since the tsunami struck after dawn
,and there are fears it will keep on rising
,as emergency teams reach isolated areas.
,Foreign tourists including a British toddler
,and a 6-year-old Australian girl are among the deads.
,Officials believe that
,many of the victims were washed out to sea
,as their homes were destroyed by waves
,reportedly up to 11 meters high.

,The latest attack, on an Evangelical Christian church,
,caused limited physical damage -
,just a burned door and a charred entranceway.
,But the political implications may be more serious.
,Tensions have flared after Malaysia's High Court
,ruled that a Roman Catholic newspaper,
,the Herald, was permitted to use the word "Allah"
,to describe God in its Malay language editions.
,Muslim groups argue that
,Christians using a word so closely associated with Islam
,could be a ploy to win converts.
,Christians make up around 9%
,of the population in the majority Muslim state.
,Most non-Muslims are ethnically Indian or Chinese.
,The row over the use of the word "Allah"
,has exposed deep resentments
,over the treatment of minorities
,and freedom of religion in Malaysia.
,A government minister told foreign diplomats on Monday
,the church attacks were the work of extremists.
,"These were not just attacks on houses of worship" he said,
,"these were attacks on the values
,and freedoms all Malaysians share."
,Under the slogan "One Malaysia",
,the government has made racial harmony a central policy.
,Its commitment to that policy
,is now being severely tested.

,Pope Benedict's personal preacher
,has compared criticism of the Pope
,over the way the Church has dealt with sex abuse allegations
,to what he called the "collective violence" suffered by the Jews.
,In his Good Friday sermon in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome,
,Father Raniero Cantalamessa
,quoted from a letter from his Jewish friend
,who had said the accusations reminded him
,of the "most shameful aspects of anti-Semitism".
,Here is our Rome correspondent Duncan Kennedy.
,The comments were made in the presence
,of Pope Benedict by one of his inner circle.
,Whether the Pope knew about it in advance?
,"We don't know. We don't know this sort of things".
,Hard to imagine that
,it wasn't raised beforehand with Pope Benedict
,that these comments were going to be coming
,and expressed the kind of opinion
,that many, many of his inner circle,
,many, many of his supporters
,believe that the Pope is getting a hard time
,because of all this allegation
,and scandal about priestly sexual abuse.
,But in no way in their view
,is Pope Benedict involved what they say
,is that he was not part of the cover-up;
,he was part of the clean-up in all of this.

,As leaders from nearly 50 countries meet
,in Washington for a major summit on Nuclear Security,
,Ukraine has pledged to eliminate stockpile
,of highly enriched uranium by 2012.
,Ukraine will also convert several nuclear research facilities
,to use low enriched uranium.
,The summit, the biggest international meeting
,hosted by the US since 1945,
,has been called by president Obama.
,Our diplomatic correspondent
,Jonathan Marcus reports from Washington.
,The timing may have been choreographed
,for the decision by the Ukraine authorities
,is just the sort of news president Barack Obama wants to hear.
,This summit is all about securing stocks of fissile material,
,highly enriched uranium and plutonium
,could potentially be used by terrorists
,to build a nuclear bomb.
,US officials said that Ukraine has sufficient highly enriched uranium
,for several nuclear weapons.
,This will be removed
,with some help from the United States.
,This is a precedent Obama
,would like other countries to follow
,and just to underscore the gravity of the potential threat.
,John Briton, a senior US counter-terrorism official,
,has warned that al-Qaeda
,has been seeking material
,for a nuclear bomb
,for over 15 years
,and that interest remains strong.

,The sound of gun shots and explosions
,echoed through the centre of Srinagar
,after gunmen opened fire in Lal Chowk,
,the main square in the city's commercial district.
,After a relatively quiet period in Kashmir,
,there have been several recent attacks -
,four soldiers were killed in an ambush
,by militants last week.
,But this latest attack is even more audacious,
,right in the heart of
,one of the most heavily policed cities in the world.
,Violent separatist groups,
,some of them backed by Pakistan,
,have taken up arms against Indian rule
,in Kashmir for 20 years.
,The fighting is far less intense
,than it was in the 1990s,
,but a political solution to Kashmir's problems remains elusive.
,So it's been a bloody start to the New Year
,in this highly sensitive region,
,which has been divided between India
,and Pakistan for decades.
,In another sign of the complexity of the conflict,
,four Pakistani soldiers have been killed
,by a suicide bomber
,in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
,It's a worrying development
,for the Pakistani authorities,
,which suggests that Taliban militants
,may be trying to expand their area of operations.

,NATO troops in Afghanistan
,have rescued a reporter
,of the New York Times newspaper
,who had been held by the Taliban
,in the northern province of Kunduz since Saturday.
,The New York Times said the journalist Stephen Farrell
,was unharmed after being released in the gun battle.
,Chris Morris reports from Kabul.
,A military operation led
,by NATO forces rescued Stephen Farrell from a village
,in the northern province of Kunduz
,where he had been kidnapped last week
,while reporting on the aftermath of a NATO airstrike.
,In remarks quoted on the New York Times website
,he says he heard British and Afghan voices
,as bullets started flying around.
,That suggests that British troops were involved
,in the rescue
,although there has been no confirmation of that.
,Stephen Farrell's colleague Sultan Munadi,
,an Afghan interpreter
,who's worked for the New York Times
,for several years
,was killed in the exchange of fire.

,A day of commemorations will begin in Poland
,shortly to mark the 70th anniversary
,of the outbreak of the 2nd World War.
,The first ceremony will take place at dawn
,on the Westerplatte peninsula near Gdansk.
,Greg Morsbach reports.
,70 years ago to the day,
,the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein
,opened fire on a Polish military
,outpost in the Baltic peninsula.
,This heralded the start of the Second World War,
,a conflict that claimed more than 50 million lives.
,70 years old leaders and top officials from nations
,such as Germany, Italy, Ukraine, France, the U.S.,
,Russia and Poland are reattending a series of ceremonies
,on the Polish coast.
,Moscow is sending a top-level delegation

,Research has revealed that
,35,000,000 people around the world
,are suffering from the brain destroying illness dementia,
,about truth of much higher figure than previously estimated,
,about two third of suffering living in the developing countries
,where people are now living longer enough to face the illness.
,One of the researchers Dr. Robert Stewart says
,it's important that people caring for those
,with dementia are supported properly.
,Most of the countries in the world
,now have outside charities that support care-gavers,
,and one of the key things
,they have to certify against in the early stages,
,is the outcome of diseases is not a natural part of aging,
,it is a disorder yet increased with ages,
,but it is not the same of all the age.

,There's more evidence that vegetarians
,are less likely the meat-eaters to develop cancer.
,The study of more than 60,000 people
,in the British Journal of Cancer suggests
,they have a lower risk of getting cancers of the stomach,
,bladder and blood.
,Adam Brimelow reports.
,The life-time risk of developing cancer
,in the general population in the UK
,is about one in three or 33%.
,This study suggests among vegetarians
,it's significantly lower, 29%.
,There's already evidence that
,eating a lot of red and processed meat
,can raise the risk of stomach cancer.
,But the reduced rate of blood cancers
,among vegetarians including leukemia,
,multiple myeloma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
,was a surprise.
,The authors say more research is needed
,to back up their findings
,and to try to explain these differences.

,
,An international team of doctors and scientists
,is calling for more focus on the causes of death
,among young people around the world,
,age between 10 and 24,
,saying the issue is largely ignored by policy makers.
,A study published in the medical journal
,the Lancet found that
,40% of adolescent deaths are caused by various forms of injury.
,Jill McGivering reports.
,Until this research was published
,there were little data on how many young people die
,worldwide in which countries and for what reasons.
,Now a pattern is emerging.
,The study suggests the death rate
,is strongly linked to how poor a country is.
,Most deaths are in the developing world
,driven by high rate of infectious disease
,and of maternal mortality.
,But globally 40% of adolescent deaths
,are caused by types of injury
,including road traffic accident, suicide and violent attacks.

,我常常回想
,记忆中的星光
,是远方碰不到
,越深越闪亮
,她有时模糊
,我也会迷惘
,闭上眼睛的时候
,怕呼吸不够长
,却从未停止
,对她的眺望
,就算看不到终点
,也不曾返航
,你在眼前挥手
,你在耳边鼓掌
,在追寻的旅途中
,我们就是光
,你在听吗
,我莽撞的故事
,和你的一样
,我们一样
,不顾一切奔跑
,不在乎受伤
,看繁星散落在头顶
,落在背着的行囊
,连雨水打在身上
,也会化成我们的衣裳
,我在发声
,喊出骄傲坚持
,不甘心流浪
,梦在发生
,闪烁在你眼眸
,和我的歌唱
,这一路遥远漫长
,多幸运你在身旁
,像一群勇敢少年
,互相温暖
,奔向光芒

,走过了懵懂的似水年华
,
,青春仿佛那风中飞舞的落花
,就这样不经意枯萎了
,
,我们迈着整齐的步伐
,我们遗忘美丽的童话
,我们开始迎接风吹雨打
,我们唱着忧伤的歌谣
,我们等待心中的她
,我们的心已远在天涯

,感觉茫然失去了方向
,脚步已缓慢　四处是黑暗
,如果梦想只是种假象
,心为何不甘　想战胜困难
,我想找　命运的轮盘用我的双手运转
,我相信　灵魂不肯投降就看得见希望
,黑夜里的太阳
,不安像重担无力抵挡
,我大声呐喊　渴望有力量
,我相信　黑暗的反面就是希望的曙光
,夜里的太阳
,Sunrise in the dark

,Every night in my dreams
,I see you
,I feel you
,That is how I know you go on
,Far across the distance
,And spaces between us.
,You have come to show you go on
,Near far,
,wherever you are
,I believe that the heart does go on
,Once more,
,you open the door,
,And you've been in my heart,
,And my heart will go on and on
,Love can touch us one time.
,And last for a lifetime
,And never let go till we're gone,
,Love was when I loved you
,One true time I hold to.
,In my life we'll always go on.
,Near far,
,wherever you are
,I believe that the heart does go on
,Once more,

,You're here,
,there's nothing I fear.
,And I know that my heart will go on
,we'll stay forever this way.
,You are safe in my heart,

苔枝綴玉，有翠禽小小，枝上同宿。客裏相逢，籬角黃昏，無言自倚修竹。昭君不慣胡沙遠，但暗憶、江南江北。想佩環、月夜歸來，化作此花幽獨。 
猶記深宮舊事，那人正睡裏，飛近蛾綠。莫似春風，不管盈盈，早與安排金屋。還教壹片隨波去，又卻怨、玉龍哀曲。等恁時、重覓幽香，已入小窗橫幅。

鹧鸪天▪重过阊门万事非

重过阊门万事非，
同来何事不同归？
梧桐半死清霜后，
头白鸳鸯失伴飞。
原上草，露初晞。
旧栖新垅两依依。
空床卧听南窗雨，
谁复挑灯夜补衣？
（宋祁）
画毂雕鞍狭路逢，
一声肠断绣帘中。
身无彩凤双飞翼，
心有灵犀一点通。

金作屋，玉为笼，
车如流水马如龙。
刘郎已恨蓬山远，
更隔蓬山几万重。

（秦观）
枝上流莺和泪闻，
新啼痕间旧啼痕。
一春鱼鸟无消息，
千里关山劳梦魂。

无一语，对芳尊。
安排肠断到黄昏。
甫能炙得灯儿了，
雨打梨花深闭门。

（聂胜琼）
玉惨花愁出凤城，
莲花楼下柳青青。
尊前一唱阳关曲，
别个人人第五程。

寻好梦，梦难成。
有谁知我此时情，
枕前泪共阶前雨，
隔个窗儿滴到明。

（晏几道）
彩袖殷勤捧玉钟，
当年拚却醉颜红。
舞低杨柳楼心月，
歌尽桃花扇底风。

从别后，忆相逢，
几回魂梦与君同。
今宵剩把银釭照，
犹恐相逢是梦中。

,この頃 涙脆くなった母が
,庭先でひとつ咳をする
,縁侧でアルバムを開いては
,私の幼い日の思い出を
,何度も同じ话くりかえす
,独言みたいに小さな声で
,こんな小春日和の穏やかな日は
,あなたの優しさが浸みて来る
,明日嫁ぐ私に苦労はしても
,笑い话に时が変えるよ
,心配いらないと笑った
,あれこれと思い出をたどったら
,いつの日もひとりではなかったと

,A thought occurred to me
,Lying underneath a peach tree
,A moment in the sun
,
,Our funny little lives are so brief
,Our frail little bones
,We’re here and then we’re gone
,
,Sometimes the lonely days
,Turn into the lonely decades
,Old ladies on their own
,
,The world they knew has drifted away
,Like little puffs of smoke
,We’re here and then we’re gone

,银色小船摇摇晃晃弯弯
,悬在绒绒的天上
,你的心事三三俩俩蓝蓝
,停在我幽幽心上
,你说情到深处人怎能不孤独
,爱到浓时就牵肠挂肚
,我的行李孤孤单单散散惹惆怅
,离人放逐到边界
,彷佛走入第五个季节
,昼夜乱了和谐
,潮泛任性涨退
,字典里没春天
,离人挥霍著眼泪
,回避还在眼前的离别
,你不肯说再见
,我不敢想明天
,有人说一次告别天上就会有颗星

,换你一个微笑
,我愿为爱乞讨
,愿永远做你的依靠

,只是记忆抹不掉
,你烫过的衣服
,仿佛还有温度
,却抵挡不了我寒冷孤独
,回忆总想哭
,一个人太孤独
,这段情千山万水却迷了路
,千辛万苦的付出
,早已放弃了归路
,爱到深处却只剩下无助

,一个人的幸福
,就像你最后给我那些叮嘱
,爱如何形同陌路
,你走有你走的苦
,怎知你走以后不会为我哭

,感觉很诚恳是好事
,不需要发誓 那么幼稚
,本以为可以 就这样随你
,反正我也无处可去
,我怕太负责任的人
,因为他随时会牺牲
,爱不爱都可以 我怎样都依你
,连借口 我都帮你寻
,与其在你不要的世界里
,不如痛快把你忘记
,这道理谁都懂说容易 爱透了还要嘴硬
,我宁愿 留在你方圆几里
,我的心 要不回就送你
,因为我爱你 和你没关系
,感觉会压抑的样子
,勉强也没什么意思
,我不算很自私 也越来越懂事
,爱你只是我的事
,与其在你不要的世界里

,何苦不找个人来代替
,可惜我 谁劝都不听
,我宁愿 留在你方圆几里
,我的心 要不回就送你

,Starry, starry night
,Paint your palette blue and gray
,Look out on a summer's day
,With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
,Shadows on the hills
,Sketch the trees and the daffodils
,Catch the breeze and the winter chills
,In colors on the snowy linen land
,Now I understand
,What you tried to say to me
,And how you suffered for your sanity
,And how you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they did not know how
,Perhaps they'll listen now
,Starry, starry night
,Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
,Swirling clouds in violet haze
,Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
,Colors changing hue
,Morning fields of amber grain
,Weathered faces lined in pain
,Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
,Now I understand
,What you tried to say to me
,And how you suffered for your sanity
,And how you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they did not know how
,Perhaps they'll listen now
,For they could not love you
,But still your love was true
,And when no hope was left in sight
,On that starry, starry night
,You took your life, as lovers often do
,But I could've told you Vincent
,This world was never meant for
,One as beautiful as you
,Starry, starry night
,Portraits hung in empty halls
,Frame-less heads on nameless walls
,With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
,Like the strangers that you've met
,The ragged men in ragged clothes
,The silver thorn of bloody rose
,Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
,Now I think I know
,What you tried to say to me
,And how you suffered for your sanity
,And how you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they're not listening still
,Perhaps they never will

,Put it on a necklace

,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn

,那些不堪言的疼痛
,也就是我自作自受
,你没有装聋
,你真没感动
,
,一个人的时候
,偷偷看你的微博
,你转播的歌好耳熟
,我们坐一起听过
,当日嫌它的唱法做作
,现在听起来竟然很生动
,可能是时光让耳朵变得宽容
,
,如今一个人听歌总是会觉得失落
,幻听你在我的耳边轻轻诉说
,夜色多温柔
,你有多爱我
,如今一个人听歌总是会觉得难过
,爱已不在这里我却还没走脱
,列表里的歌
,随过往流动

,先生：日本の人はあいさつに

,天気や季節の言葉をよく使います。
,先生：例えばどんな言葉ですか。
,学生：例えば「いいお天気ですね」とか、
,「暑いですね。」とか、「よく降りますね。」とか、

,ところで、先生、日本の人はどうして
,あいさつに天気や季節の言葉をよく使うのですか。
,先生：日本の人はお互いの生活に
,利益のあることを喜び合います。
,また、不利のあることを悲しみ合うのです。
,つまり、あいさつを通して、
,心を結び付けて親しくなるのです。
,学生：そうですか。
,あいさつの言葉はとても大切ですね。
,先生：ええ、
,あいさつの言葉は日本文化の一面を表しています。
,みなさんは日本語を勉強するとともに、

,第十九課  インタビュー
,（前文）
,最近、中国へ来る留学生が増えました。
,私たちの大学には今アメリカ、
,日本、イギリス、フランス、ドイツ、カナダなど
,十数か国から来た留学生が
,二百五十名ぐらいいます。
,今日は大学新聞の記者をしている李さんが
,留学生にインタビューをしました。
,留学生の多くが中国へ留学しようと思ったのは
,中国の文化に興味があったからです。
,生活環境については安全だからいいと答えています。
,もちろん、
,騒音や公害などの問題があるという人もいます。
,彼らは中国へ来てからたまに
,病気になることもあります。
,そういうときには、病院へ行ったり、
,大学の医務室で手当てを受けたりします。
,留学生は中国人の友達がおおぜいいますから、
,ふだんはよく中国語を使っています。
,ですから、言葉の違いは彼らにとって
,あまり大きな問題ではありません。
,（会話）
,記者：私は大学新聞の記者で、李と申します 。
,これ、私の名刺です。
,どうぞ、よろしくお願いします。
,皆：こちらこそ。
,記者：私たちの大学には今、
,留学生が二百五十名ぐらいいて、
,十数カ国から来ています。
,今日は留学生のみなさんに
,留学生活についてインタビューをしたいと思います。
,よろしくお願いします。
,まず、中国へ来る前に中国のことを知っていましたか。
,山田：ええ、
,中国を紹介した本をいろいろ読みましたから、
,中国のことをよく知っていました。
,ナンシー：私は中国のことを
,ぜんぜん知りませんでした。
,記者：どうして中国へ留学しようと思いましたか。
,佐藤：私は中国の文化に興味がありましたから。
,とくに北京オリンピックや
,上海万博についてのテレビ番組を見たあとで、
,中国へ留学しようと思いました。
,ジョン：私は中国へ留学すれば
,中国語が上手になるだろうと思いましたから。
,記者：生活環境をどう思いますか。
,山田：いいと思います。
,記者：どうしていいと思いますか。
,山田：安全だからです。
,記者：ピエールさんはどう思いますか。
,ピエール：私も安全でいい所だと思います。
,しかし、問題もいろいろあると思います。
,記者：たとえば？
,ピエール：大学のまわりがちょっとうるさいし、
,公害問題もあるし、
,留学生にとってあまりいい環境じゃないと思います。
,山田：でも、このあたりは大学が多いし、
,公園も近いし、留学生にとって便利だと思います。
,記者：今住んでいる寮をどう思いますか。
,ホワイト：私は非常に満足しています。
,マリー ：私はあまり満足していません。
,記者：このあたりの交通をどう思いますか。
,ホワイト：あまり便利じゃないと思います。
,記者：こちらの気候をどう思いますか。
,山田：だいたい日本と同じぐらいです。
,しかし、このごろは暑かったり、
,寒かったりで、ちょっと大変です。
,記者：みなさんは中国へ来てから
,病気になったことがありますか。
,山田：ええ。体に気をつけないと、
,病気になることがあります。
,私は一回ありました。
,ナンシー：私は二回ありました。
,マリー：私は一度もありません。
,記者：病気になったとき、どうしますか。
,ナンシー：病院へ行ったり、
,大学の医務室で手当てを受けたりします。
,記者：大学の生活はいかがですか。
,ジョン：初めは大変でしたが、
,今はもうすっかり慣れましたからとても楽しいです。
,記者：日曜日は何をしますか。
,ピエール：映画を見たり、
,町へ買い物に行ったりします。
,記者：中国人の友達がいますか。
,ジョン：ええ、中国人の友達がおおぜいいます。
,ときどき留学生寮へ遊びに来ます。

,ピエール：ええ、授業時間が長いし、
,宿題が多いし、とても大変です。
,記者：ときどき徹夜をすることもあるんですか。
,ピエール：いいえ、
,遅くまで勉強することはありますが、
,徹夜をすることはありません。
,記者：授業は全部わかりますか。
,ピエール：わかる時とわからない時があります。
,ナンシー：私もわかりやすい講義と
,わかりにくい講義があると思います。
,記者：どんな講義がわかりにくいですか。
,ナンシー：速く話す先生の講義がわかりにくいです。
,記者：講義がわからない時はどうしますか。
,ナンシー：クラスメートのノートを借りて勉強します。
,記者：教科書はどうですか。
,マリー：教科書は絵が多くてわかりやすいと思います。
,山田：私はあまりよくないと思います。
,記者：なぜよくないと思いますか。
,山田：言葉がちょっと古くて
,あまり実生活に役立たないからです。
,記者：みなさんはふだんよく中国語を使いますか。
,佐藤：ええ、中国人の友達が
,おおぜいいますからよく中国語を使います。
,記者：言葉の違いはみなさんにとって大きな問題ですか
,佐藤：いいえ、中国の方がみんな親切ですから、

,ホームステイで中国を知ろう
,留学生専用の寮で生活している外国人学生は、
,中国人の日常生活に触れる機会が少ないので、
,中国人の本当の顔はわかりません。
,しかし、家の中に入ると、
,中国人の意外な一面を知ることができます。
,ですから、
,中国人の本当の姿を知りたいと考えている留学生は、
,ぜひ中国人の家に滞在してみてください。
,最近、留学生のホームステイを受け入れたいと希望する
,中国人がだんだん増えました。
,中国の家に何日も泊まったり、
,いっしょに暮らしたりするときは、
,「お客さん」ではなくて、「家族の一員」になります。
,家庭の中でいっしょに過ごす時間が長ければ長いほど
,本当の中国や中国人を知るよい機会になります。
,同時にその家の習慣や規則に慣れることも必要です。
,はじめに「してはいけないこと」と
,「しなければいけないこと」を確かめましょう。
,家にはそれぞれの習慣や規則があります。
,また中国独特の習慣には、
,中国人自身が気づいていないこともあります。

,第二十課 春節
,（前文）
,春節のある日、
,留学生の高橋さんが李さんの家を訪ねました。
,そして李さんの家でおいしいギョーザを食べました。
,ギョーザの作り方はそれほど難しくありません。
,小麦粉をこねて薄く伸ばした皮に、
,豚肉や野菜などを包んで、
,蒸したり茹でたりすればいいのです。
,高橋さんが中国へ来てからもう半年たちました。
,中国へ来る前に、中国を紹介した本を読んだので、
,中国のことをすこし知っていました。
,彼は留学生活はとても楽しいと言っています。
,日曜日、
,彼は映画を見たり中国人の友達を訪ねたりします。
,今年の春節に、
,親しい中国人の友達が結婚をするので、
,高橋さんは国へ帰りません。
,彼は友達に何かプレゼントしたいと思っています。
,そして、中国人の結婚式を見たことがまだないから、
,友達の結婚披露宴にも出席したいと思っています。
,高橋さんは自分一人で行くと寂しいと思って、
,李さんを誘ってみました。
,（会話）
,李：さあ、もうおなかがすいたでしょう。
,どうぞ食べてください。
,高橋：ああ、おいしそうですね。
,ギョーザは中国の人にとても人気がありますね。
,李：ええ。わたしの家は新上海人ですから、
,旧正月には、
,やはり北国の習慣でギョーザを食べます。
,今日は何もありませんが、
,たくさん食べてください。
,高橋：はい、じゃ、遠慮なくいただきます。
,李：どうぞ。
,高橋：ほんとうにおいしいですね。
,どうやって作るんですか。
,李：それほど難しくありません。
,小麦粉をこねて薄く伸ばした皮に
,豚肉や野菜などを包んで、
,蒸したり茹でたりすればいいのです。
,高橋：そうですか。作りやすいですね。
,李：ええ。でも、
,豚肉や野菜などを入れすぎてはいけません。
,入れすぎると、ギョーザの味がまずくなります。
,高橋：なるほど。
,それがおいしく作るこつですか。
,李：はい、そうです。それがこつです。
,ところで、
,高橋さんは中国へ来てからもう半年たちましたね。
,高橋：ええ。時のたつのは速いですね。
,李：高橋さんが中国へ来る前に中国のことを
,知っていましたか。
,高橋：ええ、中国を紹介する本を
,いろいろ読みましたから、

,李：高橋さんはどうして
,中国へ留学しようと思ったんですか。

,中国へ留学しようと思いました。
,李：そうですか。
,こちらの留学生活をどう思いますか。
,高橋：とてもいいと思います。
,李：なぜそう思いますか。

,もちろん、問題もいろいろあると思いますが……
,李：たとえば？
,高橋：最近、
,寮のテレビの映りが悪くて困っているんです。
,李：どうしたんですか。
,高橋：電波障害ですよ。
,最近、
,まわりに新しい高層ビルがどんどん建ったんです。
,李：そうですか。
,高橋：それから、まわりの騒音問題もあるし、
,大気汚染の問題もあるし、
,留学生にとってあまりいい環境じゃないと思います。
,李：しかし、このあたりは大学も多いし、
,公園も近いし、みなさんにとって便利でしょう。
,高橋：ええ、それはそうですね。
,でも、市内までの交通はあまり便利じゃないんです。
,李：日曜日には何をしていますか。
,高橋：日曜日には映画を見たり、
,中国人の友達を訪ねたりしています。
,李：授業についてはどう思いますか。
,高橋：授業時間が日本より長いし、
,宿題も多いし、とても大変ですね。
,李：春節にはどうして日本へ帰らないんですか。
,高橋：実は春節に、
,親しい中国人の友達が結婚するんです。
,李：そうですか。それはおめでたいですね。
,高橋：中国の結婚式のやりかたは
,日本とずいぶん違うでしょうね。
,友達に何かプレゼントしたいんですが、
,どんなものがいいでしょうか。
,李：そうですね。
,何か新しい生活に役に立つものがいいでしょう。
,高橋：そのとおりですね。
,中国では、
,結婚する人に普通何をプレゼントしますか。
,李：普通、コーヒーセットや電気スタンド、
,花びんなどをプレゼントします。
,高橋：花びんがいいですね。
,その人は花が大好きですから。
,李：じゃあ、花びんをもらうと、
,きっとよろこぶでしょう。
,高橋さんは友達の結婚披露宴に出席するんですか。
,高橋：ええ、
,行かないと失礼ですから出席したいと思っています。
,李：中国人の結婚式を見たことがありますか。
,高橋：いいえ、
,中国の結婚式はまだ見たことがないんです。
,李：では、中国人の結婚式を初めて見るんですね。
,高橋：そうなんです。
,ですからとても楽しみにしています。
,李：どうぞ、ぜひ見てください。
,高橋：はい。しかし、
,友達は私が一人で行くと寂しいだろうと心配して、
,大学の友人を誘っても
,かまわないと言っているんです。
,それで李さんといっしょに
,行こうと思っているんですが、
,いかがでしょうか。
,李：それはどうもありがとうございます。
,結婚式はいつですか。
,高橋：来週の土曜日です。
,李：会場はどこですか。
,高橋：杏花楼です。
,李：いいところですね。
,じゃ、どこで待ち合わせましょうか。
,高橋：午後四時半に留学生寮の前でどうですか。
,李：はい、わかりました。

,冬休みが終わり、いよいよ新学期が始まりました。
,今日は暇なので、王さんは留学生の山崎さんを尋ねました。
,山崎さんはとても親切な人で、友達が来る時には、いつも部屋をきれいに掃除しておいたり、お菓子を買ってきておいたりします。

,現代の食生活
,食生活は風土や生活水準、生活様式などと、深い関係があります。
,中国では、二十世紀八十年代改革開放後の経済高度成長期に入ると、
,個人の所得が著しく伸びて、どの家庭もテレビや洗濯機などを使い、
,家事の負担が軽くなりました。
,こうした所得の伸びや生活様式の変化は、
,食生活にも大きく影響し、人々の食べ物の量や質、
,そして食事についての考え方を変えました。
,たとえば、以前は米、肉、魚が中心の食事でしたが、
,現在では、パン、乳製品などが多くなりました。
,また、人々が、お茶よりコーヒー、紅茶、コーラ、 ジュースなどを好み、
,紹興酒や白酒のほかにビールやウィスキー、ワインなどを多く飲んでいます。
,とくに若者の食生活が大きく変わりました。
,コンビニエンスストアやファミリーレストラン、
,ファーストフードなど外食産業が急激に発展するとともに若者の生活の国際化が顕著になりました。
,このような急激な変化の背景には、核家族化や少子化が進んで、家族団欒で食事をする機会が減っているという原因があります。

,留学生の田中さんは日曜日に、浦東の世紀公園へ行こうと思いました。
,彼は交通係に道を尋ねて、地下鉄に乗りました。
,地下鉄では、駅員がマイクでアナウンスしたり、車内放送を流したりしますが、上海の道がまだよくわからない田中さんは乗客にいろいろ聞きました。
,乗客は親切に彼に教えました。
,留学生寮で近いから、田中さんは自転車で学校に通っていますが、通学生の徐さんは家が学校から遠いので、地下鉄を利用しています。
,ですから、朝も夕方も込 む電車に乗らなければなりません。
,それでも、徐さんはいつも電車の中で、MP3を聞きながら、日本語を熱心勉強しています。
,会話
,（地下鉄駅の近く）
,交通係：みなさん、危ないですから、車道の中を歩かないでください。
,危ないですから、車道を横切らないでください。
,道を横切る時は左と右をよく見て、横断歩道を通ってください。
,田中：すみません、ちょっと伺いますが。
,交通係：はい、何ですか。
,田中：浦東の世紀公園へ行きたいんですが、どう行ったらいいんでしょうか。
,交通係：地下鉄に乗ってください。
,田中：地下鉄の駅はどこですか。
,交通係：あそこの店の前です。ほら、いま、バスが止まった所です。
,田中：そうですか。どうもありがとうございました。
,（プラットホーム。五分して地下鉄の電車が来る。駅員がマイクでアナウンスする。）
,駅員：この電車はいちご線で、莘荘行きです。　
,危ないですから押さないでください。
,危ないですから、ひとりひとり順にお乗りください。
,お乗りの方が大勢いますから入り口には立たないでください。　
,込んできましたから、できるだけ奥に詰めてください。　
,ドアが閉まります。ご注意ください。
,（車内）
,田中：すみません、ちょっと伺いたいんですが。
,乗客：はい、何ですか。
,田中：浦東の世紀公園へ行きたいんですが、どう行ったらいいでしょうか。
,乗客：人民広場でお乗換えください。
,田中：はい、分かりました。人民広場の駅はここからいくつ目ですか。
,乗客：六つ目です。
,田中：どうもありがとうございました。
,（車内放送）
,お待たせしませた。この電車は莘荘行きです。　
,…新閘路、人民広場、黃陂南路…終点莘荘の順に停車いたします。　
,常に安全運転を心掛けておりますが、事故防止のため、止むを得ず急停車することがありますので、ご注意ください。　
,発車します。　
,揺れますからお立ちの方は釣革や手摺りにしっかりお掴まりください。
,次は人民広場です。浦東方面においでのお客様は、二号線の電車にお乗換えです。
,お降りのお客様はお忘れ物をなさいませんようお支度ください。
,ご乗車、お疲れ様ですた。
,（浦東方面の電車の車内放送）
,毎度ご利用くださいまして、誠にありがとうございます。
,上海科学館、上海科学館…
,田中：ちょっと、すみません。今の放送がよくわからなかったんですが、世紀公園はまだですか。
,駅員：あ、次ですよ。
,田中：どうもありがとうございます。
,（車内放送）
,毎度ご利用くださいまして、誠にありがとうございます。
,世紀公園前、世紀公園前…
,（プラットホーム）
,田中：すみません、世紀公園前でうすね。
,駅員：はい、そうです。
,田中：ここから世紀公園まで遠いですか。
,駅員：いいえ、それほど遠くありません。
,この道をまっすぐ言って、2つ目の角を左に曲がると、世紀公園の通りに出ます。
,田中：その角から世紀公園が見えますか。
,駅員：はい、正面に見えます。
,田中：どうもありがとうございました。
,（大学で）
,徐：田中さんはいつも留学生寮から学校までなんで通っているんですか。
,田中：近いから、たいてい自転車で通っていますが、雨の日はタクシーに乗ったりします。
,徐：それはいいですね。　通学生の私はうちから学校まで遠いですから、いつも地下鉄を利用しています。
,田中：地下鉄は朝も夕方も込んでいますか。
,徐：ええ。でも、夕方は朝ほど込んでいません。
,朝は電車が遅れてくるし、込んでいるので、とても疲れます。
,田中：ラッシュは大変でしょうね。
,徐：ええ、事故が起こった時はいくらまっても電車がなかなか来ません。
,田中：それは大変ですね。
,徐：そして、電車の中はすし詰めで、全然身動きもできなくて、ほんとうにいやです。
,田中：授業に遅れては困りますね。
,徐：そうです。ですから、このごろ、私は早めに家を出るようにしています。
,田中：電車は空いていますか。
,徐：空いてはいませんが、いくらか増しです。
,私は電車の中でMP3を聞きながら日本語を勉強していますよ。
,田中：それは感心ですね。
,徐：しかし、上海の交通問題はますます深刻になっていくでしょう。
,ほんとうに心配ですね。
,田中：悲観しないでください。
,日本のように地下鉄さえどんどん作れば交通事情もだんだんよくなっていくでしょう。

,読み取り機の上にカードをかざすだけで料金支払いが完了します。
,電車および地下鉄の各駅、コンビニエンスストア、マクドナルドなどで購入、チャージすることが出来ます。
,有効期限は最後のチャージから二年間です。
,カードが不要になった場合は大衆交通チケットセンターなどで返却することができます。
,カードの使用可能の範囲は地下鉄、タクシー、バスのほか、フェリーや高速道路などです。
,地下鉄の料金は距離に比例して違います。
,磁気カード式の切符を構内の券売機で購入します。購入後は改札を通って入場し、到着駅でも同様に出場します。
,タクシー会社は大衆、強生、錦江など二〇社以上あります。
,乗り方は簡単で、手をあげて車を停め、行き先を告げればいいです。
,英語の普及率がまだ低 いため外国人のお客様は地図または行き先を記してある紙を準備するほうがよいです。
,後者の際にはレシートを受け取っておくほうがよいでしょう。
,タクシー会 社名と電話番号、走行距離などが記され、トレブル時の助けとなります。
