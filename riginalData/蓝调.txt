,I wish you could see me
,All broken down this way
,But even if you saw me, baby
,I know I still couldn't make you stay
,Couldn't make you stay
,You know about the high cost of loving
,But someday, someday
,You're gonna have to pay
,Gonna have to pay
,Oh, a woman like you needs fine things
,And I knew it from the start
,And I don't have much to offer
,Just this old broken heart, hey baby
,Just this old broken heart
,But if heartaches were nickels
,I wouldn't be here crying in the dark
,Yes, if wine and pills were hundred dollar bills,
,I might keep you satisfied
,And if broken dreams were limousines
,I might take you for a ride
,And all I can do is think of you
,And wish you were here by my side
,Yes, if heartaches were nickels

Let go of your love
Ride his pulse and you forget
Slow down, your time will come
If not tonight, surely by the dawn
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
A cat's eye, a lizard's tail
The pentagram, he bought in hell
He stalks the night with no intent
His brow sweets for innocence
And take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
The rain's soul makes kill and cry
He wants desperately to die
But fast and skillfully forgets
He's back on the street with no regrets
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
Into the strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange, strange

,She can't see she's making me crazy now
,I don't believe she knows she's amazing how
,She has me holding my breathe
,So I'd never guess that I'm a none such unsuitable, suited for her
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentery
,And oh, it goes to show
,The moral of the story is boy loves girl
,And so on but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told
,I know that I should be brave
,Even pretty can be seen by the blind
,I know that I cannot wait
,Until the day we finally learn how to find each other
,Redefining open minds
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed
,And it's golden, it goes to show then
,The ending of this song should be left alone
,And so on 'cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told

Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.
My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt
So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.
I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

Hues of blues and greens surround me
Knowing you have found another love
Has turned me world to sorrow
Green with envy for another
Fearing she may be the one to soar
Through life with you, can't lose these
Hues of blues in green

,I hear ur voice by ears
,And i still can't believe i did see u
,In far away place, u write ur words and
,Pour it to me in my weak self
,Ur papers filled with emotions of u
,And so, u let me know
,The age of four u've got with the pals
,i can only hope u will stick with them
,With all the love u receive
,And sparklings around u, still near u
,And all the moments u get passed through
,Will leave u with beautiful light
,When i can finally see u soon again
,I hope my name is said
,I love how warm ur existence is
,U bring me to the breeze
,I love ur autumn view whenever i see u

,No university, no degree

,Put her ass to sleep
,Woke her up around one
,She didn't hesitate, to call ice cube the top gun
,Drove her to the pad and i'm coasting
,Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
,I was glad everything had worked out
,Dropped her ass off, then i chirped out
,Today was like one of those fly dreams
,Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
,No helicopter looking for a murder
,Two in the morning got the fat burger
,Even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
,And it read ice cube's a pimp
,Drunk as hell but no throwing up
,Half way home and my pager still blowing up

作曲 : Loving
Let talk about love
Let talk about love
Ooh love
You can feel it, but you can see it
You can taste it, but you can hear it
You can say it, if you don mean it
You can buy it, if you don need it
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?
They say only fool fall in love, but love was meant for all of us
So what we think we know we don, cause you can never know enough
Do we think love is so material so physical, and sensual
Cause in the war it will destroy your soul, so one really knows
It can make you laugh
Make you cry
Make you tell the truth
Make you tell a lie
It could be your life
Or it could be your death
Figure it out, it makes no sense
You can feel it, but you can see it
You can taste it, but you can hear it
You can say it, if you don mean it
You can buy it, if you don need it
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?
We think love is perpetual, but the one who loves you will let you go
The pleasure that is imaginable, it will make you leave a happy home
But all we take is love for serious, do we really know what it means to us
Cause if it wasn for love we wouldn be born, but no one really ever knows
Why it puts us together, it tears us apart
It can even mend it, or break your heart
What we have for our self, what you say to your child
But I still wonder why
You can feel it, but you can see it
You can taste it, but you can hear it
You can say it, if you don mean it
You can buy it, if you don need it
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?
Physical affection, emotions
Feelings, honest
Wanting, opposites of desire
Longing, needing
Craving, lusting
Baby you light my fire
Graduation, kissing
Hugging, touching
Yearning, sexing
Mother to her child
These are the thing that we really need
When we talk about this thing called love
You can feel it, but you can see it
You can taste it, but you can hear it
You can say it, if you don mean it
You can buy it, if you don need it
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?
You can feel it, but you can see it
You can taste it, but you can hear it
You can say it, if you don mean it
You can buy it, if you don need it
You talk so much about it, what is the meaning
It makes no sense, so what the reason
Tell me why do we fall in love?
,
You tell me that you love me
And I say I love you, too
And I look right in your eyes, girl
And say I'll never cheat on you
,
And I go into the world
And the temptation begins
No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl
But there's a battle so deep within
,
But I fight for your love
Girl, I just can't give up
Looking at your pictures in my phone
Girl you know that ass is too much
,
Girl, you better not give my lovin' away
Girl, I told you I was here to stay
Girl, you make me feel some kind of way
You the shit, girl ain't nun else to say
It's too much, too much
Girl you know that it's too much, too much
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
,
When we're together
You know it's the best feeling in the world
It's like I can't see nobody but you (yeah)
Feels like you're the only girl
,

,Memories always start 'round midnight
,'Round midnight
,Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
,When my heart is still with you
,And old midnight knows it too
,When some quarrel we had needs mending
,Does it mean that our love is ending
,Darling I need you
,Lately I find
,You're out of my arms
,And I'm out of my mind
,Let our love take wing some midnight
,'Round midnight
,Let the angels sing
,For your returning
,Let our love be safe and sound
,When old midnight comes around
,Let our love take wing some midnight

,What is your future, now we have to part
,Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away
,Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay

,Make way, oh, make way for my Eastern Rose
,Men crowd in dozens everywhere she goes
,In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret

,All my life I shall remember
,Oriental music and you in my arms
,Perfumed flowers in your tresses
,Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms

,Rose, Rose I love you with your almond eyes
,Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies
,I must cross the seas again and never see you more

,One evening as the sun went down
,And the jungle fires were burning,
,Down the track came a hobo hiking,
,And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
,I'm headed for a land that's far away
,Besides the crystal fountains
,So come with me, we'll go and see
,The Big Rock Candy Mountains
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
,There's a land that's fair and bright,
,Where the handouts grow on bushes
,And you sleep out every night.
,Where the boxcars all are empty
,And the sun shines every day
,And the birds and the bees
,And the cigarette trees
,The lemonade springs
,Where the bluebird sings
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
,All the cops have wooden legs
,And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
,And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
,The farmers' trees are full of fruit
,And the barns are full of hay
,Oh I'm bound to go
,Where there ain't no snow
,Where the rain don't fall
,The winds don't blow
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
,You never change your socks
,And the little streams of alcohol
,Come trickling down the rocks
,The brakemen have to tip their hats
,And the railway bulls are blind
,There's a lake of stew
,And of whiskey too
,You can paddle all around it
,In a big canoe
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
,The jails are made of tin.
,And you can walk right out again,
,As soon as you are in.
,There ain't no short-handled shovels,
,No axes, saws nor picks,
,I'm bound to stay
,Where you sleep all day,
,Where they hung the jerk
,That invented work
,In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
Keep On The Sunny Side
,There's a dark & a troubled side of life
,But there's a bright and a sunny side, too
,Tho' you meet with the darkness and strife
,The sunny side you also may view
,Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
,Keep on the sunny side of life
,It will help us ev'ry day, it will brighten all the way
,If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
,Tho' the storm and it's furies raged today,
,Crushing hope that we cherish so dear;
,The cloud & storm will, in time, pass away
,And the sun again will shine bright & clear.
,Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
,Keep on the sunny side of life
,It will help us ev'ry day, it will brighten all the way
,If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
,Let us greet with the song of hope each day
,Tho' the moment be cloudy or fair
,Let us trust in our Saviour always
,Who keepeth everyone in His care

,The place where I was born and raised
,The place where he was born and raised
,For six long years I've been in trouble
,No pleasures here on earth I found

,I never expect to see you again
,For I'm bound to ride that northern railroa
,Perhaps I'll die upon this train
,Perhaps he'll die upon this train
,You can bury me in some deep valley
,For many years where I may lay
,Then you may learn to love another
,While I am sleeping in my grave
,While he is sleeping in his grave
,Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
,My face you'll never see no more
,But there is one promise that is given
,I'll meet you on God's golden shore
,He'll meet you on God's golden shore

,A dream boat with hard lock hands
,Fingers full of pearl rings

,At the end of the pier
,Watching all the ships go by
,With the shell against her ear
,And now she takes her leave
,Cos there's nothing left here to believe
,And she walks beneath the waves once more
,She rides again
,Riding a shell some kind of hollow eve
,And walks upon new golden shore
,And if you see her go ask her where's she's been
,Just kneel and follow the sound of that tambourine

,Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
,Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
,Or maybe it's wrong but you're turning me on.
,Ooh, we'll take a visit to your Mama's house

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry
Five days since you laughed at me saying
Get that together come back and see me
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hood wink
As I make you stop think
You'll think you're looking at aqua man
I summon fish to the dish although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the Sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like Wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry
Chickity China of the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the smoking man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like snickers guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurasawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back swing
Gotta get in tune with sailor moon
'Cause the cartoon has got the boom Anime Babes
That make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry
Five days since I laughed at you and said
You just did just what I thought you were gonna do
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

Her glance hits me like lightning 
I heard that girl is fast and frightening 
Dirty hair and a laugh that's mean 
Her neighbors call her an evil machine 
She's fast, she's lean 
She's frightening 
She's fast, she's lean 
She's frightening 
Popping wheelies on her motorbike 
Straight girls wish they were dykes 
She'll do anything on a dare 
Mom and Daddy's worst nightmare 
Down at the creek smoking pot 
She eats the roach so she don't get caught 
Throws her mini off in the halls 
Got so much clit she don't need no balls

作曲 : Clor
I was in love but that was yesterday
Now I'm in pain and it's here to stay
I was the bird that buzzed the bees and stole the honey
The ones that you want they're the ones that get away
The ones that you need never wanted to stay
And there'll remain those few in-between ones, they are susceptible
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
You look a little
I was in love but that was yesterday
Now I'm in pain and it's here to stay
I was the bird that buzzed the bees and stole the honey
I was aloof
But still this fire's out
Even in spurts
Seen it all before
We get it on
If only to find out
Why we're unsuitable
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
You look a little 

,Sometimes I feel I've got to. . . run away'
,I've got to. . . get away'
,from the pain you drive into the heart of me'
,the love we share seems to go nowhere'
,and I've lost my life'
,for I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.
,
,Once I ran to you
,this tainted love you've given.
,I gave you all a boy could give you.
,take my tears and that's not really all. . .
,Tainted love' ohh...' tainted love
,
,now I know I've got to. . . run away.
,I've got to. . . get away.
,You don't really want any more from me'
,to make things right you need someone to hold you tight'
,and you think love is to pray'
,but I'm sorry I don't pray that way.
,
,Once I ran to you
,This tainted love you've given'
,I gave you all a boy could give you.
,Take my tears and that's not really all. . .
,Tainted love' ohh' tainted love.
,Don't touch me please' I cannot stand the way you tease'
,I love you though you hurt me so.
,Now I'm gonna pack my things and go.
,Tainted love' ohh ...
,Tainted love' ohh ...
,Tainted love' ohh ...
,Tainted love' ohh ...
,Touch me baby' tainted love

,Drink seltzer smoke weed when you can't sleep.
,Think about shooting birds,
,everyone has got a violent streak.
,I think my face looks like glass,
,but my body feels plastic.
,Melt me into a bottle.
,I wish that I was a baby sucking on myself.
,Boogie down to the water.
,I thought that maybe
,I could be the lake's daughter.
,Because I float like an infant inside of it,
,weightless in the lake.
,It's got nothing to take from me.
,I feel like a child,
,hiding behind your tombstone.
,But the graveyard's not lonely.
,Plus, who doesn't love a good cemetery?
,I feel like a fetus.
,Because my eyes are not open,
,and I don't have fingernails.
,Can't claw my way out of anyone, or anything.
,Hold me under the water,
,My lungs are filling with plankton.
,But the lake is not lonely,
,No need for you to come with me.
,
,In spite of being so late to the game
,I won't fight fate
,It's now too late
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew
,And every morning when I rise
,Those cold and blue eyes on the tube
,No worse came true
,The binds that break off and shatter off when you fall down from the top
,And your heart stops
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew
,And if the dawn don't break me
,If I don't become after
,No time to go back and find who was chasing which disaster
,I hold the truth like a tight noose
,And sometimes you
,It's getting hard to get along with your new love song so soon
,Can it really be true?
,The binds that break off and shatter off when you fall down from the top
,And your heart stops
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew me
,You used to be the one that knew me
,You used to be the one

,She was a shark smile in a yellow van
,She came around and I stole a glance
,In my youth, a vampire
,Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
,It came over me at a bad time
,But who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line?
,I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam
,
,And she said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too
,
,It came over her at a bad time
,Riding through Winona down the dotted line
,Held us gunning out
,90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
,She looked over with a part smile
,Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
,And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering
,
,As she said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too
,
,Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
,I leaned over to take it in
,As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
,It came over me at a bad time
,She burned over the double line
,And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail
,Ooh the guardrail
,Ooh the guardrail
, x2
,She said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too

,Wander into the unknown
,Chances are here I was told
,Crossing the footsteps of new and of old
,Recurring smiles in the air
,Sky blue and life full of cheer
,Stories of people unfold
,And all we'd imagined is here
,Travel on into the dawn
,Where memories grow
,Sway along with all the names
,That this life may hold
,It's the little things little things
,Laugh through the night
,Through the crowd
,Till the end of the road
,Travel on beyond the dawn
,Where everyone knows
,Faces familiar
,A place I'd call home
,If there's anything anything
,I'd ask about in the end
,Where will I wake up tomorrow

,Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens

,Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
,These are a few of my favorite things
,Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
,Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
,Silver white winters that melt into springs

,when the bee stings
,When I'm feeling sad
,I simply remember my favorite things

,You couldn't tie me down to anything and that's enough for me

You don't know all the beauty you posses inside
You just can't see what I see in you
I see everything I've needed
I see my reason for breathing
You're the only one who holds my world in their hands
You're everything I am
And if you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me
If you could see you through my eyes
If you could see you
You should know no one else could ever take your place
Don't think I'll ever stop needing you
I need everything about you
Can't see a life lived without you
You're my only heaven
You're my world, you're my dream
You're everything to me
And if you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me
If you could see you through my eyes
You would see, you would see
What you mean, mean to me
You would know
There's no one else I need
You would feel, what I feel
You would know
There's no way to change
This love I have inside
And if you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me
If you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me
If you could see you through my eyes
If you could see you, oh through my eyes
If you could see you through my eyes
Oh, through my eyes

Ooh yeah
Yahoo hoo
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare
You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go
You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it
If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
Prove it
If you love me say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
Oh I, oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love all around you, honey
And if you come, you gotta show, baby
True love to share
Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

GROWING UP CAN BE A PAIN
YOU'RE NOT AN MAN UNTIL YOU COME OF AGE
WE'VE GIVEN UP OUR TEENAGE YEARS
IN THE EFFORT TO PURSUE OUR CAREER
WHO ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY
OF HAVING TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES
WHO'S PROTECTING US FROM HARM
IS THERE ANYONE AROUND
THAT WE CAN TRUST
SO WE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
NO ANSWERS BUT WE'RE TAUGHT A LESSON EVERYTIME
THROUGH MISTAKES WE'VE LEARNED TO GATHER WISDOM
LIFE'S RESPONSIBILITY FALLS IN OUR HANDS
KEEP ON LEARNING
KEEP ON GROWING
'CAUSE WISDOM HELPS US UNDERSTAND
WE'RE MATURING
WITHOUT KNOWING
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT CHANGE BOYS TO MEN
OH THE GOALS WE SET MAY EXCEED REALITY
CAUSE FAILUREALWAYS A POSSIBILITY
WHO CAN TELL US THAT WE'RE WRONG
IT'S UP TO US TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT
SO WE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
LOOKING FOR THE ANSWERS
NO ANSWERS BUT WE'RE TAUGHT A LESSON EVERYTIME
THROUGH MISTAKES WE'VE LEARNED TO GATHER WISDOM
'CAUSE WISDOM HELPS US SEE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

,I  love  you  I  love  you  and  I  love  you  for  that  baby
,
,Girl, there are no words to say
,What I feel in my heart
,You, you're on my mind, night and day
,And it hurts me when we're apart
,When you're not here by my side
,There is nothing in this world for me
,I guess I'm crazy
,Crazy for you, can't you see
,And although you may think, it's crazy
,Here it's where I want to be,
,I will always need your love
,Well now,
,I can see every dream
,When I look in your eyes
,And though, things never are what they seem
,There is one thing that I realize
,That there's no doubt in my mind
,We can make this love go on forever
,I guess I'm crazy
,Crazy for you, can't you see
,Although you may think it's crazy
,Here it's where I'll always be
,And I need you with me
,Cos you are the dream that finally came true in me
,In all my life there'll be no one else
,If I looked all my life there could be no one else
,And for the rest of my life
,All I need is you
How do I get close to you when you seem so far away? 
What I wouldn't give to talk to you, face to face. 
I have to keep believing, that it won't be very long. 
Till the day I look up, and it won't be a dream. 
Chains breaking all around me, I can finally be free. 
So if you are wondering what you mean to me. 
You've changed my whole reality. 
And nothing in this world can take my heart, because, 
I'll do anything, anything for you. 
I'll do anything, if you only ask me to. 
I'll do anything, anything just to be with you. 
How do I keep getting up, every time I fall down? 
Such a strange kind of walking, with my feet up off the ground. 
I'm not giving up, till I make it back home. 
Where I know you'll be waiting, with your arms open wide. 
What a day for reunions, when we meet up in the sky. 
Somehow I know it will be worth it all. 
These tears I cry, the times I fall. 
Because you've made yourself so very real to me. 
I'll do anything, anything for you. 
I'll do anything, if you only ask me to. 
I'll do anything, anything just to be with you. 
I'm waiting for the day, when we can fly away. 
Promise me you'll live inside my heart, my heart. 
I'll do anything, anything for you. 
I'll do anything, if you only ask me to. 
I'll do anything, anything just to be with you. 
I'll go anywhere, if I can be right by your side. 
And I'll give up everything, everything, 
just to look into your eyes. 
I'll do anything, anything.

I remember Paris in '49. 

The Champs Elysee, 

Saint Michel and old Beaujolais wine.

And I recall that you were mine 

in those Parisienne days. 

Looking back at the photographs. 

Those summer days spent outside corner cafes. 

Oh, I could write you paragraphs, 

about my old Parisienne days.

,In these dark days, since you've been gone
,Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes im dyin
,Standing through once step at a time
,I have good days, bad days...Sunshine and rain
,I have good days and bad days
,But somethings never change
,Somedays i wake up and i make up my mind
,Today is the day, I'll leave the past all behind
,Im alright till some now again

,
,Had to keep on till a line went empty
,Had to keep on till it came on wide
,Keep on burnin' when the fire was dying
,Till I burn it down...
,I've been lookin' on the dark side
,I don't know what I've thought I could find
,Now there's a stranger in the mirror
,Lookin' back at me, he says it's a payback time
,I could drift away so easy to that old familiar place
,But it's a high price to pay
,I've ran out of excuses and it's hard to face
,But I believe I've lost my way
,I wouldn't cut out to be alone
,But I keep findin' myself alone
,I wear the silence like an overcoat
,And the nightmare lingers on
,I had a dream about a sister who lived alone since gone away
,I reached out and touched her face
,Then she burr to read in silence and she began to pray
,And I knew I'd lost my way
,And I knew I'd lost my way

,Every time you are near?
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,Why do stars fall down from the sky
,Every time you walk by?
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you
,On the day that you were born the angels got together
,And decided to create a dream come true
,So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
,And starlight in your eyes of blue
,That is why all the boys in town
,Follow you all around
,Just like me, they long to be
,Close to you

,It's late in the evening
,She's wondering what clothes to wear
,She puts on her make-up
,And brushes her long blonde hair
,And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
,And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."
,A noite é de festa
,E ela veste o luar
,Me arrasta me testa
,Se sente uma superstar
,E então pergunta se eu estou em paz
,E eu digo sim

,And the wonder of it all
,Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

,Me deita me abraça
,Me beija não quer fala

,Darling, estavas linda até de mais
,I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight
,I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight

,I can't believe it's over
,I watched the whole thing fall
,And I never saw the right man was on the wall
,If I'd only knew
,Days were slipping past
,That the good things never last
,That you were crying
,Summer turned to winter
,And the snow it turned to rain
,And the rain turned into tears upon your face
,I hardly recognized the girl you are today
,And god I hope it's not too late
,It's not too late

,Oh it seems to me  sorry seems to be your hardest word
,It's sad, so sad
,It's a sad, sad situation.
,And it's getting more and more absurd.
,It's sad, so sad
,That sorry seems to be the hardest word.
,Why can't we talk it over?
,Oh it seems to me
,What I got to do to make you love me?
,What I got to do to be heard?
,What do I do when lightning strikes me?
,What have I got to do?
,What have I got to do?
,When sorry seems to be the hardest word.
All through the Night
Cyndi Lauper

All through the night
I'll be awake and i'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
~nmusic~
Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile
We have no past we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end

,从没说过爱着谁
,为谁而憔悴
,从来没有想过对不对
,我的眼中装满疲惫
,面对自己总觉得好累
,我也需要人来陪
,不让我心碎
,让我爱到深处不后悔
,其实我并不像他们说的
,那样多刺难以安慰
,爱人的心应该没有罪
,为何在夜里却一再流泪
,每天抱着寂寞入睡
,生活过得没有滋味
,别问我是谁
,请与我相恋
,我的真心没人能够体会
,像我这样的人不多
,为何还要让我难过
,别问我是谁
,请和我面对
,看看我的眼角流下的泪
,我和你并没有不同
,但我的心更容易破碎
,
,现在若然没有你 天天都似没新意
,我会变另一个人 望着自己都会怀疑
,现在若然没有你 一天哭上万千次
,到眼泪不再流 昨日热爱未休止
,人世间多少快乐多少可以知
,这生开心会是多少日子
,但求让我每一天都交给你
,陪同分享所有分享一片痴
,不管你我一生曾经多少故事
,祈求让我可跟你愉快爱一次
,昨日艳阳下我似 天天都缺乏新意
,到了爱象一个人 就象活于千个梦儿
,愿为热情没理智 牺牲一切亦想试
,怕某日失去时 是恨是爱未开始
,人世间多少快乐多少可以知
,这生开心会是多少日子
,但求让我每一天都交给你
,陪同分享所有分享一片痴
,不管你我一生曾经多少故事

,来日纵使千千晚星
,亮过今晚月亮
,都比不起这宵美丽
,亦绝不可使我更欣赏
,Aha 因你今晚共我唱

,有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
,在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
,可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你
,留下的只有带着你味道的一封信
,就在昨天还一起看我们的照片
,可现在让我感觉像烂剧里的主演
,为什么这种事情会发生在我身边
,是不是老天没能看到对你的疯癫
,还想着创造你的宇宙
,但现在已经被我清空
,你让我整个人都冰冻
,还怎么再次为你心动
,Wake me 不是你的意愿
,离开我开始新的起点
,可能我还会对你贪恋
,谁让你曾经让我疯癫
,疯癫那也是过去的画面
,看往后的几天
,我猜你也不会出现
,我回想这几年
,就像是要命的病变
,你可能听不见
,来自他对你的挂念
,可能有点累觉得对不对
,这是第几次在为你宿醉
,没了我肩膀你在谁身旁
,买的礼物变成了灰
,曾经我多想把你变漂亮
,看着别人羡慕你的模样
,没关系有小熊陪着你看月亮
,我已经看到跟你断电的过程
,但我假装看不见
,是不是要我变得像个厉鬼
,才能进入你的世界
,为什么不说再见
,我猜你应该是不小心的忘记
,都无所谓也有点累
,也可以开始新的记忆
,有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
,在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
,可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你

,为什么这种事情会发生在我身边
,是不是老天没能看到对你的疯癫
,我不能够停止啊
,这些年我对你的疯癫
,戴上那条围巾吗
,在每个寒风刺骨的冬天
,每次送你回家你抱着我
,不经意间又触碰到你的手
,你穿裙子眨眼睛望着我
,让我每次心动的瞬间
,那条十字路口
,始终有你身上的气味
,车水马龙过后的
,路灯下的身影又会是谁
,他想说我真的喜欢你
,但是每次欲言又闭嘴
,那时荒唐的男孩又浑浊了几岁
,有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
,在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
,可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你

,情于我心　半生作弄人
,谁知两心　欠缘份
,留下了心事　总少不免
,谁又会甘心去忍
,曾经怨他　怨他爱别人
,仍深爱他　变遗憾
,留下了心事　追忆的脸
,无路退　守候缘份
,青春不可等候总过去
,心头抑郁有时会落泪
,纵憔悴总偷偷的想你
,谁明白我于孤单中寄居

,你说你喜欢粉色香槟的粉
,我问你是否爱过一个不该爱过的人
,你说是否过于浪漫一切会失真
,我说我感觉自己现在好像拿破仑
,你突然笑笑 这画面感觉惟妙惟肖
,这氛围缠绕 有时候 浪漫多妖娆
,慢慢变熟悉 动作也渐渐随意
,我事先声明 今天我可没**
,你问我口感怎样 我如实回答
,我说你长的漂亮 你说谢谢夸奖
,进入正题 我话题随机 文字的功底
,你闭上眼睛 我把画面传给你
,这回忆一样的初夏之风叫千羽
,多年以后会温暖的把你回忆起
,你说再浪漫的语言都不及我爱你
,我说这么直接 会吓到我自己
,
,（你温柔的拂面）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,（三月的春艳）
,这叫千羽的风 是不是拿破仑的初恋
,这个世界线的这一夜 只为了你出现
,我向你描绘着书籍里的点点红尘
,你说你不知何时才能遇见想遇见的人
,轻描淡写的口吻 一切随缘 会等
,一人好过 敌不过 两人的体温
,我还是烟雾环绕
,把话题打住
,免得你思绪焦躁
,浪漫的夜晚还是用浪漫去探讨
,手里的北极光 燃烧并发出讯号
,我让你重温时间 那些曾发过的誓言
,恰好的晕眩 慢慢回忆两人画面
,恰巧的浮现 恰当的描绘他的脸
,恰到你最爱的季节 他却向你告别
,分开的时候总带有太多抱歉
,伤感的季节又积累太多抱怨
,热恋的触觉 败给了时间
,我们总是伤害着又爱着像是做实验
,只为了你出现
,我也在做实验
,你也在做实验

,I'm sitting across from you
,Vibrations are streaming the emptiness in the room
,Melting all your words in my hand
,Tell me all the things that I am
,I wish that I could speak your perfect language
,I wish that we could travel to those places
,Where we're faceless and we're nameless
,Don't you don't you crave this
,I can feel the atmosphere unfolding
,Tell me if you pretty hearts worth holding
,I can feel the atmosphere unfolding
,Tell me if your pretty hearts
,I know you wanna hear me
,Turn down that blossom dearie
,And I try to speak to you in tongues
,But you're never here to see me right
,And I never seem to lose a run
,When we're following your stars at night
,See your lungs are never breathing right
,Your mother's never eaten right
,You see she never really won her fight
,She's handing me her torch to light
,Your fears and tribulations they are formed into a painting
,They are formed into a painting of us
,As I peer across the nation all your stars get to formation
,They are more than your creation of love
,And the rhythm of our are hearts are syncopated vindicated
,Leave our doubts to sleep right here
,Feel I wish that I could speak your perfect language
,I wish that we could travel to those places
,Where we're faceless and we're nameless
,Where we're dangerous don't you crave this
,I know you want to hear me
,Turn down that blossom dearie

,With a reflection
,Nobody wants
,To swim in the wind
,On a cloudy day
,And every message
,I traced
,Into the sand
,Got washed away washed away
,Sometimes
,My cries
,Sound like

,I'm frightened
,On so many levels
,I am an endless abyss
,I wish that you wanted to swim
,But i know that your bones
,Would
,Crack underneath
,The pressure
,Yet you still say
,That you wanna know me on a deeper level
,You can't swim
,Your love is land
,You're only searching for that buried treasure
,As if my secrets locked inside
,Could ever bring you any sort of pleasure
,I guess i forget
,You fell in love
,With the mountains
,I guess i forget you fell in love
,With the mountains

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,Stay stay stay stay stay
,Stay still untill they find it out

,Put the cold in my bones, watch as the fear is flown

,How could you be so cruel
,Yet so beautiful to me
,And in a year from now under that
,The thoughts of you will pass me by
,For every stain neither of us feeling better
,Do I find something new?
,Oh, keep so brand new, so brand new

,Too unaware to see the truth
,The loss of a girls wasted youth
,And you can't save her no more
,Uhh uhh
,And you can't save her no more
,Tough as diamonds
,Soft as silk
,She's as pure as devils milk
,She's a product
,Of the party
,That is done
,Another notch
,On her bed
,She forgets the times she said
,That when sex becomes a habit
,It's no fun
,Crossing the line between love and lust
,The only difference here is the heartache
,And the utter lack of trust
,And you can't save her no more

Like Cleopatra got the masses at my feet
Got a living dwell down on easy street
I'm the latest craze
And if you stay a while
Inevitably, you gone be biting my style
In your later days (well, well, well)
Let me tell you what is fact and what is true
I get high and that ain’t that much to do
I'm always in a daze (uh huh)

Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well

I'm further behind now than I was back then
Lost in some old maze (uh huh)

I'll get it together some other day

In my dreams I dwell
Cause all my dreams are swell
You would too
If you could see them
That's what I know
I gotta go
Get up
Get out and (yeah)

,Lo so che finirà
,Ho sempre un chiodo fisso nella testa
,Si lo so che tutto questo non è giusto
,Ma prima o poi succederà
,E ci saranno giorni senza sole
,Senza più parole
,Lo So che finirà
,e sarà forte il mio dolore per questo grande amore
,Lo so che finirà
,Il tuo sorriso e questo mi farà impazzire
,E quando poi mi mancheranno gli occhi tuoi
,Proverò a cercarli e poi fuggire
,Non ci saranno notti per amare
,Nemmeno per sognare
,Ma un vento forte il tempo e tutto quanto cancellerà
,Sarai un vecchio amore
,Per me non finiranno mai
,quegli annni amari
,Ci sono giorni dentro te da ricordare
,Ci sarà sempre il tuo passato nel futuro
,Che non potrò capire
,Se a te quel vecchio amore non ti fa più male
,A me mi fa soffrire
,Lo so che finirà
,Ma resterà per sempre una canzone
,Sarà un ricordo per stampare il nostro amore per non avere fine
,Ma se dovrà finire
,E a chi dirò ti amo tanto da morire
,poi lo dovrà sapere
,Che questa vecchia storia è stata scritta con dolore
,Dal principe del cuore
,Per me non finiranno mai
,quegli annni amari
,Ci sono giorni dentro te da ricordare
,Ci sarà sempre il tuo passato nel futuro
,Che non potrò capire
,Se a te quel vecchio amore non ti fa più male
,A me mi fa soffrire
,Ci sarà sempre il tuo passato nel futuro
,Che non potrò capire

Des yeux qui font baiser les miens 
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche 
Voila le portrait sans retouche 
De l’homme auquel j’appartiens 

Quand il me prend dans ses bras 
Je vois la vie en rose 
ll me dit des mots d’amour 
Des mots de tous les jours 
Et ca me fait quelque chose  
ll est entre dans mon coeur 
Une part de bonheur 
Dont je connais la cause 

C’est lui pour moi  
Moi pour lui 
Dans la vie 
ll me l’a dit,l’a jure 
Pour la vie 
Des que je l’apercois 
Alors je me sens en moi 
Mon coeur qui bat 

Des nuits d’amour plus finir 
Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place 
Les ennuis,les chagrins trepassent 
Heureux,heureux a en mourir 

Quand il me prend dans ses bras 
Je vois la vie en rose 
ll me dit des mots d’amour 
Des mots de tous les jours 
Et ca me fait quelque chose 
ll est entre dans mon coeur 
Une part de bonheur 
Dont je connais la cause

,There's no one there to meet me - and your clothes are on the floor
,Sorry if I hurt you - and I made you cry
,Couldn't stand to see you - with another guy
,It's the bluest blues - and it cuts me like a knife
,It's the bluest blues - since you walked out of my life
,Couldn't really tell you - how you hurt my pride
,Something broke within me - down inside
,I never knew I loved you - till you went away
,Now the loneliness surrounds me - everyday
,It's the bluest blues - since you walked out of the door
,It's the bluest blues - cause I won't see you no more
,I'm sorry if I failed you - if somehow I'm to blame
,It's the bluest blues I'm feeling - it's a crying shame
,I just can't live without you - face another day
,It's the bluest blues I'm feeling, and it's here to stay
,It's the bluest blues, and it cuts me to the bone
,It's the bluest blues, when you can't find your way home

,Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
,The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
,Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
,Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
,The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
,Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
,But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
,Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
,Oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
,Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
,See she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
,Lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
,Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
,For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
,Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
,Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
,Standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
,Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
,And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
,Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
,Oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
,Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
,Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
,Lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alone

,We walks along the river in the quiet summer night
,She said if you remembers when we parted long ago

,Well, I’ve never been a man of many words,
,and there’s nothing I could say that you haven’t heard.
,But I‘ll sing you love songs till the day I die.
,The way I’m feeling,
,I can’t keep it inside.
,I’ll sing a sweet serenade whenever you’re feeling sad,
,and a lullaby each night before you go to bed.
,I’ll sing to you for the rest of your life.
,The way I’m feeling,  I can’t keep it inside.
,No, I can't keep it inside.
,
,The sun has left and forgotten me
,It's dark, I cannot see
,Why does this rain pour down?
,I'm gonna drown
,In a sea...of deep confusion
,Somebody told me - I don't know who
,Whenever you are sad and blue
,And you're feejin' all alone and left behind
,Just take a look inside and you will find
,You gotta hold on, hold on through the night
,Hang on, things will be all right
,Even when it's dark
,And not a bit of sparkling
,Sing-song sunshine from above
,Spreading rays of sunny love - just
,Hang on, hang on to the vine
,Stay on, soon you'll be divine
,If you start to cry, look up to the sky
,Something's coming up ahead
,To turn your tears to dew instead
,And so I hold on to this advice
,When change is hard and not so nice
,If you listen to your heart the whole night through
,Your sunny somedav will come one dav soon to you

  Sitting down by my window,
 Whoa, whoa, looking at the rain.
 Whoa, down by my window, baby,
 And all around me,

 Somethin' grabbed a hold of me, darling,
 Honey, it felt to me, honey like, yeah, a ball and chain.

 Every time I want to reach out my hand.

 Never, never, no, no, no.
 Here you gone today, but I wanted to love you, darling,
 Oh, till the end of time,

 Love's got a hold on me baby
 Feels like a ball and chain.
 Oh, love just draggin' me down, yeah yeah yeah,
 Feels like, honey sometimes it feels honey like a ball, yeah like a ball and a chain
 Wonder why when I did the very best I could to love you
 You wanted to leave me here, honey in so much pain
 Come on, honey, I want you to tell me, please, yeah.
 Say oh, oh, oh, oh,
 Honey this can't be
 No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no yeah.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa
 Honey, this can't be just because I want to want you
 Does this mean I have to hide to cry, cry all the time ?
 I just wanted to love you, darling,
 Every day, oh, whoa, till the, to the very end, to the end of time,
 Yeah, no no no no no, hit it!
 Love's got a hold on me, baby,
 Feels like a ball and chain.

 Seems like anything, it could be the telephone company man,

 Over on the other side, say, not quite got it right this very minute.
 I'm so sorry babe, I said I'm so very sorry babe,
 But I never did promise you nothing, right ? I see what you mean.
 Come on, man, now come on, that ain't the name of it,
 And that ain't the end of it, you know what I mean.
 Sometimes, it feels just about breaking things, you know what I mean.
 Just like, just like a grave, just like a grave to call
 Just like a cry to call.
 Honey I never understood and I said please
 Lord, I swear I never understood and I say please
 I want you to help me, fill it up baby,
 I want you to help me, I said allow me to hear
 Please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
 Honey make me understand why love just feels so heavy on me, darling,
 Feels so bad on my back, babe,
 Feels just like a ball,
 Feels like a ball, ball, oh daddy feels like a ball,
 And a chain.

,立つ街角、消えてく足跡 最後にもう1度言うよ「ありがとう」
,今では色あせない この思い出
,サヨナラの前に謝りたいよ 素直になれなくてゴメンねと
,強がることでカッコつけてた私を どうか 許して…

,今も 消えてなくならない
,春の晴れた日の午後
,人見知りで みんなの輪に馴染めない 私のこと
,優しさとジョークでほどいてくれたのが
,二人の始まり。
,低い声 大きな歩幅
,映画みた時の涙 意外だった。
,そんな君の仕草のすべて
,愛おしく感じたDAY BY DAY
,（それなのに）まるで陽だまりみたいな日々に
,突然の終焉のチャイム
,あまりに急な告白だった
,思わず呼吸を失った…
,春の風と匂いに 君を想い出して…
,辛くなるほどに大好きだった
,あの日の「さよなら」の意味が
,「ありがとう」に変わった
,君を忘れないよ…
,君は「幸せ」ってだけで泣けること
,教えてくれた、初めての人。
,君は恋を愛に変えてくれた初めての人。
,一日の終わりのTELだけじゃ足りなくて
,「おやすみ」のメールもしてる
,そんな風にふたりで でも手探りで
,「愛」という名の花 育てたはずなのに…
,あの日そっと聞かせてくれた夢
,「叶う日まで見届けるね!」って
,照れながらした約束は
,もう果たされないままで、
,君の匂いも 髪を撫でてくれた細い指も
,過去のものにしなきゃいけないの?
,袖にしがみついて うつむいた…
,春の風と匂いに 君を想い出して…
,辛くなるほどに大好きだった
,あの日の「さよなら」の意味が
,「ありがとう」に変わった
,君を忘れないよ…
,忙しい毎日に 身体をまかせて
,忘れようとした そんな時もあった
,あと少しだけ大人に （Ah） なれた時には
,また笑顔を見せれたらいいなぁ
,がんばって言えた「またね」って
,だけどホントは今のままで
,同じ未来をみたい そばで
,「愛」が膨らみすぎて「甘え」
,それで、お別れ。
,日々忙しくしていれば
,痛みは少しずつ癒えたけど、
,想い出は 一つも消えない
,何一つも消えない
,春の風と匂いに 君を想い出して…
,辛くなるほどに大好きだった
,あの日の「さよなら」の意味が
,「ありがとう」に変わった
,君を忘れないよ…
,春の風と匂いに 君を想い出して…
,辛くなるほどに大好きだった
,あの日の「さよなら」の意味が
,「ありがとう」に変わった
,君を忘れないよ…

,My hearts beating for you like a samba

,Both Sides Now
,- Judy Collins
,
,Rows and floes of angel hair
,And ice cream castles in the air
,And feather canyons everywhere
,I`ve looked at clouds that way
,
,But now they only block the sun
,They rain and snow on everyone
,So many things I would have done
,But clouds got in my way
,
,I`ve looked at clouds from both sides now
,From up and down, and still somehow
,It`s cloud illusions I recall
,I really don`t know clouds at all
,(-------- Misic --------)
,Moons and junes and ferris wheels
,The dizzy dancing way you feel
,As every fairy tale comes real
,I`ve looked at love that way
,
,But now it`s just another show
,You leave them laughing when you go
,And if you care, don`t let them know
,Don`t give yourself away
,
,I`ve looked at love from both sides now
,From give and take, and still somehow
,It`s loves illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,Tears and fears and feeling proud
,To say I love you right out loud
,Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
,I`ve looked at life that way
,
,But now old friends are acting strange
,They shake their heads,They say I`ve changed
,Somethings lost
,Somethings gainedIn living every day
,
,I`ve looked at life from both sides now
,From win and lose and still somehow
,It`s lifes illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,
,And now the purple dusk of twilight time
,Steals across the meadows of my heart
,High up in the sky the little stars climb
,Always reminding me that we're apart
,You wander down the lane and far away
,Leaving me a song that will not die
,Love is now the stardust of yesterday
,The music of the years gone by
,Sometimes I wonder why I spend
,The lonely night dreaming of a song
,The melody haunts my reverie
,And I am once again with you
,When our love was new
,And each kiss an inspiration
,But that was long ago
,Now my consolation
,Is in the stardust of a song
,Beside a garden wall
,When stars are bright
,You are in my arms
,The nightingale tells his fairy tale
,A paradise where roses bloom
,Though I dream in vain
,in my heart it always will remain
,My stardust melody
,The memory of love's refrain
,
,
,Feelin' low
,Rockin' slow
,I want to go
,Right back where I belong
,Way down south in Birmingham
,I mean south in Alabam' s
,There's an old place where people go
,To dance the night away
,They all drive or walk for miles
,To get jive that southern style
,It's an old jive that makes you want
,To dance till break of day
,It's a junction where the town folks meet
,At each function in a tux they greet you
,Come on down, forget your care
,Come on down, you'll find me there
,So long town, I'm heading for
,Tuxedo Junction now

,When tears are in your eyes.
,I will dry them all.
,I’m on your side,
,when times get rough,
,And friends just can’t be found,

,Just like a star across my sky
,Just like an angel off the page
,You have appeared to my life
,Feel like I'll never be the same
,Just like a song in my heart
,Just like oil on my hands
,Oh.. I do love you
,
,Still I wonder why it is
,I don't argue like this
,With anyone but you
,We do it all the time
,Blowing out my mind
,
,You've got this look I can't describe
,You make me feel like I'm alive
,When everything else is a fade
,Without a doubt you're on my side
,Heaven has been away too long
,Can't find the words to write this song
,Oh.
,Your love

,Just like a song in my heart
,Just like oil on my hands

,Yet like a child I yearn for you?How can I think I'm standing strong,
,Yet feel the air beneath my feet?
,How can happiness fell so wrong?
,How can misery feel so sweet?
,How can you let me watch you sleep,
,Then break my dreams the way you do?
,How can I have got in so deep?
,Why did I fall in love with you?
,This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been.
,Feeling twenty-two,acting seventeen.
,This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known.
,I was never crazy on my own.
,And now I know that there's a link between the two.
,Being close to craziness and being close to you.
,......
,How can you make me fall apart
,Then break my fall with loving lies?
,It's so easy to break a heart.
,It's so easy to close yuor eyes.
,How can you treat me like a child
,How can anyone feel so wild?
,How can anyone feel so blue?
,This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been.

,For you I was a flame,
,Love is a losing game
,Five story fire as you came,
,Love is losing game
,
,One I wished I never played,
,Oh, what a mess we made
,And now the final frame,
,Love is a losing game
,
,Played out by the band,
,Love is a losing hand
,More than I could stand,
,Love is a losing hand
,
,Self professed profound
,Til' the chips were down
,Know you're a gambling man
,Love is a losing hand
,
,Though I'm battled blind
,Love is a fate resigned
,Memories mar my mind,
,Love it is a fate resigned
,
,Over futile odds,
,And laughed at by the Gods
,And now the final frame,
,Love is a losing game

,We touched the wall＇s of the city streets and,
,Didn＇t explain,
,Sadly showed us our ways,
,
,Of never asking why?
,
,Cast down it was heaven sent （and）,
,To the church no intent to repent,
,On my knees,
,
,Just to cry.
,Until you travel to that,

,Burning nights, he＇s coming to me and,
,Someway, he＇ll punish my deeds,
,And he＇ll find,
,All the crimes.
,
,But then they ask, when they gunna see them,
,Then they gunna ask to feel,
,The ghost, the walls, the dreams,
,Well I＇ve got mine.
,
,At last, those coming came and,
,
,They never looked back,
,
,With blinding stars in their eyes,
,But all they saw was black.
,
,Fooled them,
,Hoping to seem like a sliver of evil,
,But the part agreed and,
,It＇s not a mask,
,So be honest with me,
,We can＇t afford to ignore,
,That I＇m the disease.
,Practical, since we had to be in,
,When they were all looking back to me,
,And they tried,
,Oh they tried.

,And when you follow through,
,And wind up on your back,
,Looking at up at those stars in the sky,
,Those white clouds have turned it black.

,Mine was a blue world
,until you came along
,thought I was through
,Singing a melanchoy song
,Now the tune is the same
,And every word's coming true
,Guess that'the danger
,in loving you
,Just like a silly moth
,That can't seem to learn
,I keep running back
,Although I know it's gonna burn
,Sometimes I hate myself
,But what can i do
,I'm drawn to the danger
,And loving you
,I can't fight your devil charms
,When you take me in your arms
,And you lead me into harm's way
,I'm a captive in the game you play
,I can't fight your devil charms
,When you take me in your arms
,And you lead me into harm's way
,I'm a captive in the game you play
,I'm like a gambler
,In this round of roulette
,'Cept it's my heart
,That I've got riding on a bet
,How long will it take
,Before you break it in two
,It's all in the danger in loving you
,It's all in the danger in loving you
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
,And to reach the highest peak,
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek,
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you;
,The charm about you
,Will carry me thro' to Heaven
,I'm in Heaven,
,and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Come on and Dance with me, i want my arms about you
,That charm about you
,Will carry me through
,Right up to Heaven, I'm in Heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing
,Out together dancing
,When we're out together dancing
,Cheek to cheek
,Oh, yeah!
,
,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old Winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling

,If Pirus and Crips all got along
,They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
,Seem like the whole city go against me
,Every time I'm in the street I hear
,"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"
,"Man down
,Where you from, nigga?"
,"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
,"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
,This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
,Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
,This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
,This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
,Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
,It was Me, O-Boog, and Yaya, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
,It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self
,Uh, warriors and Conans
,Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
,The driver seat the first one to get killed
,Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
,At the same burger stand, where hang out
,Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
,But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
,That was back when I was nine
,Joey packed the nine
,Pakistan on every porch is fine
,We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
,With the sliding door, fuck is up?
,Fuck you shootin for if you ain't walkin up?
,You fuckin punk, pickin up the fuckin pump
,Pickin off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
,Or warn the bullets comin from
,AK's, AR's, "aye y'all. Duck."
,That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
,Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
,You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
,Now crawl yo head in that noose
,You wind up dead on the news
,Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
,BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
,IV's on top of IV's
,Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
,When you hop on that trolley
,Make sure your colors correct
,Make sure you're cornbread, or they'll be calling your mother collect
,They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
,When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
,You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep wit a Tec
,Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
,M.A.A.d city
,"Man down
,Where you from, nigga?"
,"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?"
,"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
,This m.A.A.d city like, "Run, my nigga."
,If Pirus and Crips all got along
,They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
,Seem like the whole city go against me
,Every time I'm in the street I hear
,"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!
,Wake yo punk ass up!
,It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
,Chyea
,Real simple and plain
,I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
,It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
,Chyea
,How we do
,Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
,Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
,Reality struck I seen the white car crash
,Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
,My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
,Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
,In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
,To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
,Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
,Cocaine laced in marijuana
,And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
,Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
,I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
,I made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding
,You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
,Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
,Cocaine, weed
,Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
,Shine sticks, buck nakeds
,Make a nigga flip
,Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
,One time's crooked and shit
,Block a nigga in
,Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
,I'm still in the hood
,Loc yeah that's cool
,The hood took me under so I follow the rules
,But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
,And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
,Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
,A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
,Couple of IV's with the fucking spraycan
,Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
,Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
,Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
,Mount up regulators in the whip
,Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
,Trip, we in the hood still
,So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
,Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
,And a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand
,If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
,Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
,With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
,If I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
,Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
,And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
,With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
,Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
,Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
,They realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins
,Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
,That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
,They bang it and slide out that bitch with the pies
,And the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects
,I live inside the belly of the rough
,Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what
,Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
,She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs

,Okay, back when I was sleepin’ in my mama’s crib
,Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
,Payin’ seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
,No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
,Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
,Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
,Childish shit, you know childish shit
,Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
,Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
,Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
,The same clubs I used to get tossed out

,You are appreciated
,When I was young me and my mama had beef
,Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
,Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
,Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
,Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
,with the big boys, breakin all the rules
,I shed tears with my baby sister
,Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
,And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
,When things went wrong we'd blame mama
,I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
,Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
,And who'd think in elementary?
,Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
,And runnin from the police, that's right
,Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
,And even as a crack fiend, mama
,You always was a black queen, mama
,I finally understand
,for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
,You always was committed
,A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
,There's no way I can pay you back
,But the plan is to show you that I understand
,You are appreciated
,Lady...
,Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady
,Dear mama
,Place no one above ya, sweet lady
,You are appreciated
,Don't cha know we love ya?
,Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
,No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
,He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
,wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
,They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
,I was lookin for a father he was gone
,I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
,They showed a young brother love
,I moved out and started really hangin
,I needed money of my own so I started slangin
,I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
,It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
,I love payin rent when the rent's due
,I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
,Cause when I was low you was there for me
,And never left me alone because you cared for me
,And I could see you comin home after work late
,You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
,Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
,And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
,But now the road got rough, you're alone
,You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
,And there's no way I can pay you back
,But my plan is to show you that I understand
,You are appreciated
,Lady...
,Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady
,Dear mama
,Place no one above ya, sweet lady
,You are appreciated
,Don't cha know we love ya?
,Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama
,I can always depend on my mama
,And when it seems that I'm hopeless
,You say the words that can get me back in focus
,When I was sick as a little kid
,To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
,And all my childhood memories
,Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
,And even though I act craaazy
,I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
,There are no words that can express how I feel
,You never kept a secret, always stayed real
,And I appreciate, how you raised me
,And all the extra love that you gave me
,I wish I could take the pain away
,If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
,Everything will be alright if ya hold on
,It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
,And there's no way I can pay you back
,But my plan is to show you that I understand
,You are appreciated
,Lady...
,Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady
,Dear mama
,Place no one above ya, sweet lady
,You are appreciated
,Don't cha know we love ya?

,I Ain’t No Joke - Eric B  &amp; Rakim
,
,I ain&apos;t no joke  I used to let the mic smoke
,Now I slam it when I&apos;m done
,And make sure it&apos;s broke
,When I&apos;m gone  no one gets on cause I won&apos;t let
,Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
,I like to stand in a crowd
,And watch the people wonder damn
,But think about it then you&apos;ll understand
,I&apos;m just an addict  addicted to music
,Maybe it&apos;s a habit  I gotta use it
,Even if it&apos;s jazz or the quiet storm
,I hook a beat up  convert it into hip-hop form
,Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
,Deep concentration cause I&apos;m no comedian
,Jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
,I treat you like a child then you&apos;re gonna be named
,Another enemy  not even a friend of me
,Cause you&apos;ll get fried in the end
,When you pretend to be
,Competing cause I just put your mind on pause
,And I can beat you
,When you compare my rhyme with yours
,I wake you up and as I stare in
,Your face you seem stunned
,Remember me  the one you got your idea from
,But soon you start to suffer
,The tune&apos;ll get rougher
,When you start to stutter
,That&apos;s when you had enough of
,Biting it will make you choke  you can&apos;t provoke
,You can&apos;t cope  you should have broke
,Because I ain&apos;t no joke
,
,I got a question as serious as cancer
,
,Who can keep the average dancer
,Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
,Cause you&apos;re expressing the rhyme that I&apos;m styling
,This is what we all sit down to write
,You can&apos;t make it so you take it home  break it and bite
,Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
,Get the style down pat then it&apos;s time to switch
,Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
,Then you figure you&apos;re ready for the neighborhood tours
,The E-M-C-E-E don&apos;t even try to be
,When you come up to speak  don&apos;t even lie to me
,You like to exaggerate  dream and imaginate
,Then change the rhyme around
,That can aggravate me
,So when you see me  come up  freeze
,Or you&apos;ll be one of those seven emcees
,They think that I&apos;m a new jack but only if they knew that
,They who think wrong are they who can&apos;t do that
,Style that I&apos;m doing  they might ruin
,Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
,Your offbeat DJ  if anything he play
,Sound familiar  I&apos;ll wait til E say
,Play &apos;em  so I&apos;m a have to dis and broke
,You could get a smack for this
,I ain&apos;t no joke
,
,I hold the microphone like a grudge
,B&apos;ll hold the record so the needle don&apos;t budge
,I hold a conversation cause when I invent
,I nominated my DJ the president
,When I emcee  I&apos;ll keep a freestyle  going steadily
,So pucker up and whistle my melody
,But whatever you do  don&apos;t miss one
,They&apos;ll be another rough rhyme after this one
,Before you know it  you&apos;re following and fiending
,Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
,Like before the middle of my story I&apos;m telling
,Nobody beats the R  so stop yelling
,Save it  put it in your pocket for later
,Cause I&apos;m moving the crowd and B a record fader
,No interruptions and the mic is broke
,When I&apos;m gone  then you can joke
,Cause everything is real on a serious tip
,Keep playing and I get furious quick
,And I&apos;ll take you for a walk through hell
,Freeze your dome  then watch your eyeballs swell
,Guide you out of triple stage darkness
,When it get dark again then I&apos;m a spark this
,Microphone cause the heat is on  you see smoke
,And I&apos;m finished when the beat is gone
,I&apos;m no joke

, It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky
, I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
, Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
, These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
, Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said "It's not that easy"

, It's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky
, In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
, They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
, And in the city it's a pity cos we just can't hide
, Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside
, It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
, It's Tricky...(How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
, It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
, It's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!
, When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
, I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cos I make up a rhyme
, I'm not braggin', people naggin' cos they think I'm a star
, Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
, A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play
, Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
, I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cos I'm on TV
, They even bother my poor father cos he's down with me
, It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
, It's Tricky...(How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
, It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
, It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...
, We are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
, They offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
, It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
, You keep on (rock!) shock! Cos this is it...

,But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
,Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
,To make moves again, stomp and bruise again

,
,I've been sitting right here
,locked in my room all through the night, trying to write
,every second of my life in this mic
,it's been a fight, just to get 'em to listen and pay attention
,punching 'till my knuckles are bleeding, ain't made dent
,not to mention, ain't got a dollar to my name
,just living gig to gig, straight caught up in the fame
,sleeping in my car, hoping to sell a disc
,'cause you're wanting it so bad you're tasting it on your lips
,get a pen and paint a picture
,of the pain and pull the ladder
,of this pitter patter, people poking jabs
,oh well, it doesn't matter
,'cause this hurt won't all be forever
,I'm keeping my head high and hoping for the better
,when everything's down and out, under the weather
,and every first round you're out, stuck in the shredder
,yeah, claim to have friends but they're never around
,so you keep moving on, one man and a crowd
,this is my day, this is my night
,this is my pain, this is my life
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,every new day, every new night
,every new stage, every new fight
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,this is what I'm made for
,every single moment that I'm living I can feel it on the stage floor
,you don't know the half of half of what I've given
,to make it up to this level, every day at home spitting
,every day alone wishing, while every roads shifting
,and every cold wind is getting heavy, road slipping
,every day, might be your last chance to make it
,every day I'm seeing less cash on the bank slip
,grasp and get anxious, rap like it's ancient
,give them something that they've never had from this basement
,show them what you're made of, just tell 'em straight up
,you can go and take on the world, what you afraid of?
,yes, it's right around the bend
,it's a first round knockout, let the rounds begin
,no need to count to ten, we can count the win
,and you can count on me to knock out every sound I'm in
,this is my day, this is my night
,this is my pain, this is my life
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,every new day, every new night
,every new stage, every new fight
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,fall to my knees every night and I pray
,asking Lord let 'em hear, I got something to say
,there's a fear out there and it's coming your way
,don't let it stop you from living for what you were made
,it's not dream it's destiny, blessed is he
,when this whole world listens to this mess in me
,there's a message inside, what you get from me
,a little life, little love, that's the recipe
,so when the world is crashing down and you feel the weight on your shoulders
,try to pick it up but you're steady stacking up boulders
,every days a gift, never miss it, getting older
,blessing in the struggle know that you're just on the road to
,a life you were born to live
,so I wake up every day and just give it what I'm born to give
,everything in me, and nothing less
,while this hearts still beating up inside my chest
,this is my day, this is my night
,this is my pain, this is my life
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,every new day, every new night
,every new stage, every new fight
,this is what I was born to do
,I was born to do
,I was born to do
,I was born to do
,Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
,I’ll be right there for you
,Tell me what to say, don’t matter if it’s true
,I’ll say it all for you
,I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
,
,Why am I so differently wired ? Am I a martian ?
,What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
,Because I belong in this world
,That’s why I’m scoffing at authority, defying often
,Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
,So I’m non complying at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
,
,And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
,Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
,
,Thinking he can try and solve them
,I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
,And in the front drive talking to myself
,Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
,
,Trying not to be noticed because I’m crying and sobbing
,I had a bad day at school so I ain’t talking
,Some cocksucker shoved me into a fvcking locker
,Because he said I eyeballed him
,And if you fall, ill get you there
,I’ll be your savior from all the wars that are fought inside your world
,
,Please have faith in my words
,Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me looking overseas
,This is my legacy, legacy legacy, legacy
,I used to be the type of kid would always think the sky is falling
,
,Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?
,‘Cuz sporadic as my thoughts come, it’s mind boggling
,‘Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it’s small shit
,Bothers me but now my father, he said Sayonara, then split but I don’t give a shit.
,
,I’m fine along as theirs batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
,
,Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
,I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment complex on a ten speed which
,
,
,I’ve acquired parts I found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it,
,
,Headphones on straight ahead and kids try to start shit,
,But if this all there is for me Life offers
,Why bother even try and put up a fight It's nonsense
,But i think a lightbulb just lit up in my conscience
,What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
,They are kinda giving me confidence
,Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
,Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
,
,Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
,
,Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
,Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
,
,I could be iconic, and my conquest is
,Word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest ...
,Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh
,There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me looking overseas
,This is my legacy, legacy legacy, legacy
,I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is falling
,
,Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
,Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
,Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
,And use my enemy's words as strength
,To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
,Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
,By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
,Now you shut up bitch I am talking
,Thought I was full of horseshit and now
,You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
,Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
,Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
,So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
,It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
,Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers
,You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
,With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
,You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
,Suck a dick The day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
,And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
,The most high exalting and I ain't halting
,Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
,The best part about me is I am not you
,I am me I'm a fire marshall and this is my
,Because… This is my legacy, legacy ehhhhh

春节过去，才脱掉棉衣
抬眼望枝头何时才能发绿
一年之计，一心想要如意
左手是希望
右手攥着一把小米

日出大地，驱散困意
红薯和高粱匆匆埋进土里
一场春雨，一片生机盎然
你的眼神
若有所忆若有所思

阴天下雨，晴天霹雳
命运把无常写进你的眼底
一边怀疑，一边要鼓起勇气
你说爱人
这个冬天就要远去

睁开眼是理想，闭上眼是理想
吃的是理想，咽下的是理想
笑容是理想，泪水也都是理想

开口是理想，闭口还是理想
收获是理想，种也种下理想
迷惘是理想，冲动也都是理想

我们是冠军，我们是冠军
我们是希望，我们是希望
我们是冠军。我们是冠军
笑容希望，泪水也都是希望

别让眼前的一叶
遮蔽你的目光
别让这儿的一切
左右你的思想

你说你不想摇摆
可是太多无奈
你说你不能重来
只因害怕失败
不再冲动的年代
不能随便感慨
承诺变得苍白该如何交待

你说你不再单纯
只因城府已深
你说你不再摇滚
只因入地无门
担心失去的人们
失去不曾停顿
别让“不再”占据你的灵魂

如果有一天世界是一片混乱
没有谁会在乎谁是否会有遗憾
这样吧，时间分裂之前
多一天，算一天

嘿嘿，早就该撕破了往日嘴脸
看看全都是过期作废誓言
为什么幸福靠近边缘
你一半，我一半

所有的抱怨都来自这失控的房间
所有的爱情都熄灭在一瞬间
我不能控制你消失在沉默里
我在你身边已变得不新鲜

醒来，我试图掩饰我失眠后的疲倦
我用祈祷的双眼盼望又是一个艳阳天
匆匆的行人，一样拥挤的清晨

某人，我知道离去后你不会再回来
都是擦肩而过的男女，穿梭在各自的幻想里
不必为我愧疚，也不必为谁停留

今夜，银锭桥的四面爱情正在上演
我可以看见灯火把喧闹彻夜点亮
让我在这狂野，让我在孤单里孤单

醒来，我再次抛开我失眠后的疲倦
哦，我依旧祈祷还是一个艳阳天
空空的房间，一样对你的思念

秋天，在金色麦田里把昨天掩埋
我用身体亲吻大地，让四肢慢慢伸展
泛黄的青春，少年和遍地香泽兰

今夜，朝阳路的尽头末班车已走远
我可以看见自己被街灯拉长的身影
失魂的长夜，盛开的十里香泽兰

狂奔在路上
你知道我的惆怅
用我对你的思念
赐予我力量
可我难辨这方向
唯有徘徊
挥舞手中长枪
刺不中偏见
我渴望追寻这闪电
随命运扶弱锄强

平静中酝酿
黎明前的风浪
长夜不能入眠
只为守护希望
我与魔鬼纠缠
与风车作战
围城中深陷
思念来疗伤
我渴望追寻这永恒
追寻骑士的一生

借我巨人的双手把这纷乱的世界变成雕塑
喧闹的欲望的机车，在狂舞时分停步
荒山，废弃的村庄，拥挤的城市联排别墅

借我上帝的眼眸把这模糊的世界看个清楚
森林和城市的交界，有延绵百里的迷雾
我无力地望着远方，谁能开启这一扇门

充满迷雾的街道，没有人为我引路
充满欢笑的城市，没有人再去愤怒
清晨和夜幕的轮回，迷雾将清醒包围
再见吧街上的人们，明天依然不知所措

我要巨人的双手把这纷乱的世界变成雕塑
我要上帝的眼眸把这模糊的世界看得清楚
为徘徊在街上的人们，为你我拨开迷雾

老实先生靠在沙发
疲倦写满他脸上
哦，明天是怎样一天
答案其实他很清楚
他谈过几次恋爱
如今还是他一个人
他渴望的生活
和所有人一样
只是需要依靠命运太多的袒护

哦—嘿
老实并不是你的错误
哦—嘿
现实是梦的坟墓
哦—嘿
祈祷有上帝保佑
哦—嘿
打开你灵魂之门

老实先生握着电话
希望写满他脸上
哦，传来熟悉的声音
结果还是依然如初
重复就是人生
“老实”这样安慰自己
他渴望一切改变
改变需要太多的勇气

哦—嘿
老实并不是你的错误
哦—嘿
现实是梦的坟墓
哦—嘿
祈祷有上帝保佑
哦—嘿
开启吧天堂之门

我有一座房子
守护在碧水河畔
在房间的中央
铺满羊毛地毯
望着天花板发呆
我该做点什么

我有一座房子
每天有太多宾客
不必我招呼
随意穿过房间
人潮聚散的夜晚
我该睡哪一张床

刺骨的风
穿透了我的衣衫
我蜷缩着身体
盼望着春天
在房间的四面
开满红蔷薇花
望着大桥的两岸
等爱我的人出现

我这儿不在这吗

昨天晚上在CD Blues（熙地布鲁斯）
我是真的没喝多
他们说你喝得转着圈找
抱着酒瓶不撒手
他们说你喝得断片了
睡得像只死狗
可没人能知道
我的心里有多难受
她跟我说爱我
一辈子都跟我过
还随时随地提醒我
我是她的帅哥
你说你给她买了车
还每天送玫瑰花朵
我给她的爱
她从来不嫌多
她说一辈子都跟我过
她真是这么说
她真的这么说
可我昨天才知道
她跟别人也这么说
一瓶二锅头
两瓶嘉兴酒
三瓶tequila(龙舌兰）
听说还加了四圈伏特加
我是真的没喝多
你还说你没喝多
真的没喝多
我只是心里难受
想找人

掏掏心窝子

,Ahh~
,Listen,
,He got older, but never grew,
,For his life he can't tell the truth.
,How to love he ain't got a clue,
,Playing games like he'll never lose you.
,Try to talk to him, can't get through,
,Every day he's a different dude.
,These are the signs of a grown ass boy,
,Better run for the hills, I'm just trying to keep it real.
,You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
,You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
,Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
,Cause you can't raise a man, no, no.
,Coming home any time at night, expecting you to let it ride
,How many tears are you gonna cry?
,Playing games like he'll never lose you
,You know that the love is changed, how many times he called you out your name?
,These are the signs of a grown ass boy,
,Better run for the hills, I'm just keeping it real.
,You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
,You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
,Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
,You can't raise a man, no, no.
,Gonna take more than a miracle to change him, just let him go.
,Tell me when will you decide to do better with your life.
,If his momma couldn't do it what makes you think
,You can train a boy to be a man, it's too late.
,Better off letting him go, no matter how hard you try you can't raise.
,You can't raise a man, he's already grown, what you gonna do?
,You wonder why he acts like a boy. If he wasn't raised right before you
,Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody, if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody.
,Cause you can't raise a man, no, no.

,Tell me what you see
,A scared little boy
,who looks just like me
,Kinda hard to explain
,All the joy and the pain
,Now I'm questioning everything
,That was told to me
,(Why) Did you love me before I loved you?
,(Why) Are the mercies forever brand new?
,Just trying to figure out what you gave me
,I wanna know everything from A to Z
,I wanna know why you died just to save me
,I wanna know if what you say is true
,I wanna know when I pray can you hear me?
,I wanna know if what I feel is you
,A thousand things that I can't explain
,Like before I was born you knew my first name
,Like the honey needs a bee, like a flower needs a seed
,Now I'm questioning everything that was told to me
,(Why) do the birds sing?
,(Why) are the leaves green?
,(Why) is the ocean blue?
,(Why) did you call me- give me the gift to sing
,These are the questions that I have for you
,I wanna know, I wanna know if what you say is true
,I wanna know when I pray can you hear me?
,I wanna know if what I feel is you
,I wanna know why you died just to save me
,I wanna know if what you say is true

,Ooh
,Oooooh
,Sweet love
,Yeah
,I didn't mean it
,When I said I didn't love you so
,I should have held on tight
,I never should've let you go
,I did nothing
,I was stupid
,I was foolish
,I was lying to myself
,I could not fathom that I would ever
,Be without your love
,Never imagined I'd be
,Sitting here beside myself
,Cause I didn't know you
,Cause I didn't know me
,But I thought I knew everything
,I never felt
,The feeling that I'm feeling now
,Now that I don't hear your voice
,Or even touch or even kiss your lips
,Cause I don't have a choice
,What I wouldn't give
,To have you lying by my side
,Right here cause baby
,When you left I lost a part of me
,It's still so hard to believe
,Come back baby please
,Cause we belong together
,Who else am I gonna lean on
,When times get rough
,Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
,Till the sun comes up
,Who's gonna take your place
,Baby nobody else
,Oh baby baby we belong together
,I can't sleep at night
,When you're all on my mind
,Bobby Womack's on the radio
,Singing to me
,If you think you're lonely now
,Wait a minute
,This is too deep, too deep
,I gotta change the station
,So I turn the dial
,Trying to catch a break
,And then I hear Babyface
,I only think of you
,And it's breaking my heart
,I'm trying to keep it together
,But I'm falling apart
,I'm feeling all out of my element
,I'm throwing things
,Crying Trying to figure out
,Where the hell I went wrong
,The pain reflected in this song
,Ain't even half of what
,I'm feeling inside
,I need you need you back in my life baby
,When you left I lost a part of me
,It's still so hard to believe
,Come back baby please
,Cause we belong together
,Who else am I gonna lean on
,When times get rough
,Who's gonna talk to me
,Till the sun comes up
,Who's gonna take your place
,There ain't nobody else
,Oh baby baby we belong together baby
,When you left I lost a part of me
,It's still so hard to believe
,Come back baby please

,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin

,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,Now this is dedicated to the ones
,That lost their lives a little too early
,To the families out there still in pain
,I know that y'all are still hurtin'
,Losing loved ones, and ridas
,And sons no longer with us
,To the soldiers overseas
,Never coming home to they families
,We breathe but it really don't get no better
,They kinda went out too soon
,So much too live for still
,Just built a baby's room
,Last year he was the groom
,And now his soul is set free
,But still alive in your mind
,When you lay down to sleep
,They never really gone, take time like Cash said
,They livin' in our hearts
,I know it, I can feel him there
,They lookin' down upon us
,Guiding us through all the struggles
,Helping us to find all the pieces of the puzzle, yeah
,The pains double when it's someone so young
,But they gonna live through us
,So they can see how it's done, yeah
,All the tears, and the fun
,And everything in between
,We raise the glass in the air
,For the ones no longer seen
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,Life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
,Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
,The sharp knife of a short life, well
,Yeah, now I can't understand
,Why the Lord is taking these kids
,So many kidnappings and murders
,Right here right around where I live
,Let alone the rest of the world
,My heart goes out to that girl
,So R.I.P. little Caylee
,How could this happen to a baby?
,I get so sick of this place
,But I try to focus on the good
,But it's hard when you lose someone
,Way sooner than you probably should
,If I could, I'd take all the pain away
,No more funerals
,Or visting cemeteries on holidays
,I just wanna drift away
,From all the pain that we feelin'
,Man, it's been ten years
,Since Chris died, I'm still healin'
,One of the first dudes
,To push me in this rappin'
,I'll never forget, we shed so many tears
,So tragic, you and your brother passin'
,How could this happen?
,You still here though
,Everytime I'm layin' down a track
,Man, I gotta keep it crackin'
,I know this was your dream
,I do it for the ones that are no longer seen
,The sharp knife of a short life, well
,I've had, just enough time
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin
,Lay me down on a, bed of roses
,Sink me in the river, at dawn
,Send me away with the words of a love song
,If I die young, bury, bury me in satin

And stand around
'cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
So I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooo Shake it down

I will never, no, no never
Love again, ooh

Building my whole world around you

We loved each other
We just couldn't get along
Take a good look at me
I'm in misery, can't you see
The love I lost

But the good times we used to share, my love
I'm so sad and lonely
But without you my life is so dead
I'm sorry to say
You go your way and I'll go my way
It hurts deep inside
The day we said goodbye, but
The love I lost 
Was a sweet love

,I look, at you all, see the love, there that's sleeping,
,while my guitar, gently weeps.
,I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping,
,still my guitar, gently weeps.
,I don't know why, nobody told you,
,how to unfold your love.
,
,I don't know how, someone controlled you,
,they bought and sold you.
,I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning,
,while my guitar, gently weeps.
,With every mistake, we must surely, be learning,
,still my guitar, gently weeps
,
,I don't know how, you were diverted,
,you were perverted, too.
,I don't know how, you were inverted,
,no one alerted you.
,I look, at you all, see the love,
,there that's sleeping,

,Look at you all...

,As her car pulls out the driveway
,And she don’t wave goodbye
,Her last words echo in my mind
,Listen honey, i gotta get away
,I’m standing here watching her tail lights
,As if they’re some kind of sign
,Fading into a memory
,I just got tired of trying
,So long, i hate to see you go
,So i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i keep i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,Two days later i get a letter
,A picture of a room in some hotel
,Sitting framed up on the table,
,A picture i know so well
,You’ve painted yourself in to a corner
,Now you’re trying to paint something new
,And your lipstick on the letter
,Is a goodbye kiss from you
,So long, i hate to see you go
,but i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i keep i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,I still set the table
,Still set it for you and me
,It’s become a habit
,My own personal make believe
,
,So long, i hate to see you go
,but i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i kee? i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,So long, i hate to see you go
,but i save my tears for later on down the road
,How come i keep i holding on
,Knowing you won’t be coming home
,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end
,Always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
,
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know

,
,If you know love,
,

,
,The sun don't rise the same
,
,When a heart sings,
,
,like a moonbeam
,
,It shines on everything
,
,If I told you,
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,
,I could not lie, if I tried
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love
,
,The birds don't sound the same
,
,With your sweet smile
,
,going on for miles
,
,It warms up everything
,
,If ya told me,
,
,you were so sure
,
,You found out that love
,
,had come to town
,
,you don't second guess it,
,
,if you know love
,
,Cotton candy and summer nights
,
,String of pearls and city lights
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,Lazy river and light
,
,pretty thoubo dark come my eye
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love,
,
,the words won't sound the same
,
,I have stumbled
,
,I have wondered
,
,and found sweet happiness
,
,What if I told you
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,If you know love
,
,well no way yes second guess it
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know like I know love
,In the cool of the evening
,When everything is getting kind of Groovy
,You call me up and ask me
,Would I like to go with you and see a movie?
,First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight
,And then I stop and say all right
,Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
,You always keep me guessing
,I never seem to know what you are thinking
,And if a girl looks at you
,It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking
,I get confused, I never know where I stand
,And then you smile and hold my hand
,Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky
,If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are a playing
,I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's
,Just like a ghost you're a haunting my dreams
,Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you Spooky

,You say it's over and you're ready to move on
,You want to believe all the fire is gone
,But I feel some hesitation, even as you leave
,Think it through, what you gonna do about me?
,It hasn't always been easy, you and I both know
,But the easy way out, will be a hot way to go
,Do you think you can forget what we had so easily?
,Think it through, what you gonna do about me?
,You may go out and find another, but what you think you lookin for?
,You might think you found a lover, but you'll still be wanting something more
,When you close your eyes you might be surprised at who you're gonna see
,Oh baby, what you gonna do about me?
,So stop and think it over, baby, before you leave it all behind
,No matter where you go, no matter what you do
,I'll still be there in the back of the line
,When you close your eyes you might be surprised at who you gonna see
,Oh baby, what you gonna do about me?
,You might spend a lifetime fighting back my memory
,Now oh baby, what you gonna do about me?
,Oh, I want you to think it through
,What you gonna do, what you gonna do about me?
,Give me one reason to stay here'
,And I'll turn right back around.
,Give me one reason to stay here'

,Said I don't want leave you lonely'
,You got to make me change my mind.

,This youthful heart can love you and
,give you what you need.

作词 : Eckersley, Little
I knew the moment that I met you 
I would get you 
It seems that fate arranged our meeting 
when you came my way 
And though my actions seem unruly 
love you truelly 
To all the world I am repeating 
I've jut got to say 
I knew you were the one in the world 
the only one who knew 
that love and I are one in the world 
No one but you 
You got the moon, the sun and the world 
you took away the rain 
You made me feel what's real in the world 
built my castles in Spain 
My heart won't behave dear 
till you are mine 
For I am your weary slave dear 
I worship at your shrine 
Why there is what's done in the world 
whatever else there is to be 
I know your the one in the world 
for me

if you aren't a man with a lot of guts
a dog-gone woman will drive you nuts
you can't trust one to the corner now a day
you got to watch your doors
or she'll cheat you blind
a woman aren't got but a one track mind
you'll find out bud, it's the man who always pays
she'll feed you a line that will turn your head
and you'll marry her and when you're in bed
she'll go through all the pockets in your pants
and if you object there'll be a big fight
and chances are it will last all night
i'm telling you man you just aren't got a chance
never, never trust a woman
you'll be sorry if you do
never, never trust a woman
she'll just make a monkey out of you
though women are handy around the house
they can't be trusted by man nor mouse
it's a shame the way they drag a good man down
it's a well-known fact they talk too much
and they dig up dirt about the neighbors and such
and paul revere the gossip all around town
you'll blow your top when they get in your hair
and they'll drive you to drink and man i'll swear
you wish you never seen the light of day
i'm tipping you off your goose is cooked
when one of them females gets you hooked
and so you better think it over while you may
never, never trust a woman
you'll be sorry if you do
never, never trust a woman
she'll just make a monkey out of you
i'm telling you man it's a dirty shame
to come home late from a poker game
to a little wife that's goanna give you heck
she's sitting alone with a rolling pin
and will let you have it when you walk in
and when she gets through with you,
you'll be a wreck
if you had a little nip
and she smelled your breath
she'll start in nagging you half to death
and bud you'll have to put up
with that for life
cause the preacher said for better or worse
and until you ride that big black hoarse
you just naturally got yourself a wife
never, never trust a woman
you'll be sorry if you do
never, never trust a woman
she'll just make a monkey out of you

What kind of fool am I
Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one
That I have been thinking of

What kind of man is this?
An empty shell
A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell

What kind of lips are these
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am.

What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away the mask of play
And live my life?

Why can't I fall in love
Till I don't give a damn
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am

We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile 我们将怀念你的明眸和甜蜜微笑
For you take with you all of the sunshine 因为你带走所有的阳光
That has brightened our pathway a while 它曾照亮我们的路
Then come sit by my side if you love me 来坐在我身旁如果你爱我
Do not hasten to bid me adieu 不要离开得这样匆忙
Just remember the Red River Valley 你可要记住这红河谷
And the cowboy that loved you so true 还有那真爱你的牛仔
For a long time,my darling,I've waited 亲爱的，我已经等待了很久
For the sweet words you never would say. 等待你不愿说的蜜语
Now alas,all my fond hopes have vanished, 可现在我一切希望均成泡影
For they say that you are going away. 因为人们说你要离开

Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice
Più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva, lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscono perché
Quando tramonta, la luna li porta con sé
Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli
Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle
Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
E continuo a volare felice
Più in alto del sole ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare negli occhi tuoi blu
La tua voce è una musica dolce che suona per me
Volare, oh oh...
Cantare, ohohoho...
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù con te

When i find myself in times of trouble
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
When i wake up to the sound of music
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, oh let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
When i find myself in times of trouble
Mother mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

,Это так просто - рассказать тебе,
,Зачем просыпаюсь утром. На тостах сладкий джем.
,Одеваю свитер и волосы в хвосте. Я пою во сне...
,Потому, что просто - это лёгкие слова,
,Как на небе россыпь, замерла вода.
,И дождь обрушился, пока ты спал.
,За окнами ласковый май;
,А ты, мечтай, девочка, а ты влюбляй меня.
,Не думай - правильно или нет; -
,Целуй и оставляй помаду на щеках мне.
,Флора в город принесла дожди.
,Но мы не должны грустить и глотать никотин.
,Ты просто отпусти эти мысли по ветру с дымом.
,Девочка моя, наивная - необходимое лекарство
,От депрессии, как спрей от ангины.
,Мы выбросим её, как мелкий камушек в ботинке.
,Мы любим засыпать под фильмы;
,И нас с утра разбуит кот наш пушистый-будильный.
,Лёгкий омлет и молочный улун -
,Готовишь то, что я очень люблю.
,Я очень люблю с утра твой поцелуй.
,Просто поцелуй - простому пацану!
,Это так просто - рассказать тебе,
,Зачем просыпаюсь утром. На тостах сладкий джем.
,Одеваю свитер и волосы в хвосте. Я пою во сне...
,Потому, что просто - это лёгкие слова,
,Как на небе россыпь, замерла вода.
,И дождь обрушился, пока ты спал.
,Мы не выпрашивали любовь.
,Верили и ценили, не оправдывая прошлых ошибок.
,Необорачиваясь в бывшее ни на минуту.
,Кто бы не был у нас до этого друг у друга.
,Теперь, мы счастливы без них; И нам не нужно
,Больше их фальшивое, заветренное "Извини..."
,И если всё будет покончено - скажи мне это.
,Но главное - честно, чтобы без рикошета.
,Ты можешь просто говорить, читать, смеяться,
,Молчать - не важно, что; и я буду счастлив.
,Знаешь, мы получаем в жизни то, во что мы верим!
,И я - верю в нас! Верю - 7 дней в неделю.
,Верю 24/7!
,Я верю, - и ты тоже верь!
,И какая разница, что скажет о погоде МЕТЕО?
,Ведь миллион дорог сошлись, чтобы мы встретились...
,Это так просто - рассказать тебе,
,Зачем просыпаюсь утром. На тостах сладкий джем.
,Одеваю свитер и волосы в хвосте. Я пою во сне...

,Курительные смеси, не путай приход с реальностью
,Действовать, а не просто коцать пастью

,Оглянись вокруг, чему здесь праздновать?
,Зимой вместо снега насвай летит под губу,
,Я за расчеты не ебу, но тут лучше подумать
,Угрютый мусор худе телки с пмс
,Медленно посались песни, скучал маэстро
,В этих окрестностях есть вход, но нет выхода
,В любой непонятной ситуации пыхай
,Тихо так, ты прыгнула на хуй другому
,Бегать нанюханным, поступать как подонок
,Клинское давало в голову, купались голыми
,Передавай эболу по кругу петух на поло
,Полоумный полупидор полукозел
,Спросят за шмот, прикинься Васьком
,Коньком по горлу, давлениев норме

,потом ведь все намного может быть хуже ...
,ты выдыхаешь : у нас есть час
,час
,всего час
,и мы кладем на ковер оружие
,
,Design In Malice
,If I don't have the mag I get a bastard stabbed
,With a knife big as a claw for an Alaskan crab
,Young, I'm down with Vinnie give me six weeks
,All y'all little pipsqueaks is up shit's creek
,Think we a joke? I'll put three in your throat
,Drunk off gin and C&C coke then we flee in a boat
,Then I come open up the spot with coconut Ciroc so the hoes'll suck some cock
,Then I'll forget the call, after the nut I get attention deficit disorder
,1-5 catch us off Xes and dust
,Whole clique of registered sex offenders
,Pop shit, we'll hold your funeral XVs
,Niggas money come in roman numerals
,Cause y'all niggasmoney took a muscle-relaxer
,
,Chorus:
,I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
,It's work, not how I pass the time
,I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
,It's work, not how I pass the time
,
,I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
,It's work, not how I pass the time
,I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
,It's work, not how I pass the time
,
,My music's strong enough to stop a bomb
,I'm putting pressure on you kids like I'm a soccer mom
,Who you think idea that it was to stop Saddam?
,Who you think idea that was to drop the bomb?
,You get your shit rocked ma like Mustafa song
,You blowing smoke you motherfucker, you should cop a bong
,The nine Taurus jam a little bit, Glock is strong
,I move brutal and use voodoo like Papa Shango
,Over a billion Muslims, you could never stop Islam
,Over a billion bullets you confront the chopper's arm
,The backstage filled with liquor and a lot of traum
,Cause it's been hard on Vinnie since my father's gone
,I'm about to blow the fucking horns like it was Rosh Hashanah
,This is the calm before the storm, Armageddon dawn
,Carry a motherfucker head that I shred in Nam
,I speak literally, figuratively, the prophet gone
,
,Chorus:
,I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
,It's work, not how I pass the time

,
,You don't have to search and question
,I have the purse and the murder weapon
,Never get a second chance to make a first impression
,I'm no virgin, a murderer, and I'm an urban legend
,Rather be of real service than to serve in Heaven
,I don't like cops, I don't like co-operators
,I don't like traitors or story corroborators
,In any problem I'm the common denominator
,My behaviour is the product of intoxicators
,I'm just blood addicted, it's the other liquid
,I'm above the limit off of the blood of the wicked
,Don't even ask, there's somebody in the bodybags
,The blood matches that's on the hatchets and hockey mask
,I'm never traumatized, I don't have to compromise
,I don't have economize the homicides
,You tell Jesus to take the wheel my faith is nil
,I believe that even Jesus has a way to kill

,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Не надо,забудем,давай уже не будем,эти ссоры,разговоры.
,A что по сути слова,коротать да твои,одиноко молчим,но по сердцу стучит словно адреналин.
,Не буду,но знаю,что где-то я скучаю.
,Но в мыслях понимаю,все слова твои пустые.
,Но просто отпусти,пойми что больше нет.
,Тусим,я давно тебя просил.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Накидка на плече и мы с тобой в этот вечер,но я не понимаю,зачем нам эти встречи.
,Ведь мы разные,знаешь,я не люблю,ты скучаешь,раздели мы мечты,и ты об этом знаешь.
,Не буду,не надо встречаться даже взглядом.
,Отправил слова вулисон,забудем,что были рядом.
,Пусть уносят ветра о любви все слова твои,забудь и меня прости.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.

,There will always be
,The deeper level when you think you've reached
,You think you've reached it all and then there is
,Always more
,Oh let it go
,Sometimes I really feel
,The conflict that is there and it is for real
,Between my body and in my mind I know
,Then and there is always more
,The let-go
,So I go and move my way
,Whole like every day
,Sometimes I really hear
,These voices that keep telling me to reach
,For then at least I understand that why it is
,Could be that I cannot see
,Its glory
,So I go and move my way
,Whole like every day
,But I wear this head
,For the very first time
,And I've carried my skin since I learn how to climb
,It's not the very first time my singing
,Beyond known
,So I go and move my way
,Whole just like today
,
,Go ...
,
,Go to the mountain if you must
,Go to the burning bush
,Happy would ease your troubled mind
,How do the fade just stay behind?
,I know you better than you think I do
,Don't worry babe.. this is why i fell in love with you
,The man in the looking glass
,Is looking back at you at last
,You can't hide from the truth
,Because the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth
,Because the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth
,Because the truth is all there is
,You can't hide
,If happy times are too few and far between
,It's a pity dear, we can't erase the things we've seen
,So disappear, vanish if you wish
,Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness
,And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
,And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
,I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go
,May not be true to see that you would return one day
,But in your present state you may as well not be here at all
,You wear a thin disguise, it's from yourself you hide
,Just take a look at us, we are heading for a fall
,Now presiding in this quarter: hip-hop
,Justice, my rap forté
,Judge, jury, bailing for prosecuting D.A.
,Et ceteras, paraphas
,My modus operende
,It's carpe diem whether the fact or word is your way
,Comprende?
,The people versus, you ain't no Sensi
,Teaching that style of word-play
,We got the words they
,Regardless of what your friends say
,They're all disable
,Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
,And this long arm of the law grabs a mighter
,Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
,The death sentence of this live litagator
,Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
,Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
,Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
,But when you read back verbatim
,What they're saying to pursuade them
,They realize exactly how i've played them
,I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
,'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with lies will
,I brew skill with free fills from now until
,Plagerizing MC's get their flows distilled
,Baby I don't die without you by my side
,As long as you return into these arms that burn
,Baby I won't die just take a look inside
,Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn
,I won't die, if you leave me high
,I won't die if you're not by my side
,And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
,And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth, cause the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth
,Because the truth is all there is
,You can't hide from the truth..

,Асып барам амалым жоқ қапы белестен.

,Неге сонша қатал болды алғашқы кездесу.
,Қолынан ұстап оның кете бердің сүйісе,
,Өзгенің құшағына мен бәлкім бермес ем.

,Когда я впервые увидел тебя, этот смех,
,Ты мне напомнила по-моему сразу всех.
,Кого я люблю, с кем хотел быть вместе,
,Я стоял как вкопанный, у меня не было слов.
,Еле выговорил, не подумай ничего плохого,
,Но мы ещё не расстались, а я уже хочу увидеть тебя снова.
,Я не могу надышаться запахом твоих волос,
,Ты можешь остаться? Честный вопрос.
,Первые поцелуи, на губах твоё имя,
,Простые слова, но я гордился ими.
,Так много всего вокруг, но с тобою иначе.
,Мне не кажется, я чувствую, что ты для меня значишь,
,Засыпая, держались за руки сильно-сильно,
,Я боялся потерять тебя, ты такая красивая.
,Я не мог наслушаться, как ты дышишь,
,Мне ничего не нужно без тебя, слышишь!
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.
,Мы начинали, мечтая, наш путь к успеху,
,Наш день был долгим и наполнен смехом.
,Жили без времени, не думая о годах, минутах.
,Радовались, как дети, когда находили деньги в зимних куртках.
,Нам не нужна была слава и золотые карточки,
,Мы просто любили и светились, как лампочки.
,Ты как с другой планеты, ни на кого не похожа,
,Я говорю о тебе, и у меня мурашки по коже.
,Мы всегда оставались собою, чему я так рад,
,Мы простые ребята, а не Бони и Клайд.
,Думаем друг о друге, радуемся, что живём,
,Как невидимки, трещинки на лобовом.
,И если ты меня спросишь, есть ли у меня секрет,
,Я скажу, что счастлив, потому что у меня есть ты.
,Мы всегда были вместе, послушай,
,Мне ничего в этом мире без тебя не нужно.
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.
,Я благодарен небу, я благодарен судьбе,
,Что эту песню я посвящаю тебе.
,С тобою я понял, кто я такой,
,Все мои страхи далеко-далеко.
,В этом городе, в этой квартире,
,В этой жизни, в этом странном мире
,Я прошу тебя, будь со мной рядом,
,Ты - моя любовь, ты - всё, что мне надо.
,
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.
,Ай, больно, ай, больно, ай,
,Дай мне нежность.

,Songs Title：i get a kick out of you
,My story is much to sad to be told
,But practically everything leaves me totally cold
,The only exception I know is the case
,When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
,Then I suddenly turn and see
,Your fabulous face
,I get no kick from champagne
,Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
,So tell me why should it be true
,That I get a kick out of you
,Some like the perfume from spain
,Im sure that if I took even one sniff
,It would bore me terrifically too
,But I get a kick out of you
,I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
,I get a kick though its clear to see, you obviously do not adore me
,
,I get no kick in a plane
,Flying too high with some gal in the sky
,Is my idea of nothing to do
,But I get a kick out of you
,
,
,
,Welcome to my world,
,Won't you come on in
,Miracles, I guess
,Still happen now and then
,Step into my heart
,Leave your cares behind
,Welcome to my world
,Built with you in mind
,Knock and the door will be open
,Seek and you will find
,Ask and you'll be given
,The key to this world of mine
,I'll be waiting there
,With my arms unfurled
,Waiting just for you
,Welcome to my world
,Waiting just for you
,Welcome to my world

,We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
,We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here

,To brighten up the night, i have you love
,And we can face the music together

Dont know why theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
Keeps rainin all the time
Life is bare, gloom and misry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just cant get my poorself together,
Im weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin chair will get me.
All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Cant go on, evry thing I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I aint together,
Keeps rainin all the time

,February 5th, Friday morning, purple dawn
,Broke a yawn, as a I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
,A moment like a poem, you wish you could hold it
,I shut my eyes like it's frozen, it's gone when I open
,It slipped passed the clouds right there where it lingered
,Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
,My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
,ON a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning
,If only I could touch past the phony
,If only they were there now to hold me
,As the questions keep droning
,
,You're the only one who stuck it out last night
,The only other one who caught the other line
,You're the only one when this world collides
,The one that I can't deny

,
,It's my last year here
,My first class moved to portable 'a'
,Under construction since summer
,And it's cold today
,I can see my breath, and what's left of the west parking lot
,And all the spaces that we fought
,And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
,In past piles of rubble, in puddles of rain water
,That hurt last night when I left like that
,When I won't come back
,Speaking my peace to the past
,I can't help but wonder, who is this wind at my back
,A whisper to walk on, come on from all that
,You're the only one who stuck it out last night
,The only other one who caught the other line
,You're the only one when this world collides
,The one that I can't deny
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are
,In an unreliable world you shine like a star
,It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
,It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
,
,How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind
,You found me on a summer breeze
,How am I gonna run away when the autom breaks
,Now that you found me in the spring
,Come on and sing it out
,It's undeniable how brilliant you are

There are roads
That can take you to places
That you've never been
There are people
When you meet them
It's like they have lived
Inside your skin
There are souls
You connect with so strong
A bond that is so deep
And so true
That's the way
I feel about you
There are times
Like a magnet
You are drawn
Into somebody's life
You don't know
What you're doing
Are why you are there
But, you know it's right
There's a sense
That the piece that was missing
Has suddenly come into view
That's the way
I feel about you
I believe in this world
There is nothing
That happens by chance
There's a reason
That I just as would take you
The moment you came
Into my hands like a gift
That you're never expecting
But you treasure
Your whole life through
That's the way
I feel about you
There's a sense
That the piece that was missing
Has suddenly come into view
That's the way
That's the way
That's the way
I feel about you

Besame besame mucho
Cette chanson d'autrefois je la chante pour toi
Besame besame mucho
Comme une histoire d'amour qui ne finirait pas
On la chantée dans les rues
sur des ciels inconnus et dans toute la France
On la croyait oubliée
et pour mieux nous aimer voilà qu'elle recommence
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi.
On ne demande à l'amour
ni serment de toujours ni décor fantastique
Pour nous aimer il nous
simplement quelque mots qui vont sur la musique
Besame besame mucho
Si dans un autre pays ça veut dire embrasse-moi
Besame besame mucho
Toute ma vie, je voudrais la chanter avec toi

I want you the right way 
I want you, but I want you to want me too 
Want you to want me baby 
Just like I want you 
Da da, da da, da da da 
I'll give you all the love I want in return 
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling 
It's too bad, it's just too sad 
You don't want me no more 
But I'm gonna change your mind 
Some way, somehow 
, 
Da da, da da, da da da 
One way love is just a fantasy 
To share is precious, pure and fair 
Don't play with something you should cherish for life 
Oh baby, don't you wanna care? 
Ain't it lonely out there? 
, 
I want you the right way 
I want you, but I want you to want me too 
Want me baby, just like I want you 
Da da, da da, da da da

,I think about that day
,I left him at a Greyhound station
,West of Santa Fé
,
,We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
,Still I did what I had to do
,'Cause I just knew
,
,Summer: Sunday nights
,We'd sink into our seats
,Right as they dimmed out all the lights
,A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
,It called me to be on that screen
,And live inside each scene
,
,Without a nickel to my name
,Hopped a bus, here I came
,Could be brave or just insane
,
,We'll have to see
,
,'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
,He'll sit one day, the lights are down
,He'll see my face and think of how he...
,...used to know me
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,I hear 'em ev'ry day
,The rhythms in the canyons
,That'll never fade away
,The ballads in the barrooms
,Left by those who came before
,They say "you gotta want it more"
,So I bang on ev'ry door
,
,And even when the answer's "no"
,Or when my money's running low
,The dusty mic and neon glow
,Are all I need
,
,And someday as I sing my song
,A small-town kid'll come along
,
,That'll be the thing to push him on and go go
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,And when they let you down
,The morning rolls around
,
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Just another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Another day has just begun
,It's another day of sun
,
,It's another day of sun

,River of love,behold
,Where the palms are swaying low
,And lovers get so enthralled
,Bengawan Solo
,River of love we know
,Where my heart was set aglow
,When we loved not long ago
,Chorus:
,Nightingales softly singing
,The guitar is gently playing
,Moon and stars brightly shining
,Shining for you and I
,In that moment divine
,You whispered you were mine
,And you vowed we ’d never part
,Down by the river of love
,Chorus:
,Nightingales softly singing
,The guitar is gently playing
,Moon and stars brightly shining
,Shining for you and I
,In that moment divine
,You whispered you were mine
,And you vowed we ’d never part
,Down by the river of love
,And then there was you
,And then there was you my dear
,I thought love was a game one would win or would lose
,Until I found you
,Until I found you my dear
,I thought love was a shame so I threw it away
,And then there was you
,I thought I was right
,But now it seems I was wrong
,I just waited so long and I feared love had gone
,And then there was you

,Oh baby I can move on
,I can fight it
, 作曲 : Hayes, Nowels
,Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
,I found your address and got your phone number too
,Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
,Been to secret places you think nobody knows
,If I had to live without you
,Nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I've been hanging 'round all the places you haunt
,Spying on your friends to find out what you want
,Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
,Follow you around driving home in your car
,Do I have to breathe without you?
,'Cause nobody could
,I need to be around you
,Watching you
,No one else can love you like I do
,Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,I know this must be wrong
,It can't go on
,This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
,And making me a mockery
,This must be wrong
,It can't go on
,So won't somebody free me from this misery?
,Bring my baby closer to me
,'Cause no one else can love you like I do
,You feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin'
,No one else can love you like I do
,I know you feel it when I'm creepin up on you
,I know that it wouldn't be right
,If I stayed all night
,Just to peep in on you
,Creepin' up on you
,'Cause no one else can love you, no no
,Like I do
,I know you feel me peeping in on you
,Watching everything you do
,'Cause no one else can love you, no
,Like I do
,No one else should love you, no
,Like I do
,Baby creepin' up on you
,Watching everything you do
,Yeah 'cause no one else can love you
,No no one else should touch you
,No one else can love you
,Touch you
,Love you
,Be with you
,No
,I feel like I've been locked up tight
,For a century of lonely nights
,Waiting for someone to release me
,You're licking your lips
,And blowing kisses my way
,But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
,Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)
,Ooooh
,My body's saying lets go
,Ooooh
,But my heart is saying no
,If you wanna be with me
,Baby there's a price to pay
,I'm a genie in a bottle
,You gotta rub me the right way
,If you wanna be with me
,I can make your wish come true
,You gotta make a big impression
,I gotta like what you do
,I'm a genie in a bottle baby
,Gotta rub me the right way honey
,I'm a genie in a bottle baby
,Come, come, come on and let me out
,The music's playing
,The light's down low
,Just one more dance
,And then we're good to go
,Waiting for someone
,Who needs me
,Hormones racing at the speed of light
,But that don't mean its gotta be tonight
,Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)
,Ooooh
,My body's saying lets go
,Ooooh
,But my heart is saying no
,If you wanna be with me

,And I'll be with you

,I had a way then
,Losing it all on my own
,I had a heart then
,But the queen has been overthrown
,And I'm not sleeping now
,The dark is too hard to beat
,And I'm not keeping up
,The strength I need to push me
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
,Calling, calling, calling home
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Noises, I play within my head
,Touch my own skin
,And hope they'll still be there
,And I think back to when
,My brother and my sister slept
,In another place
,The only time I feel safe
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
,And dreaming when they're gone
,Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home
,Calling, calling, calling home
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
,You shine them when I'm alone
,Lights, lights...
,You show the lights that stop me turn to stone

,Home, home
,Lights, lights, lights...

,through my mind like a symphony
,There's no way to describe what you do to me
,You just do to me  what you do
,And it feels like I've been rescued
,I've been set free

,Maybe it'll never come around*
,Maybe let you push me to the ground
,I'll go 'cause if I don't it's taking me down

Bernadette people are searchin' for
the kind of love that we possess.
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
and never find the love I've found in you.
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
and I'm well aware of what's on their minds.
They pretend to be my friend when all the time
they long to persuade you from my side.
They'd give the world and all they own
for just one moment we have known.
Bernadette they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette I want you because I need you to live.
But while I live only to hold you
Some other men they long to control you.
But how can they control you Bernadette
when they can not control themselves Bernadette
from needing you wanting you
But darling you belong to me.
I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world you're the soul of me
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
the world is searching for
But you you give me the joy this heart of mine
has always been longing for.
In you I have what other men long for.
All men need someone to worship and adore
that's why I treasure you and place you high above
for the only joy in life is to be loved.
So whatever you do Bernadette keep on loving me
Bernadette keep on needing me
Bernadette.
Bernadette.
Your the soul of me
more than a dream your a plan to me.
you mean more to me
than a woman was ever meant to be.

,I was lost
,I was thinking
,Since you were gone
,Lose my mind
,and I'm out of mind
,I'm giving in
,always all you love
,I wasn't strong
,I can see you clearly in my mind
,I know that all what you mean
,from my past path
,Wishing you were near me as we were
,so you can go back in time
,oh~ho~
,Since you've been gone
,my heart is aching
,I've been lost with the air you love
,It's been so long
,My world is shaking
,but you know I can wait on
,Since you've been gone
,oh~
,Since you've been gone
,oh~
,Since you've been gone

,What is life?
,Life is like a big obstacle
,put in front of your optical to slow you down
,And everytime you think you gotten past it
,it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
,What are friends?
,Friends are people that you think are your friends
,But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
,and disguises, to hide they true colors
,So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
,they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
,What is money?
,Money is what makes a man act funny
,Money is the root of all evil
,Money'll make them same friends come back around
,swearing that they was always down
,What is life?
,I'm tired of life
,I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
,I'm tired of committing so many sins
,Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
,Tired of never having any ends
,Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
,I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
,Tired of not having a deal
,Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
,Tired of drowning in my sorrow
,Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
,I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
,I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
,then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
,I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
,Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
,for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
,I'm tired of using plastic silverware
,Tired of working in Building Square
,Tired of not being a millionaire
,But if I had a million dollars
,I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
,If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
,without a condom on, while I'm on the john
,If I had a million bucks
,it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
,robbing armored trucks
,If I had one wish
,I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
,I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
,Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
,I'm tired of not having a phone
,Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
,Tired of not driving a BM
,Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
,Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
,Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
,Tired of not being on tour
,Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
,in the back of a Contour
,I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
,Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
,Tired of being stared at
,I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
,Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
,Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
,Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
,saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
,I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
,Tired of J-L-B saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"
,But if I had a million dollars
,I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
,If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
,without a condom on, while I'm on the john
,If I had a million bucks
,it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
,robbing armored trucks
,If I had one wish
,I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
,You know what I'm saying?
,I'm tired of all of this bullshit
,Telling me to be positive
,How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
,Know what I'm sayin?
,I rap about shit around me, shit I see
,Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything
,Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
,Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
,But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
,Just fed up
,That's my word
,
,Tuyo es mi corazn oh sol de mi querer
,Mujer de mi ilusin mi amor te consagr
,Mi vida la embelleces una esperanza azul
,Mi vida tiene un cielo que le diste t
,Tuyo es mi corazn oh sol de me querer
,Tuyo es todo mi ser t eres mi mujer

,Tuyo es mi corazn oh sol de me querer
,Tuyo es todo mi ser t eres mi mujer
,Ya todo el corazn te lo entregu
,Eres mi fe eres mi dios eres mi amor
,I see trees of green, red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
,They're really saying I love you.
,I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more than I'll never know
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
Lyrics：Rogers/Hart Music：Rogers/Hart
My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

,Back at the start
,It was all hearts and flowers
,Candlelight rendezvous
,That lasted for hours
,But since he's gone
,You toss and turn until dawn
,Nobody ever told you
,It would feel like this when
,Each tender dream
,Just seems to fade like dew does
,Your arms keep reaching
,For the lover man who was
,Faithless and mean
,But now he's gone from the scene
,They oughta write a song about that
,About the way it hurts when you realize
,All those promises were false
,About the lonely sound when the music dies
,Like a broken waltz
,If there were prizes
,For those sighs of regret
,You'd be the envy
,Of the "oh, woe is me" set
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,They oughta write a song about that
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,Oh, they ought to write a song about that
,Somebody somewhere
,Oughta write a song about that
,I see trees of green... red roses too
,I see 'em bloom... for me and you
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
,
,I see skies of blue... clouds of white
,Bright blessed days...dark sacred nights
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
,
,The colors of a rainbow...so pretty ..in the sky
,Are also on the faces...of people ..going by
,I see friends shaking hands...sayin'.. how do you do
,They're really sayin'...i love you.
,
,I hear babies cry... I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more...than I'll never know
,And I think to myself... what a wonderful world
,... what a wonderful world
中島美嘉 - YOU'D BE SO NICE TO COME HOME TO
feat.勝手にしやがれ

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love

You'd be so nice to come home to.
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high
Sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice
You'd be paradise
To come home to and love

,
, How much do I love you?
, I'll tell you no lie
, How deep is the ocean?
, How high is the sky?
, How many times a day do I think of you?
, How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
, How far would I travel
, To be where you are?
, How far is the journey
, From here to a star?
, And if I ever lost you,
, How much would I cry?
, How deep is the ocean?
, How high is the sky?

,Some of them got closer than others
,Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
,I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
,But I was happy to explain
,I never really knew how to move you
,So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins and I saw you
,But that's not an invitation, that's all I get
,If this is communication I disconnect
,I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
,You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
,In the corner of your eye
,I'll never really learn how to love you
,But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky where I see you
,And that's not an invitation, that's all I get
,If this is communication I disconnect
,I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect, so I disconnect
,Well this is an invitation, it's not a threat
,If you want communication that's what you get
,I'm talking and talking but I don't know how to connect
,And I hold a record for being patient with your kind of hesitation
,I need you, you want me but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
,I disconnect

,(Oh girl!)
,I take all the blame
,(C'mon girl)

,Though old so new
,To fill your heart like no three words Could ever do.

,and you sure look like a star to me
,There is nothing special about me

,I've been running and jumping, but barely
,Getting, getting over the bar
,I plan on being much more than
,I am but that's in do time
,But until then I'm guilty
,and being humans my crime
,Being human that is my crime
,Being human that is my crime
,Just keep trying and trying

,And gave me a brand new start
,Now I'm walking, breathing living proof
,And dear John, He can do this for you
,There's freedom on the other side of
,Things that keep us tied up and afraid
,There's hope in every situation

,Dear John, He loves you just the way you are
,You are forgiven by His scars
,Just open up your heart (your heart)

,Saying I love you
,Is not the words I want to hear from you
,It's not that I want you
,Not to say, but if you only knew
,How easy it would be to show me how you feel
,More than words is all you have to do to make it real
,Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
,Cos I'd already know
,What would you do if my heart was torn in two
,More than words to show you feel
,That your love for me is real
,What would you say if I took those words away
,Then you couldn't make things new
,Just by saying I love you
,More than words
,Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
,All you have to do is close your eyes
,And just reach out your hands and touch me
,Hold me close don't ever let me go
,More than words is all I ever needed you to show
,Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

,Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
,The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
,And all the tears you cried, that called my name
,And when you needed me I came through
,I paint a picture of the days gone by
,When love went blind and you would make me see
,I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
,So that I knew you were there for me
,Time after time you were there for me
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,We spend the summer with the top rolled down
,Wished ever after would be like this
,You said I love you babe, without a sound
,I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
,I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,We've had our share of hard times
,But that's the price we paid
,And through it all we kept the promise that we made
,I swear you'll never be lonely
,Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
,Washed away a dream of you
,But nothing else could ever take you away
,'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
,Oh my darling, I love you
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
,Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
,Love letters in the sand - I remember you
,Through the sleepless nights and every endless day
,I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you"I Remember You"
,She's got a smile that it seems to me
,Reminds me of childhood memories
,Where everything
,Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
,Now and then when I see her face
,She takes me away to that special place
,And if I stared too long
,I'd probably break down and cry
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,She's got eyes of the bluest skies
,As if they thought of rain
,I hate to look into those eyes
,And see an ounce of pain
,Her hair reminds me
,Of a warm safe place
,Where as a child I'd hide
,And pray for the thunder
,And the rain
,To quietly pass me by
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now
,Where do we go
,Ow Where do we go now
,Where do we go now
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now

,Sometimes I wonder
,How I'd ever make it through'
,Through this world without having you
,I just wouldn't have a clue
,'Cause sometimes it seems
,Like this world's closing in on me'
,And there's no way of breaking free
,And then I see you reach for me
,Sometimes I wanna give up
,I wanna give in' I wanna quit the fight
,And then I see you' baby
,And everythin~s airight' everything's airight
,When I see you smile

,Oh yeah' baby when I see you smile at me
,Baby there's nothing
,in this world that could ever do
,What a touch of your hand can do
,It's like nothing that I ever knew
,And when the rain is falling
,I don't feel it' 'cause you're here with me now
,And one look at you baby
,Is ali I'll ever need' you're all rll ever need

,I guess this time you＇re really leaving
,I heard your suitcase say goodbye
,And as my broken heart lies bleeding
,You say true love in suicide
,You say you＇re cried a thousand rivers
,And now you＇re swimming for the shore
,You left me drowning in my tears
,And you won＇t save me anymore
,Now I＇m praying to God you＇ll give me one more chance, girl

,Words can＇t say what a love can do
,I＇ll be there for you
,I know you know we＇re had some good times
,How they have their own hiding place
,I can promise you tomorrow
,But I can＇t buy back yesterday
,And Baby you know my hands are dirty
,But I wanted to be your valentine
,I＇ll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
,When you get drink, I＇ll be the wine
,I＇ll be there for you

,I wish I＇d seen you blow those candles out
,I＇ll be there for you

, When you make love,
, do you look in the mirror?
, Who do you think of?
, Does he look like me?
, Do you tell lies?
, And say that it's forever?
, Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?
, Ooh babe
, When you're alone, do you let go?
, Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show?
, Ooh c'mon
, I don't wanna touch you too much baby
, 'cos making love to you might drive me crazy

,Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
,But the scar, that scar remains
,
,I know i could have saved a love that night
,If i'd known what to say
,Instead of makin' love
,We both made our separate ways
,
,But now i hear you found somebody new
,And that i never meant that much to you
,To hear that tears me up inside
,And to see you cuts me like a knife

,When I look into your eyes
,I can see a love restrained
,But darlin' when I hold you
,Don't you know I feel the same
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever
,And we both know hearts can change
,And it's hard to hold a candle
,In the cold November rain
,We've been through this such a long long time
,Just tryin' to kill the pain
,But lovers always come and lovers always go
,An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
,Walking away
,If we could take the time to lay it on the line
,I could rest my head
,Just knowin' that you were mine
,All mine
,So if you want to love me
,then darlin' don't refrain
,Or I'll just end up walkin'
,In the cold November rain
,Do you need some time...on your own
,Do you need some time...all alone
,Everybody needs some time...on their own
,Don't you know you need some time...all alone
,I know it's hard to keep an open heart
,When even friends seem out to harm you
,But if you could heal a broken heart
,Wouldn't time be out to charm you
,Sometimes I need some time...on my own
,Sometimes I need some time...all alone
,Everybody needs some time...on their own
,Don't you know you need some time...all alone
,And when your fears subside
,And shadows still remain
,I know that you can love me
,When there's no one left to blame
,So never mind the darkness
,We still can find a way
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever
,Even cold November rain

,I guess the time was right for us to say
,We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day
,We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer

,With you I never wonder
,Will you be there for me
,With you I never wonder
,You're the right one for me
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,A love to last my whole life through
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,Forever in my heart
,I finally found the love of a lifetime
,With every kiss our love is like brand-new
,And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
,Still we both know that the road is long
,(But) we know that we will be together
,Because our love is strong
,I finally found the love of a lifetime

Blow a kiss from your hand,
I catch it 'fore it hits the ground.
Cry a little for our fears Baby Baby,
I'm so scared, there's something wrong,
I hid you in the corner of my empty room,
Never really cared til now,
Not standing in the corner from Me,
Anymore, you've done your time,
I sure sent 'em my best line,
When my time is thru, oh,
Can I still come home to you?
Anytime Anytime you want me,
Anytime Anytime you're lonely,
You just have to call,
'Cause you know I'll be there.

Anytime Anytime, you need me,
Anytime Anytime, maybe you're dreamin',
Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming...Oh...
I know I caused you so much pain,
I promise that I'll never hurt you again.
Even though the scars remain,
With a little time I know, We can win,
can't stop this ride,
Lost control of my desire,
Still it burns for you,
Like it always used to do.
Anytime Anytime you want me,
Anytime Anytime you're lonely,
You just have to call,
'Cause you know I'll be there.

Anytime Anytime, you need me,
Anytime Anytime, maybe you're dreamin',
Waking up all alone, your heart is screaming, Oh...
And after the war is over,
and all the fightings thru,
Can't I make my peace with you,
I wanna come home to you.
Anytime Anytime you want me,
Anytime Anytime you're lonely,
You just have to call,
'Cause I'm always there.

Verse 1 Time seemed to pass me by 
I found myself alone, wondering why 
Then you came into my life 
And gave your love to me 
You are the one 
That showed me the way 
In my heart you'll stay 
Chorus And 
I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever it will be 
You and me together 
Bridge I want your love forever 
I need your love 
You're the only one 
That fills my heart 
And I love you 
More and more everyday 
Chorus 2 And 
I believe in you 
Whoa-oh through and through 
Always and forever it will be you and me 
I will sing to you and all you do 
Always and forever it will be you and me together
,You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
,There was something missing
,You should've known by the tone a' my voice, maybe
,But you didn't listen
,You played dead, but you never bled,
,Instead you lay still in the grass, all coiled up and hissing
,And though I know all about those men
,Still I don't remember
,Cause it was us, baby, ready for them
,And we're still together
,And I meant, every word I said
,When I said that I love you, I meant that I'd love you forever
,And I'm gonna keep on loving you
,Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep
,I just wanna keep on loving you
,And I meant, every word I said
,When I said that I love you, I meant that I'd love you forever
,And I'm gonna keep on loving you
,Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep
,I just wanna keep on loving you
,Baby I'm gonna keep on loving you
,'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
,I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on loving you
Want to buy some illusions
Slightly used, second-hand ?
They were lovely illusions,
Reaching high, built on sand.
They had a touch of paradise,
A spell you can't explain,
For in this crazy paradise
You are in love with pain.
Want to buy some illusions
Slightly used, just like new ?
Such romantic illusions,
And they're all about you.
Too bad they all fell apart
Like dreams often do.
They were lovely illusions,
But they just wouldn't come true.
Slightly used, just like new,
Such romantic illusions
And they're all about you.
I'd sell them all for a penny,
They make pretty souvenirs.
Take my lovely illusions,
Some for laughs, some for tears.
On this next song, I'm using the translation, a new translation done by one of my best, best, best, best friends in Ireland, the playwriter and poet, Frank McGuinness, and he did a new translation of the Threepenny Opera about four or five years ago, and I played Pirate Jenny in that production at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. And I love this translation, I think it's so exceptional. In this song, Jenny who is a prostitute and a waitress in a, in a, in a shitty hotel, er, obviously on the docks, and, and Macheath is her pimp, is imagining, is having a fantasy of what she would do to those who oppress her if she could.

,Where do you start?
,How do you separate the present from the past?
,How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last?
,That didn't last
,With bits of memories scattered here and there
,I look around and don't know where to start
,Which books are yours?
,Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
,Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine
,That intertwine
,So many habits that we'll have to break
,And yesterday's we'll have to take apart
,One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
,To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
,A moment in what might have been
,Where do you start?
,Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
,Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye?
,I guess you try
,And though I don't know where and don't know when
,I'll find myself in love again
,I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
,A tiny part deep in my heart, that stays in love with you

I kissed you 'cause 
I've never been an angel
I learned to say hosannas on my knees
But they threw me out of 
Sunday school when 
I was nine
And the sisters said 
I did just as 
I pleasedNow even so 
I try to be a good girl
It's only what 
I want that makes me weak
I had no desire to be a child of sin
Then you went and pressed your whiskers to my cheek

Dancing with damnation is a ball
But of all the little ways

I go and live the 
Life of Riley?
Why can't 
I go back home to apple pie?'
Cause your affront to my virtue was a touch too much
But you left a little twinkle in my eye

,What am I to you
,Tell me darling true
,To me you are the sea
,Vast as you can be
,And deep the shade of blue
,When you’re feeling low
,To whom else do you go
,See I cry if you hurt
,I’d give you my last shirt
,Because I love you so
,Now if my sky should fall
,Would you even call
,I've Opened up my heart
,I never want to part
,I’m giving you the ball
,When I look in your eyes
,I can feel the butterflies
,I'll love you when you’re blue
,Tell me darlin true
,What am I to you
,Now  if my sky should fall
,Would you even call
,I'll Opened up my heart
,I never wanna part
,givin you the ball
,I look in your eyes
,I can feel the butterflies
,Could you find a love in me
,Could you carve me in a tree
,Don’t fill my heart with lies
,I will you love when you’re blue
,Tell me darlin true
,What am I to you
, 作曲 : Winehouse
,For you I was a flame
,Love is a losing game
,Five story fire as you came
,Love is a losing game
,Why do I wish I never played
,Oh what a mess we made
,And now the final frame
,Love is a losing game
,Played out by the band
,Love is a losing hand
,More than I could stand
,Love is a losing hand
,Self professed... profound
,Till the chips were down
,know you're a gambling man
,Love is a losing hand
,Though I'm rather blind
,Love is a fate resigned
,Memories mar my mind
,Love is a fate resigned
,Over futile odds
,And laughed at by the gods
,And now the final frame
,Love is a losing game
,
,For you there'll be no crying
,For you the sun will be shining
,'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
,It's alright I know it's right
,And the songbirds keep singing
,Like they know the score
,And I love you I love you I love you
,Like never before
,
,To you I would give the world
,To you I'd never be cold
,'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
,It's alright I know it's right
,And the songbirds keep singing
,Like they know the score
,And I love you I love you I love you
,Like never before
,Like never before
,like never before
Was there something more I could have done?
Or was I not meant to be the one?
Where's the life I thought we would share?
And should I care?
And will someone else get more of you?
Will she go to sleep more sure of you?
Will she wake up knowing you're still there?
And why should I care?
There's always one to turn and walk away,
And one who just wants to stay.
But who said that love is always fair?
And why should I care?
Should I leave you alone here in the dark,
Holding my broken heart?
While a promise still hangs in the air-
And why should I care? 

,I see trees of green
,

,It's in our hello
,In the way your smile glows
,And it's in our good bye
,In the tear in your eye
,And all in between
,When you're lookin at me
,I know, I know, I know
,What you don't say
,
,It shimmers through
,In the things you do
,When you write me a note
,And send it by the post
,What you might not sign
,On that bottom line
,I know, I know, I know
,What you don't say
,Words are not needed
,And though my ears
,Could be misled
,My heart can hear instead
,What goes unsaid
,
,You'll leave me with this
,A hug and a kiss
,
,And that little phrase
,Those three words
,You can't say
,But please don't feel blue
,Cause I always knew
,And I know, I know, I know
,And I love you too

,(Beautiful, please don't hurry)

,I wish I knew how
,(Your eyes are like starlight)

,I really can't stay
,(Baby, don't hold out)
,Oh, baby it's cold outside
,
,I simply must go
,(But baby, it's cold outside)
,The answer is no
,(But baby, it's cold outside)
,
,This welcome has been
,(How lucky that you dropped in)
,So nice and warm
,(Look out the window at that storm)
,My sister will be suspicious
,(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
,My brother will be there at the door
,(Waves upon a tropical shore)
,My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
,(gosh, your lips are delicious)
,But maybe just have a drink more
,(Never such a blizzard before)
,I've got to get home
,(But baby, you'll freeze out there)
,Say, lend me your coat
,(It's up to your knees out there)
,You've really been grand
,(I thrill when you touch my hand)
,But don't you see
,(How can you do this thing to me?)
,There's bound to be talk tomorrow
,(Think of my life long sorrow)
,At least there will be plenty implied
,(If you caught pneumonia and died)
,I really can't stay
,(Get over that hold out)
,Oh, baby  it's cold outside
,
,it's cold outside
,
,it's cold outside

,暖かな雨に 打たれながら
,嘘も涙も罪も 洗い流して
,あなたに会いに行けたら
,
,蕾は咲くことを諦めて
,うつりゆく景色を眺めてた
,限りある時間とは知っても
,どこにも行けないと震えてた
,
,止むことを忘れた一粒は
,アスファルトを黒く染めたあと
,足早に過ぎ去る人々の影に
,悲しみを落とした
,
,私は愛も知らず 待ち続けている
,暖かな雨に 願いながら
,過去も迷いも捨てて
,あなたのためにもっと
,生きていけたのなら
,限りない地平線の向こう
,繋がってる空の下で
,あなたの腕に抱かれるように

,願いかける 恋音と雨空
,君と離れてから数日
,目の土砂降りの雨の中
,こんな日は必ず傘を届けにいった

,いるはずのない面影待つ
,傘もささず、ずぶ濡れな君はそこにいた

,信じた明日も
,君は過去と笑うの?
,流し去る力も無く
,あの日のままで時間が止まる
,雫が二つ
,君の頬を伝う
,絶えず止まぬ雨のせいと恋音は詠う
,町行く恋人が羨ましく思うことが増えた
,いつから一人が怖くなったんだろう
,でも今は束の間の幸せ
,できることならこのまま
,ありふれた恋人達になりたい
,君がここで望んでいること
,僕がここでいいたいこと
,今なら想いも重なるかな?
,「好きだよ」と伝えればいいのに
,願う先、怖くていえず

,それだけでも もういい!
,だけど一握りの幸せも
,君がくれたものだから
,本当はずっと抱きしめていたい
,「すれ違いも、二人もう一度
,やり直すための試練」だって
,すぐに言えるのなら どんなにいいだろうか
,好きという事実通りすぎて
,今ではもう愛している
,失った数日間でやっと知った
,本当はこのまま気持ち確かめたくて、、、
,「好きだよ」と伝えればいいのに

,何万回と触れた指先
,どうしてどうして離してしまったの
,ねぇその髪も ねぇその肩も
,なにげなく触れた君の全て
,繋いだ手と手 胸の鼓動も
,あぁ...今君に逢いたいよ

,Fairy tales can come true
,It can happen to you if you're young at heart
,For it's hard, you will find
,To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart
,You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
,You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
,And life gets more exciting with each passing day
,And love is either in your heart or on it's way
,Don't you know that it's worth
,Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
,For as rich as you are
,It's much better by far to be young at heart
,And if you should survive to a hundred and five

,A white suit from London and shoes from Paris

,Handsome as the heavens that a film would never cast
,But underneath the mask I see the skin of a man
,Smooth and seductive who's really got a plan
,It's drawing me in, magnetically to you
,You haven't got forever but I got that too

,And life will find a way
,I'll be your harvester of light
,And send it out tonight
,So we can start again

,I hope I'll see you later

,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
,Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
,You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
,Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
,Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
,If you want the things you love, you must have showers
,So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
,There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
,Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
,Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
,You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
,Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down
,Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
,If you want the things you love, you've got to have showers
,So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree

,Baby, it's cold outside
,This evening has been so very nice
,Been hoping that you'd drop in

,They're just like ice
,My mother will start to worry
,Beautiful, what's your hurry?
,My father will be pacing the floor
,Listen to the fireplace roar
,So really I'd better scurry
,Beautiful, please don't hurry
,But maybe just a half a drink more
,I'll put some records on while I pour
,The neighbors might think
,Baby, it's bad out there
,Say, what's in this drink?
,No cabs to be had out there
,I wish I knew how
,Your eyes are like starlight
,To break this spell
,I'll take your hat
,Your hair looks swell
,I ought to say no, no, no, sir
,Mind if I move in closer?
,At least I'm gonna say that I tried
,What's the sense in hurting my pride?
,I really can't stay
,Baby, don't hold out
,Baby, it's cold outside
,Uh, you're very pushy, you know?
,I like to think of it as optimistic
,I simply must go
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The answer is no
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The welcome has been so nice and warm
,How lucky that you dropped in
,Look out the window at that storm
,My sister will be suspicious
,Gosh, your lips look delicious
,My brother will be there at the door
,Waves upon a tropical shore
,My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
,Gosh, your lips are delicious
,But maybe just a cigarette more
,Never such a blizzard before
,And I don't even smoke
,I've got to get home
,Baby, you'll freeze out there
,Say, lend me your coat
,It's up to your knees out there
,You've really been grand
,I thrill when you touch my hand
,But don't you see
,How can you do this thing to me?
,There's bound to be talk tomorrow
,Think of my life long sorrow
,At least there will be plenty implied
,If you caught pneumonia and died
,I really can't stay
,Get over that hold out
,Baby, it's cold
,Baby it's cold outside
,Okay fine, just another drink then
,That took a lot of convincing
,in my solitude
,you haunt me
,With reveries
,of days gone by
,in my solitude
,you taunt me
,with memories
,that never die
,i sit in my chair
,and filled with despair
,theres no one could be so sad
,with gloom everywhere
,i sit and i stare
,i know that ill soon go mad
,in my solitude
,I'm praying
,dear lord above
,send back my love
,
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
,
,Let there be you
,Let there be me
,Let there be oysters
,Under the sea
,Let there be wind
,An occasional rain
,Chile con carne
,Sparkling champagne
,Let there be birds
,To sing in the trees
,Someone to bless me
,Whenever I sneeze
,Let there be cuckoos
,A lark and a dove
,But first of all, please
,Let there be love
,Let there be cuckoos
,A lark and a dove
,But first of all, please
,Let there be love
,Hmmm umm...love
,Hmmm umm...love
,Let there be love

,He's a demon, he's a devil
,And tell the biggest, sweetest lie
,And I forget that lipstick on his tie
,That I'll stop being so blind
,My momma must have dropped me on my head
,He's a demon, he's a devil
,Sometimes he thrills me through and through
,He's a darling, he's a dreamboat
,I had the measles at two
,My whooping cough was grim
,Everyone tells me he's no good
,He doesn't love me like he should
,I would forget him if I only could
,He's a doll
,That man can look me in the eye
,He's a demon, he's a devil
,A doll
,Sometimes I make up my mind
,And tell him off real bad
,But then he turns on those charms
,And there I am in his arms
,And I forget why I'm mad
,I ought to tell him "drop dead!"
,But I keep loving him instead
,A doll
,Sometimes he's sweet, sometimes he's true
,Sometimes I wish he were in Timbuktu
,He's a demon, he's a devil
,He's a doll
,He says he'll call for me late at night
,And take me out somewhere to dine
,Then staggers in and sings "Sweet Adeline"
,He's a dog!
,The chicken pocks and the flu
,I had the itch and the mumps
,The poison ivy and clumps
,To top it, now I've got him
,He's a palooka, he's a brute
,He drives me crazy but he's cute
,Why do I love a guy I ought to shoot
,He's a demon
,He's a devil
,He is a doll!

,Some things will never change
,I still hold your vision in my mind
,Say you still love me

,歌手：Celine  Dion
,The  first  time  ever  I  saw  your  face..
,I  thought  the  sun  rose  in  your  eyes..
,And  the  moon  and  the  stars  were  the  gifts  you  gave
,To  the  night  and  the  empty  skies  my  love
,The  first  time  ever  I  kissed  your  mouth
,I  felt  the  earth  move  in  my  hand
,Like  the  trembling  heart  of  a  captive  bird
,That  was  there  at  my  command  my  love
,The  first  time  ever  I  lay  with  you
,And  felt  your  heart  so  close  to  mine....
,The  first  time  ever  I  saw  your  face
,your  face  your  face
,your  face
,
,I wish you bluebirds in the spring
,To give your heart a song to sing
,And then a kiss
,Oh but more than this
,I wish you love
,And in July a lemonade
,To cool you in some leafy glade
,I wish you health
,And more than wealth
,I wish you love
,My breaking heart and I agree
,That you and I will never be
,So with my best, my very best
,I set you free
,I wish you shelter from the storm
,A cozy fire to keep you warm
,But most of all
,When snowflakes fall
,I wish you love
,My breaking heart and I agree
,That you and I will never be
,So with my best, my very best
,I set you free
,I wish you shelter from the storm
,A cozy fire to keep you warm
,But most of all
,When snowflakes fall
,I wish you love
,But most of all
,When snowflakes fall
,I wish you love

,The sun has left and forgotten me
,It's dark, I cannot see
,Why does this rain pour down?
,I'm gonna drown
,In a sea...of deep confusion
,Somebody told me - I don't know who
,Whenever you are sad and blue
,And you're feejin' all alone and left behind
,Just take a look inside and you will find
,You gotta hold on, hold on through the night
,Hang on, things will be all right
,Even when it's dark
,And not a bit of sparkling
,Sing-song sunshine from above
,Spreading rays of sunny love - just
,Hang on, hang on to the vine
,Stay on, soon you'll be divine

,More than the greatest love the world has known
,This is the love I give to you alone
,More than the simple words I try to say
,I only live to love you more each day
,More than you'll ever know my arms long to hold you so
,My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
,Longer than always is a long, long time
,But far beyond forever you'll be mine
,I know I never lived before
,And my heart is very sure
,No one else could love you more
,More than you'll ever know my arms long to hold you so
,My life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping
,Longer than always is a long, long time
,But far beyond forever you'll be mine
,I know I've never lived before
,But my heart is very sure
,No one else could love you more
,No one else could love you more
,Love you more.

,Lyrics to If You Know Love
,
,（S. MacKinnon/M. Johnson）
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love
,
,The sun don't rise the same
,
,When a heart sings,
,
,like a moonbeam
,
,It shines on everything
,
,If I told you,
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,
,I could not lie, if I tried
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love
,
,The birds don't sound the same
,
,With your sweet smile
,
,going on for miles
,
,It warms up everything
,
,If ya told me,
,
,you were so sure
,
,You found out that love
,
,had come to town
,
,you don't second guess it,
,
,if you know love
,
,Cotton candy and summer nights
,
,String of pearls and city lights
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,Lazy river and light
,
,pretty thoubo dark come my eye
,
,I would throw them all away for love
,
,oh yes i would
,
,If you know love,
,
,like I know love,
,
,the words won't sound the same
,
,I have stumbled
,
,I have wondered
,
,and found sweet happiness
,
,What if I told you
,
,I was so sure
,
,I woke up and Love
,
,whispered your name
,
,Baby believe it,
,If you know love
,
,well no way yes second guess it
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know love
,
,If you know like I know love
,
,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old Winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When Autumn leaves start to fall
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When Autumn leaves start to fall
,
,The very thought of you makes my heart sing
,Like an april breeze
,On the wings of spring
,And you appear in all your splendor
,My one and only love
,The shadow's fall and spread their
,Mystique charms in the hush of night
,While you're in my arms
,I feel your lips so warm and tender
,My one and only love
,The touch of your hand is like heaven
,A heaven that I've never known
,The blush on your cheek
,Whenever I speak
,Tells me that you are my own
,You fill my eager heart with
,Such desire every kiss you give
,Sets my soul on fire
,I give myself in sweet surrender
,My one and only love
,My one and only love
,
,
,You'll never find,as long as you live
,Someone who loves you tender like I do
,And you'll never find,no matter where you search
,Someone who cares about you the way I do
,No one,I'm not braggin'on myself,baby
,Cause I'm the one who loves you
,And there's no one else,no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-no one else
,And you'll never find,it'll take the end of all time
,Someone who understands you like I do
,No one,I'm not tryin'to make you stay,baby
,Cause I'm the one who loves you,and there is no one else
,No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-no one else no, one else

,
I'm home alone again and your out hangin' with your friends
So you say, somehow I know it's not quite that way
It's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feelin' like your ignorin' me
I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way
When you touch me my heart melts
Anything you did wrong I forgave, yeah
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drownin' in disappointment
And it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way
You said you cared 'bout me
But from what I see, I ain't feelin' that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
Yeah, and you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no no no more, no more
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

Yeah, what's up?
So, I know you know this dude,
So I need you to talk to me and just tell me
What's going on? You know what I'm saying?
Woman to woman, I think it's only fair
I already know, so just let me know (you know what I'm saying) what you know?

It's going around, y'all been doing your thing
And no matter what I say, it's not gonna just change things
See I wanna know, no one wants to be cheated on
Can you just keep it real with me, woman to woman?

You got me (got me like the feds), checking on the evidence
Checking out where you've been
What you've been doing with her
So can we keep it real?
I wanna know everything
So girl tell me everything
I ain't really tripping
But I gotta know what's going on?


Girl I've been in this here long enough
See I've been doing this here long enough
So I'mma tell you where I stand,
I gave my heart to this man, yeah
He never mentioned he was in a situation,
He told me I was his one and only, yeah, yeah
See, we gon' have to sit down,
And figure this thing out, yeah

Yeah you gon' have to tell me
I don't know why he wanna play me
And leave me in the blind,
I thought we knew
What we wanted to do

He got me (got me like the feds), checking on the evidence (got me yeah yeah)
Checking out where you've been
Come on
What you've been doing with her?
So can we keep it real?
I wanna know everything
So girl tell me everything
I ain't really tripping
But I gotta know what's going on?

We had a home together
He said it would last forever
And no matter what, no one would ever break us up
No-oh


And he got his clothes over here (oh really)
We've been building this life for years (say word)
Been through ups and downs,
He even stayed at his mamma's house
Even talked about having kids

Got me like the feds, checking on the evidence (he got me yeah yeah)
Checking out where you've been
Come on
What you've been doing with her?
So can we keep it real?
I wanna know everything
So girl tell me everything (oh, tell me everything yeah yeah)⬧
I ain't really tripping (no, no)
But I gotta know...

See woman to woman, I know he ain't right
Looked me in the eyes and lied a thousand times
I can't believe he did this to me
I gave him my heart, so what's it gonna be?
So what'cha, so what'cha, so what'cha gonna do?
So what'cha, so what'cha, so what'cha gonna do?
So what'cha, so what'cha, so what'cha gonna do?
As the day goes by I'm always thinkin' of your face
Your hair, your eyes, your sweet lips and the way they taste
You got me goin' on a high that I have never felt
A beautiful thing, not like the same thing
Let's think we've got it so amazing what I love the most
Is how we can talk and how we laugh and the fact we're so close
It's no illusion but it's magic, no tricks involving
With you I've got it all, you I've got it all
I'm in love, I'm in love, do you hear me?
Was so scared, not prepared but it just hit me
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love and it's a good thing
Many miss out on things, real lover's bring
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love, so in love, baby
In my mind I'm in a world alone, just you and I
You're my Eve and I'm your Adam, so let's start new lives
'Cause the way you make me feel, it's like a new beginning, girl
In all different ways, so many different ways
You have been for with me for my past and the mistakes I've made
You was still strong and had my back, now the foundation's laid
And I wanna spend the rest of my life just fulfilling you
With everything you want, everything you need
I'm in love, I'm in love, do you hear me?
Was so scared, not prepared but it just hit me
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love and it's a good thing
Many miss out on things, real lover's bring
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love, so in love, baby
It's one of those things and it's real hard to explain but
It's real and fills your heart and hearts just don't lie, no
You will know real love 'cause nothin' feels like it and
It touches things inside, it's a real experience
I'm in love, I'm in love, do you hear me?
Was so scared, not prepared but it just hit me
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love and it's a good thing
Many miss out on things, real lover's bring
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love, so in love, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love, do you hear me?
Was so scared, not prepared but it just hit me
Glad it's us, now I'm good, I'm so in love
I'm in love, I'm in love and it's a good thing
Many miss out on things, real lover's bring

, 作词 : Marx, Vandross
,Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence
,My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
,Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep
,Then up the stairs he would carry me
,And I knew for sure I was loved
,
,If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
,I’d play a song that would never, ever end
,How I’d love, love, love
,To dance with my father again
,When I and my mother would disagree
,To get my way, I would run from her to him
,He’d make me laugh just to comfort me
,Then finally make me do just what my mama said
,Later that night when I was asleep
,He left a dollar under my sheet
,Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
,If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him
,I’d play a song that would never, ever end
,‘Cause I’d love, love, love
,To dance with my father again
,Sometimes I’d listen outside her door
,And I’d hear how my mother cried for him
,I pray for her even more than me
,I pray for her even more than me
,I know I’m praying for much too much
,But could you send back the only man she loved
,I know you don’t do it usually
,But dear Lord she’s dying
,To dance with my father again
,Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
,
,Calling my river to let her know Ima be on my way
,Missin how the river flow

Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
A felicidade é como a gota
De orvalho numa pétala de flor
Brilha tranquila
Depois de leve oscila
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A felicidade do pobre parece
A grande ilusão do carnaval
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho
Pra fazer a fantasia
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
A felicidade é como a pluma
Que o vento vai levando pelo ar
Voa tão leve
Mas tem a vida breve
Precisa que haja vento sem parar
A minha felicidade está sonhando
Nos olhos da minha namoradaÉ como esta noite
Passando, passando
Em busca da madrugada
Falem baixo, por favor
Prá que ela acorde alegre como o dia
Oferecendo beijos de amor
Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
Dans un grand jardin enchanté
Tout à coup je me suis retrouvée
Une harpe des violons jouaient
Des anges au ciel me souriaient
Le vent faisait chanter l’été
Je marchais d’un pas si léger
Sur un tapis aux pétales de roses
Une colombe sur mon épaule
Dans chaque main une hirondelle
Des papillons couleurs pastel
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Mais si beau qu’il était vrai
Comme un jour qui se lève
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Un sourire sur mes lèvres
Un sourire que j’ai gardé
Au-delà de mon rêve
Le soleil et ses rayons d’or
Les fleurs dansaient sur un même accord
Des chevaux blancs avec des ailes
Semblaient vouloir toucher le ciel
Vraiment j’étais au pays des fées
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Mais si beau qu’il était vrai
Comme un jour qui se lève
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Un sourire sur mes lèvres
Un sourire que j’ai gardé
Au-delà de mon rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Fin
Cada Palmeira na estrada
Tem uma moça recostada
Uma é minha namorada
E essa estrada vai dar no mar
Cada palma enluarada
Tem que estar quieta, parada
Qualquer canção, quase nada
Vai fazer o dia nascer
Vai fazer o sol levantar
Namorando a madrugada
Eu e minha namorada
Vamos andando na estrada
Que vai dar no avarandado do amanhecer
No avarandado do amanhecer
No avarandado do amanhecer.
Vai minha tristeza 
E diz a ela que 
Sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece 
Que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade
A realidade é que 
Sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza
É só tristeza e a melancolia 
Nue não sai de mim
Não sai de mim
Não sai
Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar 
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca
Dentro dos meus braços os abraços 
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim 
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é prá acabar 
Com esse negócio 
de viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio de você viver sem mim
,
,Chéri,vois-tu je t'aime
,Et dans tes bras je vis un rêve enchanté
,Pourdant j'ai peur quand même
, à la pensée que tu pourrais me quitter
,Sans savoir ce que sera demain
,Ma vie est entre tes mains
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Après toi mon coeur sera fermé pour toujours
,Ici-bas rien ne m'attire que ton sourire
,Ici-bas rien ne m'émeut que tes grands yeux si bleus
,Tout en moi t'appartient sans retour
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Offrir de la tendresse
,Et des baisers qui sans amour ne sont rien
,Gouter d'autres ivresses
,Entre des bras qui me seraient pas les tiens
,Dire encore des mots tendres tout bas
,Non,je ne le pourrais pas
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Après toi mon coeur sera fermé pour toujours

Y calmaras mi sufrir
Porque tú sabes que sin tí
La vida es nada para mí
Tú bien lo sabes
Capullito de aleli
No hay en el mundo para mí
Otro capullo de alelí
Que yo le brinde mi pasión
Y que le dé mi corazón
Porque tú eres la mujer
A quien he dado mi querer
Y te juré lindo alelí
Fidelidad hasta morir
Por eso yo te canto a tí
Mi capullito de alelí
Dame tu aroma seductor
Y un poquito de tu amor
Porque tú sabes que sin tí
La vida es nada para mí
Tú bien lo sabes
Capullito de alelí

Quelques fois je dis des mots bizarres
Quelques fois je parle trop
Et tu me regardes et mon coeur tombe a l'eau
Sometimes I say strange words 
Sometimes I speak too much 
And you look at me and my heart falls into the water
Quelques fois je ris a contretemps
Tu n'y comprends rien de tout
Et tu me regardes etonne tout a coup
Sometimes I laugh at the wrong moment 
You don't understand a thing about it 
And you look at me suddenly surprised
Ne te pose pas trop de questions
La reponse est dans mes yeux
Elle est quelque part au milieu de nous deux
Don't ask yourself too many questions 
The answer is in my eyes 
It is somewhere in between us
Ne m'oublige-je pas a tout te dire
Puisque tu le sais deja
Tout ce que je fais aujourd'hui, , , c'est pour toi
Don't force me to tell you everything 
Since you already know it 
All I do today, , , it's for you
C'est pour toi toi que j'aime encore
C'est pour toi que je suis la
C'est pour toi toi que j'ouvrais mes bras
C'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se melangent tout le temps
C'est pour toi aussi que j'aime les enfants
It's for you that I still love 
It's for you that I am here 
It's for you you that I was opening my arms 
It's for you you that red and white mix all the time 
It's for you also that I love children
Je ne trouve rien de cette fille que j'etais hier encore
Ta presence en moi reveille l'eau qui dort
Je ne connais pas ce que je suis
Je suis quelqu'un de nouveau
Quelqu'un de plus beau et peut-etre plus fort
I don't find anything of that girl I still was yesterday 
Your presence in me awakes the dormant water 
I don't know what I am 
I am someone new 
Someone more beautiful and maybe stronger
C'est pour toi toi que j'aime encore
C'est pour toi que je suis la
C'est pour toi toi que j'ouvrais mes bras
C'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se melangent tout le temps
C'est pour toi aussi que j'aime les enfants
It's for you that I still love 
It's for you that I am here 
It's for you you that I was opening my arms

Quelques fois je parle trop
Et tu me regardes et mon coeur tombe a l'eau
Sometimes I say strange words 
Sometimes I speak too much 
And you look at me and my heart falls into the water

Ansiedad
De tenerte en mis brazos
Musitando palabras de amor... 
Ansiedad
De tener tus encantos
En la boca volverte a besar... 

Tal vez está llorando mi pensamiento
Mis lágrimas son perlas que caen al mar
El eco adormecido de este lamento
Hace que estés presente en mi soñar
Quizás estés llorando al recordarme
Y estreches mi retrato con frenesí

Hasta tu oído llegue la melodía salvaje
Del eco de la pena de estar sin ti...

My Dream Sonata
My dream sonata is the music 
I hearEach night when all the world is deep in slumber,
And in my dreams you suddenly appear
While the music’s playing 
I hear you say,“
I love you, 
I love you.”**
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer,
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music,
That when 
I wake, my darling, you’ll be there.
But when I awaken, you’re gone, it seems.
Like my sonata, you all only in my dreams.(Pick up at **.)
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer,

But when I awaken, you’re gone, it seems.
Like my sonata, you are only in my dreams.
,This is a journey into Sound
,
,Substantial and Nujabes
,Still doing this
,Yeah
,
,Sorry love
,Sorry love
,Sorry love
,But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us
,
,
,Me and you is a blessing see
,Sorry, sweetheart we can never be
,The little things you do be depressin' me
,Still, baby girl, we can never be
,You only want one night of ecstasy
,Thanks but no thanks it can never be
,Cause I got a wife at home that I'm blessed to keep
,And to fool around with you would be the death of me
,Can't have the ingredients of the recipe
,Cause it isn't fair to you nor fair to me
,And more importantly
,It sure isn't fair to her
,Guess we might've had a chance before I married her
,Cause wifey is worth more than life to me
,A soulmate
,Who am I to control fate?
,Cause somebody like you is much more than a cud buddy
,But I can't give you all the things that you want from me
,So...
,
,
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us

,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us
,
,
,I know you think I'll be the perfect man
,But it seems like the most I have ever pleased
,Besides I'm no better than my brotha man
,Can't run around like Mr. Lover Man
,Tryin' to maintain
,Spend the rest of my life with the same dame
,That's right, uh
,Found the right one
,Sounds like fun
,But I ain't this and that
,Cause if I lose her, slim chance I'll get her back
,This is real life
,This ain't cinemax
,Tryin' get my little seats filled
,People feelin' packed
,On these hardwood floors
,On this house we own
,They get hot, we know
,But it's not for show
,Not that anything's the matter with you
,But there's no guarantee that I'm compatible with you
,And I can't make you into something you're not
,Know people look around for what they already got
,So...
,
,
,I ain't tryin' to
,Waste your time, boo
,I know you've been stepped on
,And been lied to
,God bless the next man who's lucky to find you
,It's hard to sep the ties
,But, baby, I got to
,Uh, that's the way it is
,I know you don't know what to think of this
,And I'm really sorry that it came to this
,Feels like an endless break it is
,Cause I think it's easier that way
,That's passe
,And it hurts like a bad date
,And the pressure is enough to make a back break
,But to lead you on would be mad fake
,So do your thing, baby
,I'll do mine
,Don't worry 'bout me, girl
,I'll be fine
,This is all my fault
,I'm too kind
,And a decent human being's hard to find
,
,
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,We can't be, we won't be
,Sorry love
,But it seems like it isn't in the cards for us
,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To see you once again
,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To call you once again

,Yeah
,So as long there’s a leave we gotta let you
,Know that as long as there’s a stage for me to step to
,Fly to the moons and Neptune
,Nobody except you will ever come close like I pulled the thunks out, the heart strings
,Then you played it like a harp now my heart sings
,When you hiding in the shadows my heart sinks
,And the farther you drift I can't think can’t quite gone empty
,Whatever happened to the field gives plenty
,Whenever I caught a glimpse of you parted pull my arm will descending
,The upside down in this vertigo
,Too many choices can leave you stranded
,The world in your palm is still and I understand it
,I’m still charged at looking for an outlet
,I have forgotten where we met
,That I've finally found that

,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To see you once again
,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To call you once again

,Uh
,So many variables
,But I want you to be the constant, my North star
,Who needs a pickup line
,When you’re the one that picks me up and the star's align
,C’mon
,It's called a sesergy more like a synergy
,So many wise well will ask why
,I don’t have for the answer just educated guesses
,A message would lessen this sessions with essence
,You know the less is more sometimes when i reminisce about the past
,For times and everyday its fair but now
,Sunshine, can't avoid it like a play can be
,Cause I when i try to verbalize is that
,No matter how fast the clock and chronicle flies
[02:14For good is this spot your name occupies
,I've done sitting on porcupines
,Imma call you mine

,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To see you once again
,All these years
,I’ve been waiting for you babe
,To call you once again
,All these years

,My space and hours
,The longest silence
,Devours the remnants of our lavish encounters
,Where does it all go if the energy bursts in us concern
,Waiting like planes by the windows of watch towers
,And I remember the night
,The space was ours

,You didn’t open up to me
,I could feel that in your eyes
,Was sad interlude
,They touch me deep inside
,I could feel that in you now
,Was a sad interlude

,
,I can change if You want me to
,I can change if I trust in You
,'Cause I know all these things are possible with You
,
,I remember, tears flowing, I would ask God
,"If this is how You made me, how can I be flawed?
,I don’t remember asking You that I would be this way
,Do You even listen to my heart when I pray?"
,If it’s so wrong, why does it feel good?
,the voices tell me that I'm simply misunderstood
,Being my way, versus being what I should
,Doing what You say is right, versus what I really would
,I feel the laws of the universe in my veins
,Pumping white and black oxygen to my brain
,Breathin'life with a hidden undertone of shame
,I feel the wickedness trying to evict Your holy reign
,So even if it feels natural, impossible
,I know true inspiration is in the improbable
,So I trust that I might be wrong
,And true life is what I really long for
,I can change if You want me to
,I can change if I trust in You
,'Cause I know all these things are possible with You
,I will change if You want me to
,I will change 'cause I trust in You
,And I know anything is possible with You
,And I know that I am not the only one
,The war within my chest leaves me undone
,Maybe I am far too gone to change
,So look at all my mess and my debris
,I'm asking that You help me, honestly
,'Cause I don't want my love to waste away
,I can change if You want me to
,I can change if I trust in You
,'Cause I know all these things are possible with You
,I will change if You want me to
,I will change 'cause I trust in You
,And I know anything is possible with You
,
,I can change if You want me to
,I can change if I trust in You
,'Cause I know all these things are possible with You
,I will change if You want me to
,I will change 'cause I trust in You
,And I know anything is possible with You
,I can change if You want me to
,I can change if I trust in You
,'Cause I know all these things are possible with You

It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she don't live there no more
And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
Get away from here
Too early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me, she said, B., you sure look beat
It's early in the morning, baby
Early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out
Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues
It's early in the morning
I ain't got nothin' but the blues

,I dreamed i did a good job and i got well paid
,I Blew it all at the penny arcade
,A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
,I guess no white chick is gonna make me crawl
,On a twa, to the promised land
,Every woman, child and man
,Gets a cadillac and a diamond ring
,Dont you know we're riding with the king?
,Hes on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
,Hes gonna check us all on out of here
,Up to that mansion on a hill
,Where you can get your prescription filled, any kind of pill
,On a twa to the promised land
,Everybody come on and clap your hands
,Dont you just love the way he sings
,Dont you know we're riding with the king?
,Tuxedo and a shiny  three thirty five.
,You can see it in his face the blues is his life
,Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
,Dont you know we're riding with the king?
,I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
,With a suit cut sharp, as a razor and a heart of gold
,I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
,I'm gonna play that thing until the day i die

,Album: Rattle and Hum
,Title: When Love Comes To Town
,I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
,I was under the waves
,Before love rescued me
,I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
,Now I stand accused of the things I've said
,Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,I used to make love under a red sunset
,I was making promises I was soon to forget
,She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
,But I left her standing before love came to town
,I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
,The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
,As the music played I saw my life turn around
,That was the day before love came to town
,When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,I was there when they crucified my Lord
,I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
,I threw the dice when they pierced his side
,But I've seen love conquer the great divide
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
,When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
,Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
,But I did what I did before love came to town
,
,
,it's the sugar so sweet

Music: Dream Theater
Helpless child
They invite your hands to fill their needs
Will you be the same
Shameless smile
To steal from you the innocence that bleeds
Will they feel your pain
Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone
She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna lee
Behind those eyes
The vivid scene
A lucid dream within
Questioned secrets are revealed
And everytime
You can't deny
The lines that trace your skin
Wounds that never heal
Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone
She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong
Anna Lee
And now she's calling out a name
Can't keep on hiding all her pain
You feel the rain move in
As you begin
To turn and answer the call
Trying to believe
The scars unseen
The tears wash clean
You don't wanna breathe the air you breathe
You don't know how you'll live a life alone
She keeps holding on
Holding on to you
Let her breathe the air
Don't wanna be alone where do you belong

作词 : London
Well I've cried so much for you 
Baby, there's nothing new 
Well, I've cried so much for you 
Baby that's nothing new 
Now I wish I had one dollar 
For all the times I've cried for you 
Almost every night
I cry myself to sleep
Everybody else is happy 
But I'll just weep, weep, weep 
And these tears, tears, tears 
Why won't they let me be?
Now I wish just once 
You'd cry for me 
(Guitar solo)
Oh, yes!
Yeah!
Why should I remember?
How can I forget?
I wake up every morning 
And my pillow is soaking wet 
From these tears, tears, tears 
Why won't they let me be?
Now I wish just once 
You'd cry for me 
(Guitar outro)
Oh, yeah!
Yes!
Yes, yes, yeah!
Cry for me
Tracy Chapman: Give Me One Reason

Give me one reason to stay here,
And I'll turn right back around.
Said I don't want leave you lonely,
You got to make me change my mind.
Baby I got your number and I know that you got mine.
But you know that I called you, I called too many times.
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime.
But you got to call me.
I don't want no one to squeeze me,
They might take away my life.
I just want someone to hold me and rock me through the night.
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need.
This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need.
But I'm too old to go chasing you around,
Wasting my precious energy.
Baby just give me one reason.
Give me just one reason why.
Baby just give me one reason.
Give me just one reason why I should stay.
Said I told you that I loved you,
And there ain't no more to say.

作词 : Weller
A clock face ticking on empty dial 
I only want what 
I know is mine 
Sound the bells ‘
Cause here’s the good new 
Here’s the one you been waiting for 
Your time has come 
Ain’t gonna wait no more 
Can I get a piece for me 
You know when something’s up 
When it hits you hard 
You feel like starting over 
Straight back for yards 
When everything is everything 
And everything you see 
Sees us doing all the things 
That we want to be 
Millions march back on their feet 
Still no sign from, a, those who preach 
Teach me not 
They don’t represent me 
Here’s the one you been waiting for 
Don’t waste time 
Ain’t gonna wait no more 
Can I get a shout for me 
You know when something’s up 
When it hits you hard 
You feel like starting over 
Straight back for yards 
When everything is everything 
And everything you see 
Sees us doing all the things 
That we want to be 
Nothing’s new and nothing gained 
When all is lost and nothing claimed 
Except the parts 
They keep for theirselves 
Here’s the one you been waiting for 
Don’t waste time 
Ain’t gonna wait no more 
Can I get a shout for me 
Can I get a little piece for me 
For me Oh, for me 
For me

,Is happiness real?
,Or am I so jaded
,I can't see or feel - like a man been tainted
,Numbed by the effect - aware of the muse
,Too in touch with myself - I light the fuse
,I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands
,I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-
,As I light a bitter fuse
,
,Time is on loan - only ours to borrow
,What I can't be today - I can be tomorrow
,And the more I see - the more I know
,The more I know - the less I understand.
,I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands
,I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-
,To light a bitter fuse
,
,It's a bigger part -
,When our instincts act
,
,A shot in the dark -
,A movement in black
,
,And the more I see - the more I know
,The more I know - the less I understand.
,
,built on shifting sands
,（I don't have a plan）
,I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-
,To light a bitter fuse
,
,built on shifting sands
,I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-

,ou do something to me - something deep inside
,I hanging on the wire - with love I never find
,
,You do something wonderful - then chase it all away

,People fly by in the traffics boom
,Knowing just where you're blowing
,Getting to where you should be going
,Don't let them get you down
,Making you feel guilty about
,Golden rain will bring you riches
,All the good things you deserve now, right now
,Climbing, forever trying
,Find your way out of the wild wild wood
,Now there's no justice
,Only yourself that you can trust in
,And I said, high tide, mid afternoon
,People fly by in the traffics boom
,Knowing just where you're blowing
,Getting to where you should be going, yeah
,Day by day your world fades away

,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by

,One summer night
,We ran away for a while
,Laughing we hurried beneath the sky
,To an obscure place to hide
,That no-one could find
,And we drifted to another state of mind
,And imagined I was yours and you were mine
,As we lay upon the grass
,There in the dark
,Underneath the stars
,（Young love）
,Underneath the stars
,（Young love）
,Oh baby
,Weak in the knees
,Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
,So shy a bundle of butterflies
,Flush with heat of desire
,On a natural high
,As we drifted to another place in time
,And the feeling was so heady and sublime
,As I lost my heart to you
,There in the dark
,Underneath the stars
,（Young love）
,（Shum do do do）
,Beautiful and bittersweetly
,You were fading into me
,And I was gently fading into you
,But the time went sailing by
,Reluctantly we said goodbye
,And left our secret place so far behind
,And I lay in bed all night
,And I was drifting
,Drifting
,Drifting
,Drifting
,Drifting
,And I was yours
,And you were my own
,My own baby
,As we lay
,As we
,Lay underneath the stars
,（Young love）
,Ohhhhh
,（Young love）
,Underneath the stars
,（Shum do do do）
,Underneath the stars
,（Young love）
,Underneath the stars

,Hurts me the most when I wake
,I fumble and twist, 'til the truth starts to click
,There's so much space in this bed
,These sheets go for miles, dreams of your smile
,I don't wanna be just a memory
,And I don't wanna feel your wings break free
,Because without you I'm lost in the breeze
,I gotta be strong now, I gotta show you how
,I'll love you like I've never, ever loved somebody
,I'll give you things you didn't even know you wanted
,Don't tell me that it's not enough
,My time is up, you're over us
,Cause I think I might do anything for you
,If you just let me, if you just let me
,If you just let me, just let me
,Taste of your lips is still fresh
,And the smell of your scent, how could I forget?
,Your words how they cut me to shreds
,But to tell you the truth every piece is for you
,I don't wanna be just a memory
,And I don't wanna feel your wings break free
,Because without you I'm lost in the breeze

,I remember when you use to take me on a
,Bike ride everyday on the bayou
,(You remember that? We were inseparable)
,And I remember when you could do no wrong
,You'd come home from work
,and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
,I was so happy to see you
,(I was so excited, so happy to see you)
,Because you loved me I overcome
,And I'm so proud of what you've become
,You've given me such security
,No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
,You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
,You understood my fears and you protected me
,Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…
,I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
,I want my husband to be like my daddy
,There is no one else like my daddy
,And I thank you for loving me
,I still remember the expression on your face
,When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
,(My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
,I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
,Could have said Beyonce I told you so
,Instead you said you'd get one too
,(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)
,Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
,I appreciate what you do
,You've given me such security
,No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
,You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
,You understand my fears and you protected me
,Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…
,I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
,I want my husband to be like my daddy
,There is no one else like my daddy
,And I thank you for loving me
,Even if my man broke my heart today
,No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
,Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
,For this love is unconditional it won't go away
,I know I'm lucky
,Know it ain't easy
,For men who take care of their responsibilities
,Love is overwhelming
,Can't help my tears from falling
,I love you so much daddy
,(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)
,I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
,I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
,There is no one else like my daddy
,No one else replace my daddy...

,I will run, I will climb, I will soar
,I’m undefeated
,Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
,Yeah I believe it
,The past, is everything we were don’t make us who we are
,So I’ll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible
,I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
,Until I’m breaking, until I’m breaking
,Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
,I know I’m changing, I know I’m changing
,In, into something big, better than before
,And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
,Then It’s worth fighting for
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible
,From the bottom to the top
,We’re sparking wild fire’s
,Never quit and never stop
,The rest of our lives
,From the bottom to the top
,We’re sparking wild fire’s

,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible possible
,Your fingertips across my skin
,The palm trees swaying in the wind
,Images
,You sang me Spanish lullabies
,The sweetest sadness in your eyes
,Clever trick
,Well, I never want to see you unhappy
,I thought you'd want the same for me
,Goodbye, my almost lover
,Goodbye, my hopeless dream
,I'm trying not to think about you
,Can't you just let me be?
,So long, my luckless romance
,My back is turned on you
,Should've known you'd bring me heartache
,Almost lovers always do
,We walked along a crowded street
,You took my hand and danced with me
,Images
,And when you left, you kissed my lips
,You told me you would never, never forget
,These images
,No

,I cannot go to the ocean
,I cannot drive the streets at night
,I cannot wake up in the morning
,Without you on my mind
,So you're gone and I'm haunted
,And I bet you are just fine
,Did I make it that
,Easy to walk right in and out
,Of my life?

,Sometimes it lasts in love
,But sometimes it hurts instead
,Sometimes it lasts in love

,Of our glory days

,Who would have known
,How bitter sweet
,This would taste
,Never mind
,I'll find someone like you

,For you

,Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
,She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home
,I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
,To carry love to carry children of our own
,We are still kids but we're so in love
,Fighting against all odds
,I know we'll be alright this time
,Darling just hold my hand
,Be my girl I'll be your man
,I see my future in your eyes
,Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
,Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song
,When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
,I don't deserve this
,Darling you look perfect tonight, tonight, tonight, ooh ooh
,Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
,Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song
,I have faith in what I see
,I know I have met an angel in person
,You look perfect I don't deserve this
,You look perfect tonight

,I fall in love too easily
,I fall in love too fast
,I fall in love too terribly hard
,For love to ever last
,My heart should be well schooled
,For I've been fooled than a past
,But still I fall in love too easily
,I fall in love too fast
,I fall in love too easily
,I fall in love too fast
,I fall in love too terribly hard
,For love to ever last
,My heart should be well schooled
,For I've been fooled than a past
,But still I fall in love too easily

I will always love Liangliang

Here they come
Every night the same
Silent stars
Light from a distant flame
Just like the memories of you
That I hold inside
I see you touch
But all the warmth has died
Empty rooms
Crowded by the past
Time is my enemy
Days keep moving faster
But the nights alone can be
An eternity
That never heals the scars
Of foolish pride
If only you could see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break
And you would free me now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me now
Here I am
Stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears
Missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you
On that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away
If you could only see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
I know your heart would break
If you could hear me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could hear me once
Hoping love will bring you back
If only you could see me now
Like the lonely moon
You see above
That sails the dark alone
Forever
I have no light of my own
Other the love we've known
So long ago
Together
If you could feel me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could touch me once
I know love will bring you back
If only you could see me now

,Jack made his frost this morning
,The only man still working in town
,Despite the cold of his art
,There's a warmth to his heart
,I think it must be Christmas today
,Snow fall comes softly tumbling
,Mr Robin has something to say
,The Mistletoe is gleaming
,Soft lips come stealing
,I think it must be Christmas today
,If the stars seem to shine less brightly
,If the man on the moon has lost his way
,They have no fear
,They are somewhere here
,They've just gone home for Christmas day
,Homes keeping warm by firelight
,Telling tales of Rudolph and his sleigh
,There's tinsel on the ceiling
,I've got a feeling
,I think it must be Christmas
,I think it must be Christmas today

,And then there was you
,And then there was you my dear
,I thought love was a game one would win or would lose
,Until I found you
,Until I found you my dear
,I thought love was a shame so I threw it away
,And then there was you
,I thought I was right
,But now it seems I was wrong
,I just waited so long and I feared love had gone
,And then there was you

,The plot begins with you
,And me in dark lit rooms
,Your cigarette cuts through
,I wear it like perfume
,The melody gives way
,We silently behave
,The story never ends
,Is torn up into shreds
,I see it in your eyes
,Invitation lies
,Book pages left to turn
,Our chapters we should burn
,The melody gives way

,Is torn up into shreds

,Passing by in candy street
,I dreamed I was your sweetie
,A sugar doll is what I wish to be
,So you’d see me
,I’d turn you on
,Oh you’d be my boogie man
,My sugar lamb
,My Christmas cake
,My cube of ice on lemongrass
,We wouldn’t see the time would pass
,But again
,This salty rain
,And all those
,Grey, grey clouds in my brain
,I guess I’m just the queen of pain
,I’m just the queen of pain
,So bye bye
,Sugar lamb
,Bye bye
,Honey pie
,Bye bye
,Boogie man
,Misty kingdoms call me again
,I am not your toy
,So bye bye funny boy
,Bye bye boogie man
,Misty kingdoms call me again
,Passing by an Irish Coffee
,I dreamed I was your favorite cocktail
,Your Margarita
,Your Bloody Mary
,I’d cast a spell along your trail
,Oh you’d be my blue lagoon
,My tequila sunrise
,My cup of dreams under the moon
,My Champagne in paradise
,A sugar doll and queen of pain
,I change so fast and all is vain
,I guess I’m just the queen of pain
,Oh, today I’m just the queen of pain

,Goodbye
,It is all over now
, You've been gone before
,But this time it's over
,There's no more to say
,You're not coming back
,You just closed the door
,Leaving me alone now
,Oh
,Was it just a dream
,Never really ture
,Why am i so lonely
,Oh so lonely
,Please come back to me
,Come
,If it's one more time
,Come

,Even just to say just to say goodbye
,Lately
,I find myself out gazing at stars
,Hearing guitars
,Like someone in love
,Sometimes the things I do astound me
,Mostly whenever you're around me
,Lately
,I seem to walk as though I have wings
,Bump into things
,Like someone in love
,Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
,And feeling like someone in love
,Lately
,I seem to walk as though I have wings

,I only needed a soul
,To share to kiss and to hold
,But only found this dark hole
,Someone unbearably cold
,And though I tried to reach through
,Tried to see what makes you you
,You closed all windows and doors
,Saw me for only my flaws
,They say that time heals all wounds
,I can't say from what I've seen that it's true
,Regrets and pain follow you
,Until there's no one to help and nothing you can do
,And if my dreams would come true
,I'd be there looking at you
,And as you start to undo
,I'll hold a mirror to you
,My only solaces is
,You'll never feel such a kiss
,You'll never know what you missed
,You'll never experience true bliss

,What a waste, I could've been your lover
,What a waste, I could've been your friend
,Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
,When it's blowing up a storm in May
,Travel south until your skin turns, woman
,Travel south until your skin turns brown
,Put a language in your head and get on a train
,And then come back to the one you love
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part
,Of this lifetime of dreaming
,That extends to the heart
,Of this long summer feeling
,Quiet night you see the tv's glowing
,Quiet night,you here the walls are awake
,Being you, I'm getting out of a party crowd
,Can I see what's underneath your bed?
,Can I stay until the milkman's working?
,Can I stay until the café awakes?
,Do you hate me in the light? Did you get a fright?
,When you looked across from where you lay
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part
,Of this lifetime of dreaming
,That extends to the heart
,Of this long summer feeling
,All the history of wars I invent in my head

,Can you take me the looking glass
,Let me turn my vision from all the things past
,Noetic my nature poetic is my folly
,Aesthetics of my sutures symbolic of my calling
,My perception of every fine line
,Is affected expression the artist in mind
,And I'm in time but your vision transcends
,Yet still you involve your will in my ends
,I admit that only a small part I see
,A small fish tryinto envision the whole sea
,And I want to be a visionary bringer of the light
,But many times I feel like
,I'm blind preaching a sight
,That I don't have
,Theres a portion of me lackin
,Telling me to seek a darkness to go back in
,But you reassure me to take heart
,For your light is the catalyst in my mind the spark
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same

,The rhythm of the rains or where their winds sway
,But I find it all futile a figment of my fears
,It all futile a figment of my tears
,Then the sun sets in the night there I see
,The moon shining in the black canvas for me
,So I choose to believe in the message of the sky
,The rising of the son is my only true guide
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony

,James Morrison - If The Rain Must Fall
,Oh life can be strange
,Good and bad in so many ways
,And in time you will find
,That things are not always what they seem
,Well i've got something to say
,But you might laugh, joke or run away
,Coz i'm awkward and nervous
,Sometimes i dont say much at all
,But if the rain must fall
,If i lose it all
,If the world comes down and takes my soul
,If the sky turns black
,And there's no no way back
,It won't matter much to me
,If i had you
,All i need is your love
,That's all i need
,All i need is your love
,Oh well dreams can come true
,if you know inside you really want them to
,or you can sit you can wait
,You can leave your fate in someone elses hands
,Oh but I, I want you
,And nothing else can make me feel the way you do
,So i'm waiting, i'm wishing
,That it's me
,you'll be holding tonight and every night
,But if the rain must fall
,If i lose it all
,If the world comes down and takes my soul
,If the sky turns black
,And there's no no way back
,It won't matter much to me
,If i had you
,All i need is your love
,All i need is your love
,But if the rain must fall
,If i lose it all
,If the world comes down and takes my soul
,If the sky turns black
,And there's no no way back
,It won't matter much to me
,If i had you

,laughed much louder than the others
,and our bellies,
,they filled with light!
,Berlin,

,Oooooh, Berlin!
,Sometimes darkness, it creeps in-

Let go of your love
Ride his pulse and you forget
Slow down, your time will come
If not tonight, surely by the dawn
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
A cat's eye, a lizard's tail
The pentagram, he bought in hell
He stalks the night with no intent
His brow sweets for innocence
And take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
The rain's soul makes kill and cry
He wants desperately to die
But fast and skillfully forgets
He's back on the street with no regrets
Just take it like a man
The strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
To the strange face of love
Don't look back, don't look back
He's right on your trail
Don't look back, don't look back
He's just a step away from hell
Don't look back, don't look back
Into the strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange face of love
Strange, strange

Down the road you go

, I'm 14 years old, I'm pretty
, I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady
, I live under the kitchen floor
, Right here, not so far from you.
, Sometimes I feel happy
, Sometimes I feel blue
, In my dreams O I wish I could...
, Feel my hair blowing in the wind
, See the sky and the summer rain
, Pick a flower from the garden for you
, Beyond the lane there's another world
, Butterflies floating in the air
, But is there someone out there for me?
, And so life goes on, day after day
, With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies
, I live in a tiny world ( live in a tiny world)
, But out there, someone waits for me.
, I wish I had someone to watch over me
, In my dreams O I wish I could...
, Feel my hair blowing in the wind
, See the sky and the summer rain
, Pick a flower from the garden for you
, Now I know there's another world
, Butterflies floating in the air
, There is someone out there for me.

,By an old drinking well on the grass so green
,I lay down and fell into a dream
,By a strange mellow sound from a silver eyed bird
,I opened my eyes but said no word
,On the pathway came walking a woman so bold
,Behind her in silence went the old
,
,Ahead ran the children with joyful cries
,Their faces were lifted to the skies
,The woman's hair was raven and black as the night
,Covered with stars shining bright
,As they passed by the well I saw that their eyes
,Were flaming like many coloured ice
,They passed by the well like a breeze pure and clean
,Soon they were nowhere to be seen
,
,When I woke up alone on the grass so green
,I looked into the well to catch the dream
,The water was rising and I felt a chill
,I willed the water to be still
,There was a face in the mirror like a face out of time
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,There was a face in the mirror
,and the face wasn't mine
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,
,True you ride the finest horse
,I've ever seen
,Standing sixteen one or two
,With eyes wild and green
,You ride the horse so well
,Hands light to the touch
,I could never go with you
,No matter how I wanted to
,Ride on, see you
,I could never go with you
,No matter how I wanted to
,Ride on, see you
,I could never go with you
,No matter how I wanted to
,When you ride into the night
,Without out a trace behind
,Run your claw along my gush
,One last time
,I turn to face an empty space
,Where you used to lie
,And look for the spark that lights the night
,Through the teardrop in my eye
,Ride on, see you
,I could never go with you
,No matter how I wanted to
,Ride on, see you
,I could never go with you

The Star Spangled Banner
Oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare!
The bombs bursting in air!
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave?

,Hello.
,Is there anybody in there?
,Just nod if you can hear me.
,Is there anyone home?
,Come on, now.
,I hear you're feeling down.
,Well I can ease your pain,
,Get you on your feet again.
,Relax.
,I need some information first.
,Just the basic facts:
,Can you show me where it hurts?
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I had a fever.
,My hands felt just like two balloons.
,Now I got that feeling once again.
,I can't explain, you would not understand.
,This is not how I am.
,I have become comfortably numb.
,Ok.
,Just a little pinprick. <ping>
,There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
,But you may feel a little sick.
,Can you stand up?
,I do believe it's working. Good.
,That'll keep you going for the show.
,Come on it's time to go.
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
,Out of the corner of my eye.
,I turned to look but it was gone.
,I cannot put my finger on it now.
,The child is grown, the dream is gone.
,I have become comfortably numb.
,
,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
,You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
,Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
,Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
,
,Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
,You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
,And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
,No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
,
,And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
,And racing around to come up behind you again
,The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
,Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
,
,Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
,Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
,Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
,The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
,
,Home, home again
,I like to be here when I can
,And when I come home cold and tired
,It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
,Far away across the field
,The tolling of the iron bell
,Calls the faithful to their knees
,To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
,
,So
,So you think you can tell
,Heaven from Hell
,Blue skies from pain
,Can you tell a green field
,From a cold steel rail?
,A smile from a veil?
,Do you think you can tell?
,And did they get you to trade
,Your heroes for ghosts?
,Hot ashes for trees?
,Hot air for a cool breeze?
,Cold comfort for change?
,And did you exchange
,A walk on part in the war
,For a lead role in a cage?
,How I wish
,How I wish you were here
,We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
,Year after year
,Running over the same old ground
,What have we found?
,The same old fears
,Wish you were here
,Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
,Somewhere in this town
,See me and the boys we dont like it

,And it's whispered that soon
,If we all call the tune
,Then the piper will lead us to reason.
,And a new day will dawn

,And the forests will echo with laughter.

,In case you don't know,
,The piper's calling you to join him,
,Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
,And did you know
,Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
,And as we wind on down the road
,Our shadows taller than our soul.
,There walks a lady we all know
,Who shines white light and wants to show
,How ev'rything still turns to gold.
,And if you listen very hard
,The tune will come to you at last.
,When all are one and one is all
,To be a rock and not to roll.

It's the dog in the park
It's the fog after dark
It's the wind in your hair
It's the keys that you left
After giving your best
It's the thought as I walk
It's like taking sips from your cup of coffee
Smoking a cigarette after dinner time
It's like making love on Egyptian cotton
All in all it
We'll be fine
Feels good
It feels good
Feels good
It feels good
So good
Feels so good
It feels so good
You know it feels so good
It's a song in your head
Eating chocolate in bed
It's a bird up in flight
A divine melody
Glass of wine
Burgundy
It's the love of your life
It's like
It's like taking sips from your cup of coffee
Smoking a cigarette after dinner time
It's like making love on Egyptian cotton
On and on and
We'll be fine
Feels good
(Feels good, you know)
It feels good
(You know it feels good)
Feels good
(Oh, you know it feels)
It feels good
No doubt
We got a love think
That's definitely here to stay
One thing I do have to say is
That in each and every way
Feels good
So good
So good
Feels good
(Hum, you know it feels)
It feels good
(Oh you know that)
Feels good
(Oh you know it feels good)
It feels good
Feels so good

This land is your land 
This land is my land
From California to the 
New York island;
From the red wood forest to the 
Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and 
Me.As I was walking that ribbon of highway,
I saw above me that endless skyway:
I saw below me that golden valley:
This land was made for you and me.
I've roamed and rambled and 
I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;
And all around me a voice was sounding:
This land was made for you and me.
When the sun came shining, and 
I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,
A voice was chanting and the fog was lifting:
This land was made for you and me.

  There's a place where lovers go
 To cry their troubles away
 And they call it Lonesome Town
 Where the broken hearts stay
 
 You can buy a dream or two
 To last you all through the years
 And the only price you pay
 Is a heart full of tears
 
 Goin' down to lonesome town
 Where the broken hearts stay
 Goin' down to lonesome town
 To cry my troubles away
 
 In the town of broken dreams
 The streets are filled with regret
 Maybe down in lonesome town
 I can learn to forget
 
 Maybe down in lonesome town
 I can learn to forget

,If you wake me up tonight

,As they pick me up again
,They will be there on the couch
,They will make you better still
,（can you be sure?）
,Of anything you make
,Maybe you can get a whiff
,It's enough to make you gag
,It's enough to make you sick
,Each and every day
,With the concrete and the masonry
,When the paint that's on is dry
,You can work it from your eye
,And you take it from my heart
,As you stand alone forever
,From the roaming and the surf
,And the cloudy cloudy day
,Just a boss thing that is pure
,Something specially for you
,It's like everybody's needing it
,And everybody's sure

Signal Hill
Jon Mark
mosMos
,The leaves begin to fall
,Golden in the sun
,I see the children run on the signal hill
,When winters on my mind
,I'll leave it all behind
,The happiness I find on the signal hill
,If she wasn't there at all to hear me when I call
,I'd never think of staying on the signal hill
,
,Time is mine to hope and the days are rich and green
,And beautiful my queen on the signal hill
,I lay beside her now
,And thoughts come to my mind of one I left behind on the signal hill
,If she wasn't there at all to hear me when I call
,I'd never think of leaving my signal hill
,
,The love I have is real
,And the love I take I steal
,But still for her I fail
,I see the autumn rain so part will still remain
,Of my fogotten name on the signal hill
,If she wasn't there at all to hear me when I call
,I never think of leaving my signal hill
,
,But at least I see the fall of signal hill
,I started out in search of ordinary things
,How much of a tree bends in the wind
,I started telling the story without knowing the end
,I used to be darker, then I got lighter, then I got dark again
,Something to be seen was passing over and over me
,Well it seemed like the routine case at first
,With the death of the shadow came a lightness of verse
,But the darkest of nights, in truth, still dazzles
,And I wore myself until I'm frazzled
,I ended up in search of ordinary things
,Like how can a wave possibly be?
,I started running, and the concrete turned to sand
,I started running, and things didn't pan out as planned
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,In case things go poorly and I not return
,Remember the good things I've done
,Done me in
,You'er just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you
,You'd be like heaven to touch
,I wanna hold you so much
,At long last love has arrived
,And I thank God I'm alive
,You're just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you
,Pardon the way that I stare
,There's nothing else to compare
,The sight of you leaves me weak
,There are no words left to speak
,But if you feel like I feel
,Please let me know that it's real
,You're just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you
,I love you baby,and if it's quite all right
,I need you baby to warm the lonely night
,I love you baby
,Trust in me when I say (it's) ok
,Oh pretty baby,don't let me down,I pray
,Oh pretty baby,now that I found you stay
,And let me love you,oh baby,Let me love you, oh baby
,You'er just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you
,You'd be like heaven to touch
,I wanna hold you so much
,At long last love has arrived
,And I thank God I'm alive
,You're just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you

,I love you baby
,Trust in me when I say (it's) ok
,Oh pretty baby,don't let me down,I pray
,Oh pretty baby,now that I found you stay
,And let me love you,oh baby,Let me love you, oh baby
,Just a song we shared, I'll hear
,Brings memories back when you were here
,
,Of your smiles, your easy laughter
,Of your kiss, those moments after
,I think of you
,And think of you
,
,And think of you
,
,Of the dreams we dreamt together
,Of the love we vowed would never
,Melt like snowflakes in the sun
,My days now end as they begun:
,With thoughts of you
,
,And I think of you
,
,And think of you
,
,Down the streets I walked with you
,Seeing others doing things we do
,
,Now these thoughts are haunting me
,Of how complete I used to be
,
,And in these times that we're apart
,
,I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
,And think of you
,
,And I think of you
,
,And think of you

Well, a curly-headed girl with a bright shining smile
Heard the roar of a plane as it sailed through the sky
To her playmates she said, with a bright twinkling eye
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Mama's not afraid and neither am 
I'Cause my 
Daddy flies that ship in the sky
Then a button-nosed kid, as he kicked up his heels
He said, My 
Daddy works in the iron and the steel
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high
Then a freckle-faced kid pinched his toe in the sand
He says, My 
Daddy works at that place where they land
You tell your mama, don't be afraid
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again
Don't be afraid when it gets dark and rains
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again

,I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
,For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
,When I pass by, all the people say
,"Just another guy on the lost highway"
,Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
,And a woman's lies make a life like mine
,Oh, the day we met, I went astray
,I started rollin' down that lost highway
,I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
,Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
,And now I'm lost, too late to pray

Come here sister, papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip about that new breed babe
He ain't no drag, papa's got a brand new bag
Come here mama and dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy but his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag, papa's got a brand new bag
He's doing the jerk, he's doing the fly, don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy, he's doing the monkey
The mashed potatoes, jump back Jack, see you later alligator
Come here sister, papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now but I can dig that new breed, babe
He ain't no drag, he's got a brand new bag
Oh papa, he's doing the jerk, papa, he's doing the jerk
He's doing the twist, just like this, he's doing the fly
Every day and every night, the thing's like the boomerang

  Regrets
 
 
 I wish that i could take back
 All of the things that i've done to hurt you!
 I didn't mean to be so cruel!
 And yet i know that i've been selfish
 And, at times, a just fool!
 
 And every thoughtless thing i've done
 Keeps comin' back to haunt me
 Because you took each one to heart!
 And as i realize it's my fault
 We've grown worlds apart . . .
 
 I have regrets, regrets,
 For my mistakes an' thinking only of my self
 And all that i have left are these regrets, regrets,
 For the things i did that somehow you just can't forgive
 I guess i'll always have to live with these regrets
 
 If i could right the wrong i've done
 Maybe i could stop your leavin'
 But there's so much i'm guilty of
 And it's too late to say i'm sorry
 'cause bein' sorry is not enough!
 
 'cause with each angry word that i've said
 Your love for me was dyin',
 Each word left a lasting scar
 And right now i feel so helpless,
 Wishin' i could change the way things are . . .
 
 I have regrets, regrets,
 For my mistakes an' thinking only of my self
 And all that i have left are these regrets, regrets,
 For the things i did that somehow you just can't forgive
 I guess i'll always have to live with these regrets . . .

,And by the Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
,Don't say it was a good thing
,Don't say it's the right thing to do

,Yes, I do, I believe
,That one day I will be where I was
,Right there, right next to you
,And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
,The moon, the stars are nothing without you
,Your touch, your skin,
,Where do I begin?
,No words can explain the way I’m missing you
,Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
,These tears, they tell their own story
,You told me not to cry when you were gone
,But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,And make sure you’re alright?
,I’ll take care of you,
,And I don’t want to be here
,if I can’t be with you tonight
,I’m reaching out to you
,Can you hear my call? (who's to say you won't hear me?)
,This hurt that I’ve been through

,Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,You and me we made a vow
,For better or for worse
,I can't believe you let me down
,But the proof is in the way it hurts
,For months on end I've had my doubts
,Denying every tear
,I wish this would be over now
,But I know that I still need you here
,You say I'm crazy
,Cause you don't think I know what you've done
,But when you call me baby
,I know I'm not the only one
,You've been so unfaithful
,Now sadly I know why
,Your heart is unobtainable
,Even though Lord knows you kept mine
,You say I'm crazy
,Cause you don't think I know what you've done
,But when you call me baby
,I know I'm not the only one
,I have loved you for many years
,Maybe I am just not enough
,You've made me realise my deepest fear
,By lying and tearing us up
,You say I'm crazy
,Cause you don't think I know what you've done
,But when you call me baby
,I know I'm not the only one

,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,They don't write 'em like that anymore.
,They just don't write 'em like that anymore.
,We'd been living together for a million years,
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,But now it feels so strange out of the atmospheres.
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know.
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing so slow.
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,They don't write 'em like that anymore.
,They don't write 'em like that anymore.
,Mmmm, now ?
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,Cause it's so easy to say that she'll forget your past.
,Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
,They don't write 'em like that anymore.
,No, they just don't write 'em like that anymore.
,Oh, they don't write 'em like that anymore.
,They just don't write 'em like that anymore.
,They just don't, no they don't, no no, uh-uh,
,They just don't write 'em like that anymore.

I look in your eyes
And suddenly I can't face
The thought of letting you go
But we don't say a word
Although we have so much to say
That look on your face
You're feeling the same way
Time is not our best friend
And falling in love
Is only a heartbeat away
So please don't say goodnight
（Chorus）
Just one kiss
From your sweet lips darling
This is it and I can't let you go now
Please stay darling
Let me into your life
Please don't say goodnight
Just one kiss
From your sweet lips darling
This is it I can't go on so much longer
Please stay darling
The moment is oh so right
So please don't say goodnight
Right there in this room
Two innocent fools
Are fighting for the right words to say
And falling in love
Is only a heartbeat away
So please don't say goodnight

,American tourists flock to see the village green.
,
,They snap their photographs and say Gawd darn it,
,Isn't it a pretty scene?
,
,And Daisy's married Tom the grocer boy,
,And now he owns a grocery.

,And all the simple people.
,I miss the village green,
,The church, the clock, the steeple.
,I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.
,And I will return there,
,And I'll and Daisy,
,And we'll sip tea, laugh,
,And talk about the village green.
,
,We will laugh and talk about the village green.

,On a hill so white.
,A face that glows in a golden hue
,No one in this world knows what they do
,I take my oath and I make my vow
,For the tender things are upon me now
,In the fragrance sweet of the evening air
,
,I could leave this world quite without a care.
,O rose of my heart, the vision dims
,The time is brief, now the shadow swims,
,A power for you,a real fine hat
,Cause that's for you and that's where that's at.
,Now what I see in the long twilight
,A star falls down on a hill so white.
,O rose of my heart
,O rose of my heart
,O rose of my heart

,I've been losing sleep
,Flowing tired on myself
,Feeling lonley and harm to flee

,I'll be by your side, meet me in the night
,I'll be your right hand man
,I'll be your left hand man too
,
,I came to this world alone
,And I'll be by myself till the end in the world of my own
,Daydreaming the whole day through
,Like the pig in the dirt
,I've been rolling around with you

, Well, this must be LA
, Tired and lonely
, With no real place to stay
, Is this the future and where I'm gonna be?
, Last night it hit me
, When I had this crazy dream
, Of waking up
, In your house
, On a san francisco street
, We tune out all the nasty weather
, And it's all in front of you and me
, You were intriguing
, Just looking at a magazine
, Like when I first saw you
, Back in two thousand and three
, Then you walked over
, Said: ‘you don't have to be alone.’
, I don't have a crystal ball...
, There's no way that I could've known(I'd be) waking up
, In your house
, On a san francisco street

, And it's all in front of you and me

,Out in the shed because the signal is better
,You dial in because we're happy together
,You seem surprised that I would call you at all
,Out on the road while you were still on your own
,It's so strange that anybody thinks there's a reason
,Why you like tuning in to talk and listen
,
,Remember the time I said I'll be yours forever?
,Taking a while to get my head back together
,Switch on the radio and give me a sign
,Melody taught me that it's all in your mind
,It's so strange that anybody thinks there's a reason
,Why you like tuning in to talk and listen
,But when you signal in and the joy that it brings you to gear
,All the voices aloud and the distance it sounds so clear

,Back home where my love lies waiting
,Back home where we are one
,Day dawns and I'm still here
,Too far to reach and to see clear
,Your songs fill my heart
,Your highest peaks and your holy ghats
,Sing blackbird in the dead of night
,Lead the way and give me light
,I know that the sun lies eastward
,I know where my heart belongs
,Back home where my love lies waiting
,Back home where we are one
,How long can I wait for your touch?
,How long can I wait for your love?
,How long can I stay in this place?
,Back home is where I will wait…

,Can't you hear my call?
,Are you coming to get me now?
,I've been waiting for
,You to come rescue me
,I need you to hold
,Live withinside of me
,I'm in here
,Can anybody see me?
,Can anybody help?
,Les passants passant, je passe mon temps à les regarder penser
,Leurs pas pressés dans leurs corps lésés
,Leurs passé se dévoile dans les pas sans se soucier
,
,Que suspicieuse, à l'affût, je perçois le jeu de Pan
,Leur visage comme des masques me fait l'effet répugnant
,Que faire semblant, c'est dans l'air du temps
,
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,
,L'enfant n'est fait que de fêtes
,Le fait est que l'effet se reflète à sa capacité de prendre le fait tel qu'il est
,Sans se référer à un système de pensée dans sa tête
,
,L'automne déjà, c'était l'été hier encore
,Le temps me surprend, semble s'accélérer
,Les chiffres de mon âge m'amènent vers ce mois rêvé
,
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,
,Chaque mois se joue
,Dans des cycles différents, c'est marrant ces remous
,Qui m'animent à travers le temps
,D'un état à un autre, j'oscille inexorablement
,
,Par les temps je cours à l'équilibre
,Chaque jugement sur les gens
,Me donne la direction à suivre
,Sur ces choses en moi à changer, qui m'empêchent d'être libre
,
,Les voix se libèrent et s'exposent
,Dans les vitrines du monde en mouvement
,Les corps qui dansent en osmose
,Glissent, tremblent, se confondent et s'attirent irrésistiblement
,
,Par les temps je cours à l'expression
,Chaque émotion ressentie
,Me donne envie d'exprimer les non-dits
,Et que justice soit faite dans nos pauvres vies endormies
,
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera
,Passe, passe, passera
,La dernière restera

,Back In Town
,by Matt Dusk
,from the album "Back In Town"
,
,It seems just like yesterday when we were standing here
,Yankee's hat upon my head and your voice in my ear
,You talked about the future and all the things we'd do
,I never thought your lovin' words would frighten me from you.
,
,I remember when I sold my car to board that train
,You said you were sure that I would not come back again
,And now you see with your own eyes and start to realize
,I'm not the man I thought I was, so try to sympathize.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz your man is back in town.
,
,I'm sure you've been thinkin' 'bout just where the hell I've been
,Painted your own pictures of the trouble I got in
,There were times I will admit my heart saw better days
,But I'm the type that has to lose to find I had it made.
,
,No use talkin' too much about things we cannot change
,I know you think it's crazy but I'm here to set things straight
,I'm standing here to say that I'll give love a try
,It's my complicated way to say I'll simplify.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz your man is back in town
,Baby it's cool to take your time
,I was a fool, out of my mind
,So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
,'cuz your man is back in town.
,
,I was drawn away, now I'm back to stay
,I was wrong to think, there was a better way
,Now I see with my own eyes, 'bout time I realize
,I hope in time you will forgive, I'll never leave your side.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz you man is back in town
,Baby it's cool to take your time
,I was a fool, out of my mind
,So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
,'cuz your man is back in town

,
,
,
,Holding back the years,
,Thinking of the fear I've had for so long.
,When somebody hears,
,Listen to the fear that's gone.
,Strangled by the wishes of pater,
,Hoping for the arm of mater,
,Get to me sooner or later,
,I'll keep holding on,
,Chance for me to escape from all I know.
,Holding back the tears.
,There's nothing here has grown.
,I've wasted all my tears,
,Wasted all those years.
,Nothing had the chance to be good,
,Nothing ever could, yeah.
,I'll keep holding on.
,So tight.
,
,I find myself in a strange situation, and I don't know how
,What seemed to be an infatuation, is so different now
,I can't get by if we're not together, ooh can't you see
,Girl I want you now and forever, close to me
,I'm longing for the time, I'm longing for the day
,Hoping that you will promise to be mine, and never go away
,I don't want to live without you, I don't want to live without you
,I could never live without you, live without your love
,Ooh
,I ask myself, but there's no explanation for the way I feel
,I know I've reached the right destination, and I know it's real
,I'm longing for the time, I'm longing for the day
,When I'll be giving you this heart of mine, believe me when I say
,I don't want to live without you, I don't want to live without you
,I could never live without you, live without your love
,Now I don't want to live without you, I don't want to live without you
,I could never live without you, live without your love
,I don't want to live without you, live without your love
,(Live without your love) live without your love
,(Live without your love) you see, I'm lost without your love
,(Live without your love) oooh oh
,(Live without your love) without your love...
Heart of mine
 Heart of mine,
 Be still
 You can play with fire,
 But you'll get the bill
 Don't let him know
 Don't let him know that you love him
 Oh, don't be a fool, don't be blind
 Heart of mine
 Heart of mine,
 Go back home
 You've got no reason to wander
 No reason to roam
 Don't let him see
 Don't let him see that you need him
 Oh, don't push yourself over the line
 Heart of mine
 Heart of mine,
 Go back where you been
 The only trouble with you
 Is if you let him in
 Don't let him hear
 Don't let him hear where you're goin'
 Oh, I'm tired of ties that bind
 Heart of mine
 Heart of mine,
 So malicious and so full of guile
 I give you an inch
 And you take a mile
 Don't let yourself fall
 Don't let yourself stumble
 Oh, do the time, don't do the crime
 Heart of mine

Well, it's not far down to paradise, at least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never-never land, no reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Fantasy, it gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie, every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well it's not far back to sanity, at least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away and find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go Go

Go Johnny Go go
Johnny B. Goode
He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go Go
Go Johnny Go----go~
Go Johnny Go Go Go

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And you would be the leader of a big old band.
people goes closed miles around
To listen tu you play to you the sun goes down
will you Maybe  be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.
Go Go
Go Johnny Go

The guitar owned an' played
By the great Booker White
Found its way, by grace into my arms
He would call it “Hard Rock”
'Cos the body's made of steel
On th headstock he glued a heart-shaped charm
In a brown leather case, with green velvet linin'
It thrilled my soul to the core
Stuck on the side with old scotch tape
Was a list of the songs he's famous for
Chorus 1:
Booker's guitar's got a story to tell
Of hard-earned hope an' unshed tears
Booker's guitar rings like a bell
It's gonna keep on ringin' for a thousand years
The late greate Booker White
Sang straight from his heart
Everyone who heard him knows it's true
He'd spank that shiny guitar just like a drum
'Cross the Mississippi Delta, Europe too
Chorus 2:
Booker's guitar's got a story to tell
Of boxcars an' scars, moonshine an' beer
Booker's guitar rings like a bell
It's gonna keep on ringin' for a thousand years
Chorus 3:
Booker's guitar's got a story to tell
A story the world needs to hear
Booker's guitar rings like a bell
It's gonna keep on ringin' for a thousand years

,Come on
,Ooh yeah
,Never be the same again
,I call you up whenever things go wrong
,You're always there
,You are my shoulder to cry on
,I can't believe it took me so long
,To take the forbidden step
,Is this something that I might regret
,(Come on come on)
,Novthing ventured nothing gained
,(You are the one)
,A lonely heart that can't be tamed
,(Come on come on)
,I'm hoping that you feel the same
,This is something that I can't forget
,I thought that we would just be friends
,Things will never be the same again
,It's just the beginning it's not the end
,Things will never be the same again
,It's not a secret anymore
,Now we've opened up the door
,Starting tonight and from now on
,We'll never, never be the same again
,Never be the same again
,Now I know that we were close before
,I'm glad I realised I need you so much more
,And I don't care what every one will say
,It's about you and me
,And we'll never be the same again
,I though that we would just be friends(Oh yeah)
,Things will never be the same again
,It's just the beginnning it's not the end
,(We've only just begun)
,Things will never be the same again
,It's not a secret anymore
,Now we've opened up the door(Opened up the door)
,Starting tonight and from now on
,We'll never never be the same again
,Never be the same again
,Nite and day
,Black beach sand to red clay
,The US to UK
,NYC to LA
,From sidewalks to highways
,See it'll never be the same
,What I'm sayin' my mind frame never changed til you
,came and rearranged
,But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
,To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden
,When there's no comptetiton
,And you render my condition
,Though improbable it's not impossible
,For a love that could be unstoppable
,But wait
,A fine line's between fate and destiny
,Do you belive in the things that were just meant to be?
,When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
,Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly and
,As our energies mix and begin to mulitply
,Everyday situations
,They start to simplfy
,So things will never be the same between you and I
,We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified
,I thought that we would just be friends
,Things will never be the same again
,It's just the beginning it's not the end
,Things will never be the same again
,It's not a secret anymore
,Now we've opened up the door
,Starting tonight and from now on
,We'll never never be the same again(Come on come on)
,Things will never be the same again
,(You are the one)
,Never be the same again....(repeat)
,It's not a secret anymore
,Never be the same again....(repeat)
,It's not a secret anymore

,Подойду к тебе поближе,
,Зов души твоей услышу.
,Посмотрю в глаза твои и скажу.
,Позови, за собой меня ты позови.
,Даже если на край земли,
,Прилечу, ты только позови.
,Словно тень, словно тень я за тобой пойду,
,А свеча любви моей
,Не погаснет, пока дышу.
,Чувствую твое дыханье
,Сквозь большое расстоянье,
,В ожидании проходят годы мои.
,А любовь моя, как пытка,
,Пронзила сердце стрелою пылкой.
,Нам не склеить нашу чашу любви.
,Позови, за собой меня ты позови.

,Прилечу, ты только позови.

,Давай придумаем мир по-другому:
,Где мы с тобой давно не знакомы;
,Где я встретил тебя ещё ребенком,
,Где наши поцелуи были приколом.
,А ты всё ближе и ближе ко мне -
,На расстоянии двух сердец;
,И эти ночи между строчек...
,Я напишу, о чём ты хочешь.
,Ты стала смыслом моей жизни.
,Ни далеко, ни близко; ни высоко, ни низко;
,Над пропастью риска я лечу, и знаю -
,Ты будешь со мной до конца моей жизни.
,В твоих руках теряюсь я.
,Без тебя - ни ночи и дня.
,Твоя страсть жарче пламени огня.
,Тихо маня, зовёшь меня.
,Ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.

,Я больше, чем твой. Ты больше, чем моя.
,Дикая любовь, - и это навсегда.
,Я буду вечно твой, а ты будешь моя.
,Связаны судьбой, - и это навсегда!
,С тобою мир меняется совсем -
,И нету роли, и нету сцен.
,Но только ты способна убивать,
,И только ты заставляешь дышать.
,Я тебе ревность, а ты мне шрамы.
,Ты просто стерва, а я упрямый.
,И по всем жанрам этой драмы -
,Нам с тобой далеко до идеала.
,Алый закат, смятая постель.
,Я - твой вулкан; ты - моя метель.
,И наша страсть будет гореть,
,Пока есть крылья - можем лететь.
,В твоих глазах целый океан.
,Ты - мой свет, я - твой туман.
,И среди всех моих изъян -
,Я за тебя всё отдам.
,Ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.
,Но только ты, ты - причина моей улыбки.

,And as the night danced by,
,a kiss became a sigh.
,Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does,
,no heart ever yearned the way mine does,
,for you.
,And yet I know too well.
,Some day you'll say goodbye.
,Then violins will cry and so will I, mam'selle.

,Why do birds suddenly appear
,Every time you are near
,Just like me they long to be
,Close to you
,Why do stars fall down from the sky
,Every time you walk by
,Just like me they long to be
,Close to you
,On the day that you were born
,And the angels got to gether
,And decided to create a dream come true
,So they sprinkled moon dust
,In your hair of gold
,And starlight in your eyes of blue
,That is why all the girls in town
,Follow you all around
,Just like me they long to be
,Close to you

,
,See the stone set in your eyes
,See the thorn twist in your side
,I wait for you
,Sleight of hand and twist of fate
,On a bed of nails she makes me wait
,And I wait without you
,With or without you
,Through the storm we reach the shore
,You give it all but I want more
,And I'm waiting for you
,I can't live
,My hands are tied
,My body bruised, she's got me with
,Nothing to win and
,Nothing left to lose
,And you give yourself away
,With or without you my love
,So I can't live without you baby my love
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend I am kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling, I'll be true 

First I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to hurt me with goodbye
You think I'd crumble
You think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I
I will survive
As long as i know how to love
I know I will stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me

(Chorus)
,
,I can't sleep at night,
,though I try and I try
,I just toss and turn
,and long and yearn
,And when I do dream it's
,only you and
,all the lovely things you used to do
,And even though now I
,know we're through
,I know that it's selfish, baby
,But I just cannot help it, baby
,I, I wanna be the one
,to make you happy, yeah
,I get rid of all of my pride
,to be the one at your side
,every morning and kiss you every night
,Make you happy, make you happy
,We used to laugh and cry
,Like the hours just roll long by
,Was there another girl?
,Baby what in the whole wide world
,would make you think that
,you are less than my-my everything
,I know that it's selfish, baby
,But I just cannot help it, baby
,I, I wanna be the one
,to make you happy, yeah
,I get rid of all of my pride
,to be the one at your side
,every morning and kiss you every night
,Make you happy, make you happy
,I know we have forever,
,and that we'd always be together
,Come good or come bad whether
,I know that it's selfish, baby
,But I just cannot help it, baby
,I, I wanna be the one
,to make you happy, yeah
,I get rid of all of my pride
,to be the one at your side
,every morning and kiss you every night
,Make you happy, make you happy
,Ma-ke you happy
,Make you happy, yeah
,Mmmmm

Chapter five
(Bigroom Blitz)
International bitch!
It's, it's, the bigroom blitz!
Turn it up !

Shotta got the plan, man
Always like a Grand Slam
Big shot, hole in one
Shotalot is on the run
Crack on the whip, snap attack
Bars so tight, front to back
I reach my fate at the gates
God says shotta you was great

When I’m shopping
And my bag filled with options so don’t ask
What it cost I’m in a Maserati
Coupe going so fast
That I lost ‘em
And my bitch got so much swag
That these bad bitches on us
Ah! Killing y’all, pow!

(Bigroom Blitz)
It's, it's, the bigroom blitz

Bring the noise !

I jack them hoes, direct them hoes
Take ‘em home and let them hoes
Go live out their fantasies
They’re popping pills, I’m rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas

Shotta got the slo-mo
You can call it pro flow
Every shot a straight flush
Shotalot is in a rush
Back on the floor, lyrical madness
On the mic, Jack the cactus
I reach my fate at the gates
God says shotta, you was great!

Shotta gotta the chicks
It's, it's, the bigroom blitz

Yee-haa !

,You've got me changing all I ever thought
,When you first got so mad lost your rag
,Trying to some save some trees
,Angry cries, saw your thighs
,And I fell to my knees

,When we drank too much beer
,Lost our fear
,Our defenses were down
,You got up tried your luck
,Bought a dubious round
,It can be hard to resist
,It's a moment of madness

,A trailer of sin
,A smiling assassin
,The demon within
,Endorphins are raging
,Resistance is thin
,And you're blowing my mind
,Cause I find that your theories of life
,Are insane, feed my brain
,I could listen all night
,I can't leave till we kiss
,And I just wanna stare at your hair
,And imagine you opening your door
,In your drawer there's some leather in there
,I refuse, you persist
,You know I'm not asking a lot,
,Only your life,
,I don't want to get what I want,
,But I'm willing to try,
,And I'm gonna ask you to stop,
,But I'm full of lies

,Pop, six, squish, uh-uh
,Cicero, Lipschitz
,
,He had it coming
,He had it coming
,He only had himself to blame

,Cicero, Lipschitz
,
,You know how people
,have these little habits
,That get you down. Like Bernie.
,Bernie like to chew gum.
,No, not chew. POP.
,So I came home this one day
,And I am really irritated, and I'm
,looking for a bit of sympathy
,and there's Bernie layin'
,on the couch, drinkin' a beer
,and chewin'. No, not chewin'.
,Poppin'. So, I said to him,
,I said, "you pop that
,gum one more time..."
,and he did.
,So I took the shotgun off the wall
,and I fired two warning shots...
,...into his head.
,

,
,I met Ezekiel Young from
,Salt Lake city about two years ago
,and he told me he was single
,and we hit it off right away.
,So, we started living together.
,He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd
,fix him a drink, We'd have dinner.
,And then I found out,
,"Single" he told me?
,Single, my ass. Not only
,was he married
,...oh, no, he had six wives.
,One of those Mormons, you know. So that
,night, when he came home, I fixed him
,his drink as usual.
,You know, some guys just can't hold
,their arsenic.
,
,Hah! He had it coming
,He had it coming
,He took a flower
,In its prime
,And then he used it
,And he abused it
,It was a murder
,But not a crime!
,
,Pop, six, squish, uh-uh
,Cicero, Lipschitz
,
,Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
,carvin' up the chicken for dinner,
,minding my own business,
,and in storms my husband Wilbur,
,in a jealous rage.
,"You been screwin' the milkman,"
,he says. He was crazy
,and he kept screamin',
,"you been screwin the milkman."
,And then he ran into my knife.
,He ran into my knife ten times.."
,
,If you'd have been there
,If you'd have seen it
,I betcha you would have done the same!
,
,Mit keresek, én itt? Azt mondják,
,hogy a híres lakem lefogta a férjemet én meg
,lecsaptam a fejét. De nem igaz, én ártatlan
,vagyok. Nem tudom miért mondja
,Uncle Sam, hogy én tettem. Probáltam
,a rendõrségen megmagyarázni de nem értették meg...
,
,Yeah, but did you do it?
,
,UH UH, not guilty!
,
,My sister, Veronica and
,I had this double act
,and my husband, Charlie,
,traveled around with us.
,Now, for the last number in
,our act, we did 20 acrobatic tricks
,one two three four,five...splits, spread eagles,
,back flips,flip flops,
,one right after the other.
,Well, this one night we were in the hotel Cicero,
,the three of us,
,boozin' and
,havin' a few laughs
,when we run out of ice.
,So I went out to get some.
,I come back, open the door
,and there's Veronica and
,Charlie doing Number Seventeen-
,the spread eagle.
,
,Well, I was in such a state of shock,
,I completely blacked out.I can't remember a thing.
,It wasn't until later,
,when I was washing the blood off my hands
,I even knew they were dead.
,
,They had it coming
,They had it coming
,They had it coming all along
,I didn't do it
,But if I'd done it
,How could you tell me that I was wrong?
,
,They had it coming

,
,I loved Alvin Lipschitz
,more than I can possibly say.
,He was a real artistic guy...
,sensitive... a painter.
,But
,He was always trying
,to find himself.
,He'd go out every night
,looking for himself
,and on the way
,he found Ruth,
,Gladys,
,Rosemary and Irving.
,I guess you can say we broke
,up because of artistic differences.
,He saw himself as alive
,and I saw him dead.

,Want to let it flow
,Free like the water in the river bank
,All I want is to let go
,It appears so simple though when I look at it now
,All I have to do is to give it a try

,Hello.
,Is there anybody in there?
,Just nod if you can hear me.
,Is there anyone home?
,Come on, now.
,I hear you're feeling down.
,Well I can ease your pain,
,Get you on your feet again.
,Relax.
,I need some information first.
,Just the basic facts:
,Can you show me where it hurts?
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I had a fever.
,My hands felt just like two balloons.
,Now I got that feeling once again.
,I can't explain, you would not understand.
,This is not how I am.
,I have become comfortably numb.
,Ok.
,Just a little pinprick. <ping>
,There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
,But you may feel a little sick.
,Can you stand up?
,I do believe it's working. Good.
,That'll keep you going for the show.
,Come on it's time to go.
,There is no pain, you are receding.
,A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
,You are only coming through in waves.
,Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
,When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
,Out of the corner of my eye.
,I turned to look but it was gone.
,I cannot put my finger on it now.
,The child is grown, the dream is gone.
,I have become comfortably numb.

,We certainly are under spoken and understanding
,But there's a lot of things unsaid as well
,We shout and argue and fight, and work it on out
,We bitch and we fight
,Diss each other on sight
,But this thing we do
,These times together
,Rain or shine or stormy weather
,This thing we do
,With world-weary grace
,We've taken our places
,We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
,Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire
,Stoking the flame
,But we're here for the ride
,It's louder than words
,This thing that we do
,Louder than words
,The way it unfurls
,It's louder than words
,The sum of our parts
,The beat of our hearts
,Is louder than words
,Louder than words
,The strings bend and slide
,As the hours glide by
,An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
,Gonna tap out the rhythm
,Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
,We're more than alive
,It's louder than words

,I was spending my time in the duldrums
,I was caught in a couldron of hate
,I felt persecuted and paralysed
,I thought that everything else would just wait
,While you are wasting your time on your enemies
,Engulfed in a fever of spite
,Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
,Like shadows into the night
,To martyr yourself to caution
,Is not going to help at all
,Because there'll be no safety in numbers
,When the right one walks out of the door
,
,Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
,Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
,Stuck in a world of isolation
,While the ivy grows over the door
,So I open my door to my enemies
,And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
,but they tell me to please go fuck myself
,You know you just can't win

,Spilling drinks on my settee
,(Do I wanna know?)
,If this feeling flows both ways

,Simmer down and pucker up
,I'm sorry to interrupt it's just

,And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
,She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
,And when she needs to shelter from reality
,She takes a dip in my daydreams
,My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
,That little lady sitting on the passenger side
,It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
,The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
,As Arabella, oh
,As Arabella
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
,You can't be sure
,Arabella's got a '70s head

,And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place
,(That's magic) in a cheetah print coat

,(Organic) cigarettes that she smokes
,(Rubs her lips) 'round a Mexican Coke
,(Makes you wish) that you were the bottle
,(Takes a sip) of your soul, and it sounds like
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul

,Never knowing when to stop
,Sunglasses indoor, par for the course
,Lights in the floor and sweat on the walls
,Cages and poles
,Call of the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
,She's having a sly indoor smoke
,And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
,Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
,As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
,And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
,That you just swallowed have got you going

,She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't

,And you look like you could

,Are you mine?
,Are you mine?
,Are you mine?
,I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
,Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
,Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
,Great escape lost track of time and space
,She's a silver lining climbing on my desire
,And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
,And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
,And I can't help myself,
,All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
,Are you mine?

, 作词 : Marx, Vandross
,Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence
,My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
,Spin me around ‘til I fell asleep
,Then up the stairs he would carry me
,And I knew for sure I was loved
,
,If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
,I’d play a song that would never, ever end
,How I’d love, love, love
,To dance with my father again
,When I and my mother would disagree
,To get my way, I would run from her to him
,He’d make me laugh just to comfort me
,Then finally make me do just what my mama said
,Later that night when I was asleep
,He left a dollar under my sheet
,Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
,If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him
,I’d play a song that would never, ever end
,‘Cause I’d love, love, love
,To dance with my father again
,Sometimes I’d listen outside her door
,And I’d hear how my mother cried for him
,I pray for her even more than me
,I pray for her even more than me
,I know I’m praying for much too much
,But could you send back the only man she loved
,I know you don’t do it usually
,But dear Lord she’s dying
,To dance with my father again
,Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
,She got me goin' crazy
,Thinkin' about the things we used to be
,All the things she meant to me
,How she said she'd never leave
,Don't know how it happened
,But it seemed like it was yesterday
,When everything I did made you smile
,And now I don't know left from right
,You turned my whole world upside down
,So won't you come save me now?
,So won't you come save me?
,It's like an earthquake
,Shaking up the way I loved you
,Wanna come to your rescue
,But I'm no longer loved
,I said I'm no longer loved
,It's like an earthquake
,Shaking up the way I loved you
,Wanna come to your rescue
,But I'm no longer loved
,I said I'm no longer loved
,I wish I could question why
,To the days when you were mine, yeah
,I'd throw back the hands of time
,And everything would just be fine, yeah
,But everything's so messed up now
,How'd it get so complicated?
,
,We were like a work of art
,But girl somehow it faded
,And now I don't know left from right
,You turned my world upside down
,So won't you come save me now

Funny when you stop and think
Time goes faster than you blink
Nothing's ever like it was
but girl we've got a special thing
all the happiness it brings
is more than enough

I know it's hard to believe
You're still the biggest part of me
all I'm living for
I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you
and need you by my side
I'm still mad about you
all I ever wanted was you
your still the one ,

It's hard to breathe when were apart
You're like sunshine in my heart
I keep you here inside
you've been everything to me
you've been and always will be
the apple of my eye

And I know it's hard to believe
You're still the biggest part of me
all I'm living for
I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you
and need you by my side
I'm still mad about you
all i ever wanted was you
your still the one ,

If you love me
look into my eyes and say you do
I've been waiting all my life
for someone just like you
baby all that we've been through
Girl I'm still in love with you
and I want you to know I do, I do

I still think about you
I still dream about you
I still want you
and need you by my side
I'm still mad about you
all I ever wanted was you
your still the one ,

,You own shut my whole world I acted like your mama
,Made excuses for your behavior
,You made a mistake I can't do like I save you
,I almost fell into engagement
,But I came to my senses they don't need for replacement
,I always trusted you
,Now I am over
,I let you run my life
,Now I'm the only
,Now You never love me right
,Now I am stronger
,You can come back no more
,Cause I'm a lover
,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
,I cannot say I put my foot down very often
,I cannot say I knew enough was enough
,Then I was your tail and I wagged like you wanted to
,I was your puppy and I did what you wanna do
,Kept it within like a mortal flow
,My love had me going like death on the row
,Keep it low keep it coming was the way I went by
,You dropped bombs another day goes by
,But somehow I kinda came to my grips
,Saw the shadow of the king
,Heard the truth on the myths
,I looked myself in the mirror and I saw you
,I told myself is this really what you wanna do
,I can't lie I better of as now no more
,Then me myself on my mind any how
,You thought me never to bow
,Among all things that you didn't allow
,I always trusted you
,Now I am over
,I let you run my life
,Now I'm the only
,Now You never love me right
,Now I am stronger
,You can come back no more
,Cause I'm a lover

,Diggin'
,菅野よう子
,You know my daddy dug gates for his whole life
,And he never knew nothing more
,Yeah and his daddy done the dig like his old man
,Who had dug before the war
,And though she couldn't have known till I was born
,My poor mama God rest her soul
,Like them I come out diggin'
,
,Well I was layin' out wire on number 9
,Now when she come down to earth
,And she was talkin' real loud
,All about how she was gonna save the universe
,I went and snuck a lil' peek in her blue eyes
,And words just aren't enough
,She had me off and runnin'
,
,Could it be that I got bored and lonely
,Could it be that I'm just dumb and horny
,Could it be that Lady Luck has smiled herself on me
,
,She wore rattlesnake boots,a sassy mood
,She had me laughin' in my tears
,The most beautiful thing,so young and sweet
,A little green behind the ears
,She took me higher then I ever been
,Lordy what have I been missin'?
,Now she is all I'm diggin'
,
,Could it be that I got bored and lonely
,Could it be that I'm just dumb and horny
,Could it be that Lady Luck has smiled herself on me
,
,She's smilin' down on me,yeah
,
,Come a little closer
,Let me show you how it could be
,Spacy little cowgirl
,Spacy little cowgirl
,Come a little closer to me
,
,
,Happiness is just a word to me
,And it might have meant a thing or two
,If I'd known the difference
,Emptiness, a lonely parody
,And my life, another smokin' gun
,A sign of my indifference
,Always keepin' safe inside
,Where no one ever had a chance
,To penetrate a break in
,Let me tell you some have tried
,But I would slam the door so tight
,That they could never get in
,Kept my cool under lock and key
,And I never shed a tear
,Another sign of my condidtion
,Fear of love or bitter vanity
,That kept me on the run
,The main events at my confession
,I kept a chain upon my door
,That would shake the shame of Cain
,Into a blind submission
,The burning ghost without a name
,Was calling all the same
,But I wouldn't listen
,The longer I'd stall
,The further I'd crawl
,The further I'd crawl
,The harder I'd fall
,I was crawlin' into the fire
,The more that I saw
,The further I'd fall
,The further I'd fall
,The lower I'd crawl
,I kept fallin' into the fire
,Into the fire
,Into the fire
,Suddenly it occurred to me
,The reason for the run and hide
,Had totaled my existnce
,Everything left on the other side
,Could never be much worse that this
,But could I go the distance
,I faced the door and all my shame
,Tearin' off each piece of chain
,Until they all were broken
,But no matter how I tried
,The other side was licked so tight
,That door it wouldn't open
,Gave it all that I got
,And started to knock
,Shouted for someone
,To open the lock
,I just gotta get through the door
,And the more that I knocked
,The hotter I got
,The hotter I got
,The harder I'd knock
,I just gotta break through the door
,Gotta knock a little harder
,Gotta knock a little harder
,Gotta knock a little harder
,Break through the door
I don't feel a thing
and I stopped remembering
The days are just like moments turned to hours
 
Mother used to say
if you want, you'll find a way
Bet mother never danced through fire shower
 
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Is it right or is it wrong
and is it here that I belong
 
I don't hear a sound
Silent faces in the ground
The quiet screams, but I refused to listen
 
If there is a hell
I 'm sure this is how it smells
Wish this were a dream, but no, it isn't
 
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Am I right or am I wrong
and is it here that I belong
 
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Why do I feel so alone
For some reason I think of home

,Many night we've prayed
,With no proof anyone could hear
,In our heart a hopeful song
,We barely understood
,Now we are not afraid
,Although we know there's much to fear
,we were moving the mountain long
,Before we knew we could
,There can be miracles
,When you believe
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who knows what miracles
,You can achieve
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,And this time of fear
,When prayer so often proves in vain
,Hope seems like the summer birds
,Too swiftly flown away
,Yet now I'm standing here
,My heart's so full I can't explain
,Seeking faith and speaking words
,Never thought I'd say
,There can be miracles
,When you believe
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who knows what miracles
,You can achieve
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,They don't always happen when you ask
,And it's easy to give in to your fear
,But when you're blinded by your pain
,Can't see you way safe through the rain
,A small but still, resilient voice
,Says love is very near
,There can be miracles
,When you believe
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who knows what miracles
,You can achieve
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,Just believe
,Ohhhhh ouhhhhhhhhh ohhhhhhhh
,Un mal de toi c'est un vif qui m'écorche
,Arrachant le pétale de ma fleur de peau
,Même si je plis sous les coups qu'tu décoches
,Sous la violence de tes moindres mots
,Ne me demande pas de devenir ton ami
,Aprés avoir rêver d'amour j'n'ai plus envie
,Si tu as tant besoin de ta liberté
,Laisse-moi la fierté de me mentir et de prier
,Entre toi et moi
,Je sentais que ça n'marcherait pas
,Cette histoire où ....
,Entre toi et moi
,Je connaissais la fin dès le début
,Mais je me mens
,As-tu conscience de tout c'que tu déclanches ?
,Quand je te parle tu me tournes le dos
,J't'ap...... j't'appelle, j't'appelle
,Je t'en prie décroche
,Je n'fais que survivre, mon sourire est faux
,Je donne le meilleur pour pouvoir me mentir
,Car t'aimer sans rien recevoir serait pire
,Si tu as tant besoin de ta liberté
,Laisse-moi la fierté
,De me mentir et de prier
,Entre toi et moi
,Je sentais que ça n'marcherait pas
,Cette histoire où ....
,Entre toi et moi
,Je connaissais la fin dès le début
,Mais je me mens
,J'ai ma fierté
,Je dois me mentir
,Dieu me préserve car
,J'aime tout de toi
,Tant de secrets
,De nourrir mes rêves
,Et me mentir
,J'en ai marre, je suis fou de toi
,C'est entre toi et moi
,Entre toi et moi
,Je sentais que ça n'marcherait pas
,Cette histoire où ....
,Entre toi et moi
,Je connaissais la fin, dès le début
,Mais je me mens （ je me mens ）
,Mais je me mens
,Entre toi et moi....

,I will not make the same mistakes that you did
,I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
,I will not break the way you did
,You fell so hard
,I learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I find it hard to trust
,Not only me, but everyone around me
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,I lose my way
,And it's not too long before you point it out
,I cannot cry
,Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
,I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
,Every day of my life
,My heart can't possibly break
,When it wasn't even whole to start with
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I find it hard to trust
,Not only me, but everyone around me
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,I watched you die
,I heard you cry
,Every night in your sleep
,I was so young
,You should have known better than to lean on me
,You never thought of anyone else
,You just saw your pain
,And now I cry
,In the middle of the night
,for the same damn thing
,Because of you
,I never stray too far from the sidewalk
,Because of you
,I learned to play on the safe side
,So I don't get hurt
,Because of you
,I tried my hardest just to forget everything
,Because of you
,I don't know how to let anyone else in
,Because of you
,I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
,Because of you
,I am afraid
,Because of you
,Aren't you somethin' to admire
,Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
,And I can't help but notice
,You reflect in this heart of mine
,
,If you ever feel alone and
,The glare makes me hard to find
,Just know that I'm always
,Parallel on the other side
,
,Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
,I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
,Just put your hand on the past
,I'm here tryin' to pull you through
,You just gotta be strong
,Cause I don't wanna lose you now
,I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
,The biggest scene is set in my heart
,There's a space, but now you're home
,
,Show me how to fight for now
,And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
,Comin' back into you once I figured it out
,You were right here all along
,
,It's like you're my mirror
,My mirror staring back at me
,I couldn't get any bigger
,With anyone else beside me
,And now it's clear as this promise
,That we're making
,Two reflections into one
,Cause it's like you're my mirror
,My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
,Aren't you somethin', an original
,Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
,and i can't help but stare cause
,I see truth somewhere in your eyes
,
,I can't ever change without you
,You reflect me, I love that about you
,And if I could, I
,Would look at us all the time
,
,Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
,I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

,
,Now you’re the inspiration for this precious song
,And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
,So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
,And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
,Just to let you know, you are
,
,Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
,My reflection, in everything I do
,You're my reflection and all I see is you
,My reflection, in everything I do
,No Mountains too high, for you to climb
,All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
,No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
,All you have to do is believe it when you pray
,And then you will see, the morning will come
,And everyday will be bright as the sun
,All of your fears cast them on me
,I just want you to see...
,I'll be your cloud up in the sky
,I'll be your shoulder when you cry
,I'll hear your voices when you call me
,I am your angel
,And when all hope is gone, I'm here
,No matter how far you are, I'm near
,It makes no difference who you are
,I am your angel
,I'm your angel
,I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
,All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
,You have everything and you're still lonely
,It doesn't have to be this way, let me show you a better day
,And then you will see, the morning will come
,And all of your days will be bright as the sun
,So all of your fears, just cast them on me
,How can I make you see...
,I'll be your cloud up in the sky
,I'll be your shoulder when you cry
,I'll hear your voices when you call me
,I am your angel
,And when all hope is gone, I'm here
,No matter how far you are, I'm near
,It makes no difference who you are
,I am your angel
,I'm your angel
,And when it's time to face the storm
,I'll be right by your side
,Grace will keep up safe and warm
,And I know we will survive
,And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
,Don't you dare give up the fight
,Just put your trust beyond the sky...
,I'll be your cloud up in the sky
,I'll be your shoulder when you cry
,I'll hear your voices when you call me
,I am your angel
,And when all hope is gone, I'm here
,No matter how far you are, I'm near
,It makes no difference who you are
,I am your angel

Like the legend of the phoenix 
就像那浴火凤凰 
All ends with beginnings 
万物的终端却又新生 
What keeps the planet spinning 
是什么让这星球持续转动 
The force of the beginning

We've come too far

The present has no rhythm
就像没绑着缎带的礼物 
Your gift keeps on giving 
你就像给不完的大放送 
What is this I'm feeling? 
这究竟是怎样的感觉？ 
If you wanna leave I'm with it  
如果你想离开，我想随着你去 
We've come too far 
我们走的太远
to give up who we are

,from nights we don't remember
,do you miss me like i miss you?
,fucked around and got attached to you
,friends can break your heart too, and
,i'm always tired but never of you
,if i pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
,i put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
,i type a text but then i never mind that shit
,i got these feelings but you never mind that shit
,oh oh, keep it on the low
,you're still in love with me but your friends don't know
,if you wanted me you would just say so
,and if i were you, i would never let me go
,i don't mean no harm
,i just miss you on my arm
,wedding bells were just alarms
,caution tape around my heart
,you ever wonder what we coulda been?
,you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
,sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
,i know that i control my thoughts, and i should stop reminiscing
,but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,when love and trust are gone
,i guess this is moving on
,everyone i do right does me wrong
,so every lonely night, i sing this song
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put
,nobody else above you
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i want you
,you want her, you need her
,and i'll never be her
,all alone i watch you watch her
,like she‘s the only girl you've ever seen
,you don't care u never did
,you don't give a damn about me
,yeah all alone i watch you watch her
,she's the only thing you've ever seen
,how is it you never notice
,that you are slowly killing me
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put
,nobody else above you
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i want you
,you want her, you need her
,and i’ll never be her

, Let me tell you the reasons why
, Think you’re one of a kind.
, Here’s to you
, The one that always pulls us through
, Always do what you got to do
, You’re one of a kind
, Thank god your mine.
, You’re an angel dressed in armor
, You’re the fair in every fight
, You’re my life and my safe harbor
, Where the sun sets every night
, And if my love is blind
, I don’t want to see the light.
, It’s your beauty that betrays you
, Your smile gives you away.
, Cause you’re made of strength and mercy
, And my soul is yours to save
, And when this much is true
, When my world was dark and blue
, I know the only one who rescued me was you
, (Chorus)
, Close your eyes
, Let me tell you all the reasons why
, You’re never going to have to cry
, Because you’re one of a kind
, Yeah here’s to you
, The one that always poses true
, You always do what you got to do babe
, Because you’re one of a kind.
, When your luck was down in me
, I know I’m finally free
, So I tell you gratefully
, Yes you’ll be in my heart
, Is yours to keep
, (Chorus)

, You’re the reason that I’m feeling
, It’s finally safe to stay!

,I stop keeping track
,Talk myself in
,I talk myself out

,And the other half's luck
,Wherever you are

,You come out of nowhere and into my life
,And I know that we can be so amazing
,And baby your love is gonna change me

,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen

A chair is still a chair
Even though there's no-one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no-one there to hold you tight 
And no-one there you can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even though there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your voice appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears
Darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs
And turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs
And turn the key
Oh, please be there
Still in love with me

 It serves me right to suffer
 It serves me right to be alone
 It serves me right to suffer
 It serves me right to be alone
 
 You see I'm living in the memory
 Of a day that has passed and gone
 
 Everytime i see a woman
 You know it makes me think about mine
 Everytime i see a woman
 You know it makes me think about mine
 
 You see I'm living in the memory
 Of a woman I've left behind
 
 It serves me right to suffer
 It serves me right to be alone

,I can't think
,I can't walk
,I can't see
,I can't believe
,That I am the last soul on earth
,For what it's worth
,The dreamers dream on
,And I play along
,I am the last soul on earth
,I remember being all yours
,And now you closed all our doors
,Can't forgive you for taking
,Such a big piece of me with you

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
 
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
 
I see a stream down your face
when you lose something you cannot replace
I see a stream down your face
And I
I see a stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from all my mistakes
I see a stream down your face
And I
 
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
,You may say you're walking all by yourself
,Have no one else
,Your life is deadly like a loaded gun
,And you're shaking, love
,Don't shiver, don't give up
,Don't quiver, you're enough
,You will be just fine
,Tonight
,Baby when it's cold outside
,I will keep you warm
,Save you from the storm
,I will light a fire
,And the embers bright
,Will guide you through the night
,When it's cold outside
,I will light a fire (fire)
,I will light a fire (fire)
,I will light a fire (fire)
,When it's cold outside
,I will light a fire
,Keep your bright eyes looking
,Up to the sky now
,Cheer up, be proud
,Walk strong like a soldier
,Onto the battleground
,Breath in, breath out
,Don't shiver, don't give up
,Don't quiver, you're enough
,You will be just fine
,Tonight
,Baby when it's cold outside

,You've been at the bottom
,Only surviving
,You decide who you are now

,I feel like I'm standing on a mountain
,Where everyone can see me
,In the worst way
,All of these eyes on me expecting
,But I can't find a thing to say
,Headlights casting my shadow
,On the clouds behind me
,The darkening all that define me
,And all of that blinding confusion
,How did I ever find you
,In a life of second guessing
,I knew that first glance
,I would let you in
,And the emotion of the moment
,I gave myself to chance
,Thought of where'd we go not of what I been
,Headlights I'm weak and I'm hollow
,With the weight of my own head
,Too heavy on my bones
,Headlight I'm eager to follow
,So many things unsaid
,And so much still unknown
,Headlights clearing this shadow
,I'm free for you to define me
,Nothing else in my vision
,How did I ever lose you
,I was living such a vacant life
,And then I thought that I had it right this time
,As fast as a fool can fall
,I'm trapped back in these same four walls
,I was living such a lonely life
,And then I thought that it all come right this time
,Drive back in these same four walls
,Headlights
,Casting my shadow
,The dark in all that define me
,In all that blind and confusion
,Clearing the shadow
,Trapped back in these same four walls
,Then I thought that it all come right this time
,
,
,
,
,
,
,I wake up to another day
,I don't know if I can face
,All the fears, that is tearing me down
,Yea, I'm trying to be brave
,But I'm afraid, about to fade
,I wanna stand but I don't know how
,I look up and all I see is Your love holding me
,When I feel like giving up
,When my heart is hurt too much
,Feels like I've reached the end
,No, I won't turn and run
,This battle will be won
,When I've done all I can
,I stand stand stand
,Some days I lose my place
,It's a fight to keep my faith
,But You are with me, I am not alone, no
,But all around my work is late
,Toss like an ocean wave
,You are my rock and the storm clouds blow
,On Your promise, I will stand
,Oh look the ground is sinking sand
,Sinking sand
,oh who woooh
,It's sinking sinking
,yea ye
,yea yea
,So I'll stand stand stand
,I stand stand
,I'll stand stand stand
,
,
,
,
,
,Guess my suspicions all on you were right
,You brought the hurricane into my life
,Here's the truth, I wanna know how it feels on your own
,Just blurry images of us in mind
,I used to cry, I used to worry
,But now you say you're so damn sorry
,How could you be kind but still so cruel
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,You've got my heart under a headlight
,And though my mind is always changing
,Won't you give my heart a break
,Try to fix the broken pieces once again
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,To give your heart away
,Nothing could feel the same between us two
,You seem to want me now I don't want you
,I used to fall in the trap, hard to find my way back
,And now you hate it that I wear the shoes
,I used to cry, I used to worry
,But now you say you're so damn sorry
,How could you pretend to be so real
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,You got my heart under a headlight
,And though my mind is always changing
,Won't you give my heart a break
,Try to fix the broken pieces once again
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,To give your heart away
,Just close your eyes
,Hide away from the monster in disguise
,Now you've learnt to love
,There ain't nothing I'm afraid of, now
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,You got my heart under a headlight
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,You got my heart under a headlight (my heart is going under)
,And though my mind is always changing
,Won't you give my heart a break
,Try to fix the broken pieces once again
,Don't say that this is what it feels like
,To give your heart away

,Wherever the rain goes
,Leaves gasoline rainbows
,On the water it looks beautiful
,But tragic when the waves have parted
,If we disappear
,Who gets the souvenir
,Or sees the outline of the trees that won't be there
,Once the machines have started
,I don't wanna wait
,Oh I don't wanna sit and hope
,I don't wanna tell you
,Don't wanna tell you
,Tell you I told you so
,So prove me wrong
,And don't just let it go
,Don't wanna watch
,So I can tell you tell you I told you so
,Tell you I told you so
,It was chemical
,Oh it was magical
,And when it hits the light it pleased the eye
,Who knew it could be so fatal
,Yesterday oh is miles and miles away
,We took a picture to remind us that today we are caught in the middle
,Oh don't wanna wait
,Oh don't wanna sit and hope
,I don't wanna tell you

,Все уходят со своими дальше
,Притуши и иди ко мне
,Я развёл огонь в унисон твоих танцев
,С неба падает, я не ликую
,Не думаю который час, я ловлю его
,Время остановилось возле нас
,А ты держишься, как я в ебучем туре — внаглую
,Я веду к тому, чтобы свести потери к минимуму
,Выжимаю максимум
,Я иду к тому, чтобы гнуть свою линию
,И сказать, что все вы — так себе
,Не хуже и не лучше, просто так себе
,Как бывшие суки и вчерашние пацы
,Что всякий раз мне кричали: ?Да завязывай!?
,Быть на связи? Да не-е-е-е-е
,
,Мы поднимаем бокалы вверх и видим свет
,Бросаем чемоданы с прошлым, сожалений нет
,Понятно, сколько ей, тут всё возможно, всё возможно
,Хотя бы на одной из девяти планет
,Оставить след, ведь где твоя любовь
,Когда твой взгляд — мешок побогаче
,

,Пацан, я всего лишь хотел, чтобы ты работал
,То как я живу — это моё дело, то как ты живёшь — пока лишь планы
,Видел твоего братуху — и он нулевой
,И кто из нас упал на стакан снова?
,Если хотел бы, то давно работал
,Но веки не поднять, сообщения в Telegram
,Твой день весит эти 5 грамм
,Дальше ты всё сам знаешь
,Мне не надо улыбаться
,Я тебе не малолетка на дешёвой вписке
,Я уже вполне давно замечаю
,Что им проще завидовать, чем расцветать
,Я уже вполне давно не сплю, давно не сплю
,И тебе спать не советую
,Не то я просто уведу твою тёлку, и она будет танцевать мне

, Sometimes nothing is harder than awaking
, In the smoke can't recognize the good things
, Once the dust has settled down all over this town
, The brightest stars collide but the world keeps spinning round
, Why can't I
,
, Jump in the water makes me feel alive
, Now I found my peace of mind
, The sun will follow after the darkest night
, But we are gonna be, gonna be alright
,
, (Will it be alright, will it be alright)
, Keep on reaching for the light
, (Will it be alright, will it be alright)
, Please tell me that it'll be alright
,
, I stand frozen at the point of breaking
, It's the road I've chosen but it feels forsaken
, The time we wasted we can never bring it back
, I'm holding on to all your words, they remind me that
,
, I jump in the water, it makes me feel alive
, I know that I'm no longer blind
, The sun will follow after the darkest night
, I'm safe and you're by my side
,
, (Will it be alright, will it be alright)
, Just keep on reaching for the light
, (Will it be alright, will it be alright)
, Please tell me that it'll be
, Alright
, Alright
, Alright
, Please tell me that it'll be alright
, (Alright)

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me.
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me.
Dispenser Man, if you please
Serve my chick a mess of calories
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me.
Slip back the lid
Scoop everything in sight
Make it a rainbow of red, brown and white
Chocolate chip and everything that's nice
Tutti-frutti once and spumoni twice
Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me.
Spray the whipped cream for at least an hour
Pile it as high as the Eiffel Tower
Load it with nuts, about sixteen tons
Top it with a pizza just for fun
Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me.
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me.
Stack her up with crazy goo
That's the stuff she likes to wade right through
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me.
Now add the cherries
The kind she loves to munch
Skip the banana
Use the whole darn bunch
Drown it with fudge
Six or seven cans
Give her two spoons
She'll eat it with both hands
Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me
Separate checks, it must be
Charge the split to her
The water to me
Oh the banana split's for my baby
And the glass of plain water's for me
Ain't got no money
The glass of plain water's for me

作词 : Jackson
I like cake,
And no mistake.
But, baby, if you insist,
I'll cut out cake
Just for your sake.
Baby, come on,
Knock me a kiss.
I like pie.
I hope to die.
Just get a load of this,
When you get high,
Doggone the pie.
Baby, come on,
Knock me a kiss.
When you press your lips to mine,
'Twas then I understood.
They taste like candy, brandy and wine,
Peaches, bananas, and everything good.
I love jam,
And no flim-flam,
Scratch that off my list.
This ain't no jam,
The jam can scram.
Baby, come on,
Knock me a kiss.
When you press your sweet little lips to mine,
Then I understood, oh babe.
They taste like candy, brandy and wine,
Peaches, bananas, and everything good.

I love jam,
And no flim-flam.
Scratch that off my list.
This ain't no jam,
The jam can scram.
Baby, come on,
Knock me a kiss.
Knock me a kiss
,

,粉雪、舞い散る空に
,そっと手を差し伸べて
,あの日々を思い出していた
,凍えそうな私のことを
,ずっと抱いてくれた
,あなたの優しい声は
,消えないと信じていたのに
,冷たい風に溶け始める
,淡い雪はあなたのようで
,手の平へと涙と共に
,零れはじめた
,もう一度会いたいと願いながら
,冬空を見上げた
,それが届かないと分かっていても
,大切な気持ちは消えはしない
,一人きりの冬の季節は
,こんなにも痛くて涙止まらなくて
,サヨナラ言えないままで…
,もう一度会いたいと願いながら
,冬空を見上げた
,それが届かないと分かっていても
,私を忘れないで
,降り注ぐ雪と雨の中で
,灯火を照らした
,吸い込まれていくあなたの声
,ずっと抱き寄せていたい
,私を忘れないで

,君の笑颜を
,谁かがもう覚えていないかもしれない
,「窓の中空いた席は
,そこからどう映っていますか」と
,君の事知ったように
,何一つ解っていなくて
,少しでもそれを解っていられたなら
,ずっと続いていてくれた様な日々は
,鸣り出したアラームを止める度に无い物だと、気づかされてる
,教室で消えたい心を伤つけて
,何度も隠し通して笑っていた
,ここから飞び降りていなくなった君の笑颜を
,仆は明日も忘れないよ

,And I still remember the scene, when we met
,Knew we'd get this way inevitably
,The angel in her eyes became the devil in me
,Yet I thought it would settle there but never would leave
,I know I made her cry way too much
,Lie after lie, to violate her trust
,I don't know why she gave me love and
,All the time in my mind I was trying to break it up
,But love in the heart of the broken it
,Sometimes comes out as the opposite emotion
,Impossible to show you all of my regrets
,So I just say thank you, hope tomorrow will be better
,Forever, yours
,
,You have changed my life, shown me new worlds
,Gave me joy, in my heart from within you've made your star
,So I dedicate my song to you, know these words
,Come right out, of my soul, they're forever yours
,
,I guess I'll take it as a lesson
,Sometimes you just need a change in your direction
,So stuck in your ways, you're regressing
,Running out of places for the blame to be deflected
,Learning how to give and receive love
,Seeing what freedom really means,
,Once you stop the talking like
,Leaving lies behind, the moment that it had begun
,Found love again, not to rub it in
,Just feel like I owe you for the growth that I underwent
,Looking for it now, let me say my thanks
,Appreciate what I had, won't make the same mistakes
,
,You have changed my life, shown me new worlds
,Gave me joy, in my heart from within you've made your star
,So I dedicate my song to you, know these words
,Come right out, of my soul, they're forever yours

,time to get up, thats right
,I keep it old skool
,lets do this
,I remember when life was just about riding bikes.
,Hanging with my boys through the night understreetlights.
,Simple times. Simple needs. Summertime breeze.
,Football in the street, getting high, climbing trees.
,New york New york to LA I see I you cant frown on whereyou from so I dont try.
,C L, yeah, thinkin blue, I keep it moving.
,Animal guitars man we still keep it grooving.
,We come a long way son I wish I could stay back itspacked its a wrap, it was le say
,You know how I do keep it freesh, Old Skool, with atwisted chill vibes to keep it cool.
,Back on the scene, some eyes turn green, I smile its beena while man I take it to your team.
,sit back and relax 'cuz this is the last ride keep yourarms and legs inside, at all times.
,Old skool thats my vibe from 86 to about 95

,Could be wrong but I think
,When you take center stage not a single eye blinks
,Some forced to squint
,In an awkward attempt
,To somehow filter your glow
,But you know...
,That the polish of your armor got'em in a trance
,Colors intertwine with the power of a dance
,Poetry in motion got'em in a stand still
,Eyes glaze over, jaws drop like anvils
,A feeling you're wishing that even time can't kill
,Sorry to inform you but it can and will
,So make the most of it
,And folks love it
,Is it the bare essentials
,Or the bells and whistles
,Can't tell initially but what remains
,When a fella's history is it the name
,That fades like memories
,Time will tell
,You know that the divine's design prevails
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,We're running out of time and it's funny I guess
,'Cause we strive to make something that it is truly timeless
,That'll never tarnish
,And maintain it's beauty
,But is that the nature of time?
,They say that we got 15 minutes to shine
,But it's all relative
,'Cause 15 minutes can feel like forever if
,We don't believe that time flies
,But you that most are blind to The Inner Minds Eye
,Where people come and go with a blink
,And celebrate your memory and toast with a drink
,Making your exit as their next thought enters
,You've made your deposit in their memory bank
,Hoping one day eventually to gain interest
,Instead of drawing blanks whenever your name's mentioned
,Hot today tomorrow you're cold & lonely
,Tell me where will these songs be...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues

,Will you make your mark or be written out of history
,Stimulate thought or become a nonentity
,When they reminisce over you
,Will they front or give you your dues
,When the luster fades
,Where will you go (go)
,Will you be long forgotten by the people you know (know)
,When you've lost your glow (glow)
,No one at the show (show)
,And your record stop spinning and you're feeling real low (low)
,When the luster fades

,When the luster fades
,Where will the entourage go?
,What will you do if eternal bonds are not so?
,How many women stayed when the money got low?
,When the fans seen it all, will they scream bravo
,Or have a moment of silence, minus the reflection
,Will your records be a valued part of their collection
,In a frame on the wall or end up in a dollar bin
,Will you be forgotten or honored...
,When the luster fades
,Will you be a legend or a distant memory
,Praised by your brethren or a waste of energy

,Ease up to slow and steady you can take it from me
,Because I'm talking from experience it happened to me
,Writing priceless rhymes yet I'm rapping for free

,And the lessons that you take from each lecture
,Measuring the positives and negatives, live and let live
,Never keep a grudge it's a must to forgive
,Because life is too short and we're running out of time
,These minutes move faster than the flow of my rhymes
,Sometimes it gets a little hectic
,Time is moving quickly but our life is still static
,I'm an addict to these beats and rhymes
,But understand at times it's much deeper than these 16 lines
,I got to be patient and keep waiting
,It all works out in the end please believe it
,I've seen it, I've lived it, trust me I know

,Can you take me the looking glass
,Let me turn my vision from all the things past
,Noetic my nature poetic is my folly
,Aesthetics of my sutures symbolic of my calling
,My perception of every fine line
,Is affected expression the artist in mind
,And I'm in time but your vision transcends
,Yet still you involve your will in my ends
,I admit that only a small part I see
,A small fish tryinto envision the whole sea
,And I want to be a visionary bringer of the light
,But many times I feel like
,I'm blind preaching a sight
,That I don't have
,Theres a portion of me lackin
,Telling me to seek a darkness to go back in
,But you reassure me to take heart
,For your light is the catalyst in my mind the spark
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,I am but a product of my nature
,
,Sinking deeper into all my crimes
,
,And many times I wonder if the maker
,
,Has made me with the right design in mind
,
,And I try to explain it all away
,The rhythm of the rains or where their winds sway
,But I find it all futile a figment of my fears
,It all futile a figment of my tears
,Then the sun sets in the night there I see
,The moon shining in the black canvas for me
,So I choose to believe in the message of the sky
,The rising of the son is my only true guide
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,A soulful melody
,

,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same

,I'll never be the same
,
,Oh no
,
,I'll never be the same
,A soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking, pretty loud
My cat is purring and scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave it's time for a show
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
My body is burning it starts to shout
Desire's coming it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages, till storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane

,When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained
,But darlin' when I hold you' don't you know I feel the same
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever and we both know hearts can change
,And it's hard to hold a candle in the cold November rain
,We've been through this such a long long time
,Just tryin' to kill the pain' oh yeah
,But lovers always come and lovers always go
,An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
,Walking away
,If we could take the time to lay it on the line
,I could rest my head' just knowin' that you were mine
,All mine
,So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
,Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain
,Do you need some time' on your own
,Do you need some time' all alone
,Everybody needs some time on their own
,Don't you know you need some time' all alone
,I know it's hard to keep an open heart
,When even friends seem out to harm you
,But if you could heal a broken heart
,Wouldn't time be out to charm you
,Sometimes I need some time' on my own
,Sometimes I need some time' all alone
,Everybody needs some time on their own
,Don't you know you need some time' all alone
,And when your fears subside and shadows still remain
,I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
,So never mind the darkness' we still can find a way
,'Cause nothin' lasts forever even cold November rain
,Don't ya think that you need somebody
,Don't ya think that you need someone

Called her for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
Felt so close but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

Now I'm speechless, over the edge
I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this love bug again

I can't get your smile out of my mind
,
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

Now I'm speechless, over the edge
I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this love bug again

Kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless, baby can't you see?

Now I'm, yeah, oh!

Now I'm speechless, over the edge
I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this love bug again
Hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this love bug again, (oh)
Love bug again, (whoo)
,I used to rule the world /
,Seas would rise when I gave the word /
,Now in the morning I sweep alone /
,Sweep the streets I used to own /
,I used to roll the dice /
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes /
,Listen as the crowd would sing: /
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!" /“
,One minute I held the key /
,Next the walls were closed on me /
,And I discovered that my castles stand /
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand /
,I hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing /
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing /
,Be my mirror my sword and shield /
,My missionaries in a foreign field /
,For some reason I can not explain /
,Once you know there was never, never an honest word /
,That was when I ruled the world /
,It was the wicked and wild wind /
,Blew down the doors to let me in. /
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums /
,People could not believe what I'd become /
,Revolutionaries Wait /
,For my head on a silver plate /
,Just a puppet on a lonely string /
,Oh who would ever want to be king? /
,I hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing /
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing /
,Be my mirror my sword and shield /
,My missionaries in a foreign field /
,For some reason I can not explain /
,I know Saint Peter will call my name /
,Never an honest word /
,But that was when I ruled the world /
,(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
,Hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing /
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing /

,Now  You  all  know
,The  bards  and  their  songs
,When  hours  have  gone  by
,I'll  close  my  eyes
,In  a  world  far  away
,We  may  meet  again
,But  now  hear  my  song
,About  the  dawn  of  the  night
,Let's  sing  the  bards'song
,Ref.:
,Tomorrow  will  take  us  away
,Far  from  home
,Noone  will  ever  know  our  names
,But  the  bards'songs  will  remain
,Tomorrow  will  take  it  away
,The  fear  of  today
,It  will  be  gone
,Due  to  our  magic  songs
,There's  only  one  song
,Left  in  my  mind
,Tales  of  a  brave  man
,Who  lived  far  from  here
,Now  the  bard  songs  are  over
,And  it's  time  to  leave
,Noone  should  ask  You  for  the  name
,Of  the  one
,Who  tells  the  story
,Ref.:
,Tomorrow  will  take  us  away
,Far  from  home
,Noone  will  ever  know  our  names
,But  the  bards'songs  will  remain
,Tomorrow  all  will  be  known
,And  You're  not  alone
,So  don't  be  afraid
,In  the  dark  and  cold
,'Cause  the  bards'songs  will  remain
,They  all  will  remain
,In  my  thoughts  and  in  my  dreams
,They're  always  in  my  mind
,These  songs  of  hobbits,dwarves  and  men
,And  elves
,Come  close  Your  eyes
,You  can  see  them,too
,On a dark desert highway
,Cool wind in my hair
,Warm smell of colitas
,Rising up through the air
,Up ahead in the distance
,I saw a shimmering light
,My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
,I had to stop for the night
,There she stood in the doorway
,I heard the mission bell
,And I was thinking to myself
,This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
,Then she lit up a candle
,And she showed me the way
,There were voices down the corridor
,I thought I heard them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Plenty of room at the Hotel California
,Any time of year
,Any time of year (background)
,You can find it here
,Her mind is Tiffany twisted
,Shes got the Mercedes bends
,Shes got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
,That she calls friends
,How they dance in the courtyard
,Sweet summer sweat
,Some dance to remember
,Some dance to forget
,So I called up the Captain
,Please bring me my wine
,He said
,We havent had that spirit here since 1969
,And still those voices are calling from far away
,Wake you up in the middle of the night
,Just to hear them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely Place
,Such a lovely Place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Theyre livin it up at the Hotel California
,What a nice surprise
,What a nice surprise (background)
,Bring your alibies
,Mirrors on the ceiling
,Pink champagne on ice
,And she said
,We are all just prisoners here
,Of our own device
,And in the masters chambers
,They gathered for the feast
,They stab it with their steely knives
,But they just cant kill the beast
,Last thing I remember
,I was running for the door
,I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
,Relax said the nightman
,We are programed to receive
,You can check out any time you like
,But you can never leave
,She's got a smile that it seems to me
,Reminds me of childhood memories
,Where everything
,Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
,Now and then when I see her face
,She takes me away to that special place
,And if I stared too long
,I'd probably break down and cry
,Ow Sweet child o' mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,She's got eyes of the bluest skies
,As if they thought of rain
,I hate to look into those eyes
,And see an ounce of pain
,Her hair reminds me
,Of a warm safe place
,Where as a child I'd hide
,And pray for the thunder
,And the rain
,To quietly pass me by
,Ow Sweet child o' mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o' mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Ow Sweet child o' mine
,Ow Sweet love of mine
,Where do we go
,Where do we go now
,Where do we go
,Where do we go
,Ow Where do we go now
,Where do we go now
,Ow Where do we go now.....
,Now
,Sweet child o' mine Sweet child o' mine
,LINKIN PARK-WHAT I’VE DONE
,
,
,In this farewell,
,there\'s no blood,
,there\'s no alibi.
,Cause I\'ve drawn regret,
,from the truth,
,of a thousand lies.
,So let mercy come,
,and wash away...
,What I\'ve done,
,I\'ll face myself,
,To cross out
,What I\'ve become,
,Erase myself,
,And let go of
,What I\'ve done.
,Put to rest,
,what you thought of me.
,While I clean this slate,
,with the hands of uncertainty
,So let mercy come,
,and wash away...
,What I\'ve done,
,I\'ll face myself,
,To cross out
,What I\'ve become,
,Erase myself,
,And let go of
,What I\'ve done.
,For what I\'ve done,
,I start again.
,And whatever pain may come,
,Today this ends,
,I\'m forgiving...
,What I\'ve done,
,I\'ll face myself,
,To cross out
,What I\'ve become,
,Erase myself,
,And let go of
,What I\'ve done.
,What I\'ve done,
,Forgiving what I\'ve done.
,
,I cant remember anything
,Cant tell if this is true or dream
,Deep down inside I feel to scream
,This terrible silence stops me
,
,Now that the war is through with me
,Im waking up' I cannot see
,That theres not much left of me
,Nothing is real but pain now
,
,Hold my breath as I wish for death
,Oh please God' wake me
,
,Back in the womb its much too real
,In pumps life that I must feel
,But cant look forward to reveal
,Look to the time when Ill live
,
,Fed through the tube that sticks in me
,Just like a wartime novelty
,Tied to machines that make me be
,Cut this life off from me
,
,Hold my breath as I wish for death
,Oh please God' wake me
,
,Now the world is gone Im just one
,Oh God help me
,Hold my breath as I wish for Death
,Oh please God' help me
,
,Darkness Imprisoning me
,All that I see
,Absolute horror
,I cannot live
,I cannot die
,Trapped in myself
,Body my holding cell
,
,Landmine Has taken my sight
,Taken my speech
,Taken my hearing
,Taken my arms
,Taken my legs
,Taken my soul
,Left me with a life in Hell

It's unfortunate that when we feel a storm
We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
Oh well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grip
Love is like a sin, my love,
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you again

If you disrespect anybody
That you run in to
How in the world do you think
Anybody's s'posed to respect you
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man
With the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentle man do his thing
You the kind of gentleman
That want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you're walking 'round
Think'n that the world
Owes you something
'Cause you're here
You goin' out
The world backwards
Like you did
When you first come here
Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop evolution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution
Oh, you cuss around women
And you don't even know their names
And you dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol man
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself

Stagger Lee
 It was back in '32 when times were hard
 He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards
 Stagger Lee
 He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
 Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
 Stagger Lee
 His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
 And told him, "Never ever come back no more"
 Stagger Lee
 So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
 Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
 Stagger Lee
 He said "Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am"
 The barkeeper said, "No, and I don't give a good goddamn"
 To Stagger Lee
 He said, "Well bartender, it's plain to see
 I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee"
 Mr. Stagger Lee
 Barkeep said, "Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
 And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day"
 Mr Stagger Lee
 Well those were the last words that the barkeep said
 'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head
 Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
 Was known to make more money than any bitch in town
 She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
 Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
 With Stagger Lee
 She saw the barkeep, said, "O God, he can't be dead!"
 Stag said, "Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head"
 She said, "You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
 Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime"
 Mr. Stagger Lee
 "But there's something I have to say before you begin
 You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
 Mr. Stagger Lee"
 "I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
 And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass"
 Said Stagger Lee
 "I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
 And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole"
 Said Stagger Lee
 Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, "You must be
 That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee"
 Stagger Lee
 "Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
 And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead"
 Said Stagger Lee
 Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
 And Stag filled him full of lead
 Oh yeah.

  Standing in the shadows of love
 Waitin' for the heartaches to come
 Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love
 I getting ready for the heartaches to come
 I'd run but there's no where to go
 'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
 Without your love, the love I need
 It's the beginning of the end for me
 'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
 When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
 Now wait a minute
 Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
 Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
 So don't you leave me standin' in the shadow of love
 I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
 Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
 Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
 All alone I'll desperately be
 With misery my only company
 Come today, in fact come tomorrow
 Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
 Don't your conscience bother you
 How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
 Now hold a minute
 Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
 When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
 (Standing in the shadows of love
 Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
 I've tried not to cry out loud
 No gal you ain't gonna help me now
 What did I do to cause all this grief
 Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
 Now wait a minute
 I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
 Now din't I always treat you good, didn't I?
 I'm Standing in the shadows of love
 I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
 Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
 Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
 Standing in the shadows of... ,

I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin'
Look a-there, look a-there
Look a-there, look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all the night my heart was cryin'
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

, I used to think that I could not go on
,And life was nothing but an awful song
,But now I know the meaning of true love
,I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
,If I can see it, then I can do it
,If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
,I believe I can fly
,I believe I can touch the sky
,I think about it every night and day
,Spread my wings and fly away
,I believe I can soar
,I see me running through that open door
,I believe I can fly
,I believe I can fly
,I believe I can fly
,See I was on the verge of breaking down
,Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud
,There are miracles in life I must achieve
,But first I know it starts inside of me
,If I can see it, then I can do it
,If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
,I believe I can fly
,I believe I can touch the sky
,I think about it every night and day

Lookin' at the devil, grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin', I begin to run
Bullets start chasin', I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle, I was on the top
I want to thank you
Falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Stiff all in the collar, fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin', stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party but I could never stay
Many thangs on my mind, words in the way
I want to thank you
Falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Dance to the music all night long
Everyday people sing a simple song
Mama's so happy, mama start to cry
Papa's still singin', you can make it if you try
I want to thank you
Falettinme be mice elf agin
(Oh yeah, different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin
Flamin' eyes of people fear burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much, hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love, dig it for a starter
Dyin' young is hard to take, sellin' out is harder
Thank you falettinme
Be mice elf agin

,- Да..
,- Вы занимались любовью?
,- Нет.
,- Тогда зачем ты с ней встречался?
,-Не знаю поймешь ты или нет..
,Просто я однажды увидел, как из её глаз текли слезы..
,И тогда я понял, что не допущу больше, чтобы она плакала.. Никогда.
,Мне всегда было важно,чтобы она поела.
,Я не хотел её в плане секса.
,Я хотел обнимать её вкино и просыпаться от её нежных поцелуев ..
,Я просто хотел находиться с ней рядом .
,Мне нравилось смотреть как она ест сладкое и как нелепо вытирается рукавом ..
,Как ей звонят разные парни, а она просто говорит:
,"Извини я гуляю с любимым"..
,Она была не такая, как все..
,Она любила меня не так, как все.
,Она любила меня искренне и наивно..
,А я её..Очень сильно.
,Она была моей маленькой девочкой ..
,- Тогда почему вы расстались?
,- Девочка выросла.
,- Но для меня она навсегда осталась маленькой девочкой ..
,- А как же твоя новая девушка?
,- А эта.. Она разукрашенная дура.
,Я не запрещаю ей курить,бухать,мне плевать в чем она одета, мне абсолютно все равно, что она чувствует,ненавижу просыпаться рядом с ней утром ...
,Я всего лишь хочу её.
,А вот ту ... ту я действительно любил ... И люблю ... до сих пор.

,Oh the last time I saw Paul
,I was horrible and almost let him in
,But I stopped and caught the wall
,And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin
,Yeah we hopped inside my car
,And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
,And he turned the headlights off
,Then he pulled the bottle out
,Then he showed me what was love
,I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
,I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
,I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
,I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death
,In the blossom of the months
,I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
,So I swallowed all of it
,As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

,
,Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
,But I'll push you from my brain
,See, you're gentle baby
,I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain
,
,I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
,I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
,We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
,And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left
,
,Sun sets, we wander through a foreign town
,Strangely, there's nobody else around
,See you open you twice and show me your tights
,On the swing set at the old playground
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in the rearview
,Sun sets, I want to hear your voice
,A love that nobody could destroy
,Took photographs like podwer cards
,Book covers that we both adored
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview
,This always happens to me this way
,Recurring visions of such sweet days
,And when you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview
,When you go away, I still see you
,The sunlight on your face in my rearview
,
,The wave of your voice
,Sounds beautiful to me, each time
,The wave of your lingered words
,Got me crying
,And so, I hum too
,Everyday I would listen to you
,Take me to your warm hug
,And when I go blank suddenly
,Your waving voice could lighten me
,The wave of your smile and laugh
,Looks so beautiful to me, each day
,The wave of the way you talk
,Makes the breeze come
,So I could smile again
,Leaving all lies that near come to me
,Keeping me safe and comfy
,I could left all of my stress to you
,And that’s what you are to me
,

,When i saw the first time, the thunder came crashing
,Your new blue eyeliner caught my distraction
,And like we were two lovers forming from fiction
,Your mouth caught my ear with such perfect diction
,And there i let you tie my hands back and take me
,
,O lorraine on a saturday morning
,O lorraine with your soft, burning hands
,We fell asleep in the back of the warehouse
,I woke to you kneading and covering my mouth
,And like we were hummingbirds screaming at ravens
,You started to move me from fact into fable
,And there i let you take me under the table

,Maybe you'll show up somehow

,I've been weak
,Stolen from all the courage i need
,Well how should i know which your lies to believe

,And i will nibble your ear
,I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
,And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
,but My breath fogged up the glass
,And so I drew a new face and laughed
,I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
,To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
,It's what we aim to do
,Our name is our virtue
,But I won't hesitate no more no more

,Either way, make up your mind
,I'm tired of trying to make you mine
,
,Imagine a world that U never knew
,Right above us and it's filled with people just like me and you
,We don't need to make a reservation no it's not a ruse
,I could take you to the spot but there's one thing you got to do
,Tell me how much that it means for you to follow your dreams
,How much money would it take for U leave everything behind
,And be with who you're meant to be together at last
,Fly away to something better than the years that have passed
,Take a big step forward we embrace the unknown
,The anxiety you're feeling will fill up in every bone
,But you're destined  not to be greatly don't believe in your mind
,U want something out the ordinary living divine
,This place is better than you've ever known it ain't a lie
,Because I've seen it and I've felt it with my hands and my eyes
,I'll take it over any destination now we can find
,And it's something so achievable it's all in your mind for you.
,
,No one choose this life for me but I don't mind it
,Cause when I'm down under the rain I feel reminded
,I will devise a plan, up in the skies again
,Knowing that I have been torn down
,But nothing can slow me down even through lows I found
,If I combine what I know now
,
,Imagine a world that you never knew
,Right above us and its filled with people just like me and you
,It's the reason I'm leaving I'm making it come true
,Take hold of how I'm living and making it brand new
,There's a moment of clarity when U see who you are
,The reality is we can be the light in the stars
,That hover over us entirely with the moon and with mars
,We can make this world a better place if we were in charge
,I never had a good agenda 'til the day I relied
,On something bigger than myself that most would hate and despise
,There's a world thats right in front of us that most never try
,To be apart of cause they're busy with the stress in their lives and know
,
,No one chose this life for me but I don't mind it
,Cause when I'm down under the rain I feel reminded
,I will devise a plan up in the skies again
,Knowing that I have been torn down
,But nothing can slow me down even through lows I found
,If I combine what I know now
,
,Throughout the lies and all the infinite times
,That I could never devise the right words to
,Show you that I rely only on time to fly
,But I'm reminded I hurt you
,But within a dream we can be king or a queen
,And we can live in a scene that we made up
,With nothing to fight about we can just fly around
,Up in the sky while we raise up
,while we raise up
,while we raise up
,
,No one chose this life for me but I don't mind it
,Cause when I'm down under the rain I feel reminded
,I will devise a plan up in the skies again
,Knowing that I have been torn down
,But nothing can slow me down even through lows I found
,If I combine what I know now
,No one chose this life for me but I don't mind it
,Cause when I'm down under the rain I feel reminded
,I will devise a plan up in the skies again

,
,Should I tell you
,Will you be glad to hear from me
,Should I let it out of me
,Should I tell you how my week has been
,Or shouldn't I say anything
,How I have gone from room to room
,Followed by those thoughts of you
,I've been walking in and out
,Like I'm not sure where I'm living now
,Should I tell you, should I tell you
,Should I tell you those things
,Should I tell you, should I tell you
,Should I tell you, should I tell you
,Where my heart has been
,Should I tell you
,Should I fill you in
,I will see you one more time
,Should I speak to you about
,Feeling likes  get no rights
,Is that something you would like to hear about
,

没有你的这些日子
我就想没有身体的人一样

没有你的话我会活不下去
快点回来我身边，我爱你
作曲 : Farrux Xamrayev
作词 : Farrux Xamrayev
火 你是火

是我飞蛾的尽头

没想过要逃脱

为什么我要逃脱

谢谢你给我

一段快乐的梦游

如果我忘了我

请帮忙记得我

你是电 你是光

你是唯一的神话

我只爱你 You are my super star

你主宰 我崇拜

没有更好的办法

只能爱你 You are my super star

你是电 你是光
作曲 : Farrux Xamrayev
作词 : Farrux Xamrayev
吵醒沉睡冰山后从容脱逃

你总是有办法轻易做到

一个远远的微笑

就掀起汹涌波涛

又闻到眼泪沸腾的味道

明明你也很爱我

没理由爱不到结果

只要你敢不懦弱

凭什么我们要错过

夜长梦还多

你就不要想起我

嗨，大家好，新闻开始
听我的新闻 不要紧张，不要害怕
我的新闻和电视上的完全不一样
在电视上也不会播放
只会在老百姓当中传播
我的新闻里有讽刺，仔细听会找到意义
从早到晚我们离不开电话，它在你我的手中
最近有个人和智能电话谈了恋爱
不过多久他们就在WiFi餐厅举行了盛大的婚宴
据可靠消息称，离婚率比城市中的白色垃圾塑料袋还多，这意味着什么
在家中看着超有意义的广告，中间插播电视剧或电影，你们搞什么，真让我气愤
**们发誓以后绝不受贿，医院绝不乱收费乱检查乱开药（讽刺）
所谓的明星们爱上了所谓的出书，出自传，慈善家们扛着摄像机，照相机在慈善。（讽刺）
我的新闻里有很多RITOREK HITAP,亲爱的妈妈一向送我的礼物都是书
家庭教育是给下一代心灵的阳光，教育的意义不是造机器人
教育的意义是培养人，不是表演提线木偶
我们的浪费让猪天天过节日，哪个城市的姑娘最漂亮，快投票，连我们的愚蠢都变成了选举
网络的世界是福也是祸，那里面有很多衣冠禽兽还有骚货
当今敢说实话的不是英雄，说谎的技术高超，你才算是这个时代真正英雄（讽刺）
仗义不是英勇。出卖，陷害才是最明智的选择（讽刺）
分地域的人常说，我是这里的，我是那里的，
这里的人固执，那里的人爱吹牛 wowwww

女生们先生们打扰你们了
让说两句正义的话，提醒你们
给你们一个问号 一个感叹号
抱歉让你们受惊了
女生们先生们打扰你们了
让说两句正义的话，提醒你们
给你们一个问号 一个感叹号
然后在歌曲后面留了三个点...

对于有的人来说道德缺陷是光荣的一件事情
我们有标志性的漂亮花帽和KANIWAY衬衫，没必要做Arab
如果你想办事儿，想把事儿的办的快一点
那你就得花钱，如果你花了钱你说了算，
路上卖水果的平民们为了生存天天在奔跑，当然这不是你的偶像节目
他们为了生活，胡须和胡子长得很茂盛
我最喜欢Memtimen Hoshur的故事，
比如 QIRLIQ ESTAKA / QUM BASQAN SHEHER / BURUT MAJRASI/
电视上有很多选秀节目，说实话这种节目已经让我麻木，让我厌烦
我们是爱艺术的，但不是处了艺术什么都没有的
应该多出一些读书类的和爱发明之类的节目，我们缺的就是这个
无辜的小孩被拐卖，带走，心里无比你的哀伤
我想问，农民的生活真的那么好吗？
你为了利益和撒旦妥协，为了损失跟上帝祷告吗？
那些爱演讲的某某老师说话很伟大
其实他们才不会在意平民的哀伤，他们只在乎MONEY
好了，摘下你恶心的面具吧M**F** BABY
真正的慈善家是人民的儿子人民笑话艺术家HIBI

女生们先生们打扰你们了
让说两句正义的话，提醒你们
给你们一个问号 一个感叹号
抱歉让你们受惊了

咖啡也喝过了 还是不如我们的奶茶
有些女孩儿就那样 ，如果你没有稳定的工作，钱和车，
他们是不会嫁给你的，爱情算什么
有些情侣的婚礼不是为了爱情，而是为了交易
在婚宴中比高低，这意味着什么
难道我说的是假的吗？ 
难道他们出生就是小偷吗？
偷别人的东西当然是错误的
但是什么促使他去盗窃，偷东西
我们应该找原因，拯救一个算一个，这不是很好吗，要去感化他们
如果HIPHOP说唱的本意和意义是炫耀，喝酒，抽烟，吹牛，骂街，让人堕落
那么最堕落，邋遢，懒惰，吹牛的人都会成为说唱歌手
冰毒和新型毒品在危害着好多妹妹和弟弟们，破坏他们未来和幸福的家庭
你知道吗，我在流血，不是在眼里而是在心里
你们说的真理是把UNDERGROUND当成口号吗？
要不就是穿HIPHOP的着装，把自己当成说唱歌手吗？
把没有意义的歌词弄成押韵，跟上节奏就是说唱了吗？
这样有没有意义？小可爱们不要再骗自己了
生命是怎么样的？生活是怎么样的
我只是个在学习在努力的人
我知道的东西很少，我只是个普通的探寻者
有些话说出来了，但有些话只能咽下去...
没有傻B在这儿，送给NN腔一样的先生们

女生们先生们打扰你们了

给你们一个问号 一个感叹号
抱歉让你们受惊了

,And Now，hear me jazz, I whisper I love you, I whisper I love you
,Certi capivano il jazz
,l’argenteria spariva
,ladri di stelle e di jazz
,così eravamo noi, così eravamo noi
,Pochi capivano il jazz
,troppe cravatte sbagliate
,ragazzi-scimmia del jazz
,così eravamo noi, così eravamo noi
,Sotto le stelle del jazz,
,ma quanta notte è passata
,Marisa, svegliami, abbracciami
,è stato un sogno fortissimo
,Le donne odiavano il jazz
,non si capisce il motivo
,dab – dab du-dad-du-dad …
,Sotto le stelle del jazz
,un uomo-scimmia cammina,
,o forse balla, chissà
,du-da-du-dad du-da-du-dad
,Duemila enigmi nel jazz
,ah, non si capisce il motivo
,nel tempo fatto di attimi
,e settimane enigmistiche
,Sotto la luna del jazz
,da da di da da …
,And Now， hear me jazz, I whisper I love you, I whisper I love you

, 作词 : Thiele, Weiss
,I see trees of green red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do
,They're really saying I love you
,I hear babies cry I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,There's nothing for me, in this world full of strangers
,It's all someone else's idea
,I don't belong here, and you can't go with me
,You'll only slow me down
,
,Until I send for you, don't wear your hair that way
,If you cannot be true, I'll understand
,Tell all the others, you'll hold in your arms
,That I said I'd come back for you
,I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
,That's all that I can do
,
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,
,I took each word she said as gospel truth
,The way a silly little child would
,I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth
,I was no babe in the wild, wild wood
,She didn't mean it, I should have seen it
,But now it's too late
,I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams
,Now it seems this is how the story ends
,She's gonna turn me down and say
,"Can't we be friends?"“
,I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
,Not for long I can see the way this ends
,She's gonna turn me down and say
,"Can't we be friends?"“
,Why should I care though she gave me the air
,Why should I cry heave a sigh and wonder why
,And wonder why
,I thought I'd found the gal I could trust
,What a bust, this is how the story ends
,She's gonna turn me down and say
,"Can't we be just friends?"“
,I hurt myself today
,To see if I still feel
,I focus on the pain
,The only thing that's real
,The needle tears a hole
,The old familiar sting
,Try to kill it all away
,But I remember everything
,What have I become?
,My sweetest friend
,Everyone I know
,Goes away in the end
,And you could have it all
,My empire of dirt
,I will let you down
,I will make you hurt
,I wear this crown of thorns
,Upon my liar's chair
,Full of broken thoughts
,I cannot repair
,Beneath the stains of time
,The feelings disappear
,You are someone else
,I am still right here
,What have I become?
,My sweetest friend
,Everyone I know
,Goes away in the end
,And you could have it all
,My empire of dirt
,I will let you down
,I will make you hurt
,If I could start again
,A million miles away
,I would keep myself
,I would find a way
,
,We lived our little drama
,We kissed in a feild of white
,And stars fell on Alabama last night
,I can't forget the glamor,your eyes held a tender light
,And stars fell on Alabama last night
,I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
,A fairy land where no one else could enter
,And in the center,just you and me
,My heart beat like a hammer
,My arms wound around you tight
,And stars fell on Alabama last night
,I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly

,Que vivre en paix pour des amants?
,Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt

,And its time time time that you love
,And its time time time
,And they all pretend theyre orphans and their memorys like a train
,You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
,And the things you cant remember tell the things you cant forget
,That history puts a saint in every dream
,Well she said shed stick around until the bandages came off
,But these mamas boys just dont know when to quit
,And Mathilda asks the sailors "Are those dreams or are those prayers?"
,So close your eyes, son, and this wont hurt a bit
,Oh its time time time, and its time time time
,Well things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
,The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street
,And when theyre on a roll she pulls a razor from her boot
,And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
,So put a candle in the window and a kiss upon his lips
,As the dish outside the window fills with rain
,Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
,And pay the fiddler off til I come back again
I see trees of green........ red roses too
I see em bloom..... for me and for you
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue..... clouds of white
Bright blessed days....dark sacred nights
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world.

The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky
Are also on the faces.....of people ..going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin.. how do you do
They're really sayin......i love you.

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more.....than I'll never know
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world

The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky
Are there on the faces.....of people ..going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin.. how do you do
They're really sayin...*spoken*(I ....love....you).

I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
*spoken*(you know their gonna learn
A whole lot more than I'll never know)
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself .......what a wonderful world.
The sky is cryin... Can't you see the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin... Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been looking for my baby
And I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one morning... She was walking on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning... She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
Made my poor heart skip a beat
I've got a real real real real bad feelin
That my baby she don't love me no more
I've got a real real bad feelin that my baby don't love me no more
well, this guy, this guy's been cryin
Can you see the tears roll down my nose

,
Now the pale moon shinin' on the fields below
The folks are crooning soft and low
You needn't tell me by because I know
When it's sleepy time down south
Soft winds blowing through the pine wood trees
The folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls upon her knees
When it's sleepy time down south
Steamboats on the river a coming or a going by ,
Splashing the night away
, hear those banjos ringing, the people are singing
They dance 'til the break of day
Oh dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back, where I belong
Riding in mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time way down south
Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back, where I belong
Riding in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time down south
Sleepy time down south

,Mmm...
,That stormy morning felt like a dream.
,He told me then of what he'd seen.
,A child, a man, in times gone bad.
,Faces of stone lined hard and sad.
,One Sunday day they all came home.
,All that they had was burned and gone.
,The timber men, their pistols gleamed.
,A lifetime lost on Palastine.
,He made a stand.
,He would not run.
,He dropped the hoe and picked up the gun.
,And then one night he disappeared.
,It fed the worst of all their fears.
,They found him quiet high in a tree.
,He flew away from Palastine.
,Mmm......
,Then came the day they moved away.
,More gunmen came.
,They could not stay.
,To Glen St. Mary.
,To Olustee.
,But we still dream of Palastine.
,Mmm.....
,Mmm......
,Mmm......
,Mmm......
,
,And now, the end is near;
,So I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case,
,of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and evry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the by way,
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill, my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say not in a shy way,
,Oh no, oh no, not me,
,I did it my way.
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows
,I did it my way
,
,Yes it was my way

Baby, out all night
Until the break of day
Snap me up in everything I say
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me
What you're doing, baby
You know it ain't right
I wonder what you're doing
That takes all night
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me
Get so disgusted
When I try to kiss you
I just don't feel
Like I used to do
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me
Tried to trail you last night
Baby, in my car
But I'm scared I might see
What I'm looking for
Little by little
Only you know that I can see
Bit by bit
Your love is slipping away from me

Make Yourself Comfortable
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE
Sarah Vaughan &nbsp;&nbsp;
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable, baby.
Take off your shoesies, dear,
And loosen up your tie.
I've got some records here.
Let's try one on for size.
I'll turn the lights down
While you make yourself comfortable, baby.
We hurried through our dinner, Hurried through the dance,
Left before the picture show was through.
Why did we hurry through our dinner,
Hurry through the dance.
To leave some time for this,
To hug-a hug-a kiss and so now
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable.
Mmmmm Mmmmmm Make yourself comfortable, baby.
,You prayed to have your name scattered on the lips of the young.
,Now, you claim that it's you on the tips of their tongue.
,And if you're proud of what you had to kill to get your thrill, well,

,The falling leaves drift by the window
,The autumn leaves of red and gold
,I see your lips, the summer kisses
,The sunburned hands I used to hold
,Since you went away the days grow long
,And soon I hear old winter's song
,But I miss you most of all, my Darling
,When autumn leaves start to fall
,C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
,Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
,Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble
,Toi que m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
,Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
,Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
,Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis
,Since you went away the days grow long

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned away down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home 
I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home 
I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

,Make love to me, my darling
,While there is still a mood
,Must I extend an invitation
,To make love to me
,Make love to me, my darling
,Tonight will end so soon
,There are moments
,When my lips adore addressing you
,But tonight my lips are only for
,Caressing you but how about you
,Before the mood that I'm in changes
,Make love to me
,Make love to me, my darling
,I'm so in love with you
,I can't help it if my lips want kisses
,And my heart begs for love
,I'm so in love with you
,
,Crazy
,Im crazy for feeling so lonely
,I'm crazy
,Crazy for feeling so blue
,I know
,you Loved me as long as you wanted
,Then some day
,You leave me for somebody new
,Worry, why do I let myself worry
,Wondering what in the world do I do
,Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
,I'm crazy for trying,and crazy for crying
,and I'm crazy for loving you
,Crazy
,for thinking that my love could hold you
,I'm crazy for crying, I'm crazy for crying
,and I'm crazy for loving you
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,L is for the way you look at me
,O is for the only one I see
,V is very, very extraordinary
,E is even more than anyone that you adore
,
,Love is all that I can give to you
,Love is more than just a game for two
,Two in love can make it
,Take my heart and please dont break it
,Love was made for me and you

,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek
,Oh! I love to climb a mountain
,And to reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh! I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through to
,Heaven I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

,Give me a kiss before you leave me,
,And my imagination will feed my hungry heart.
,Leave me one thing before we part,
,A kiss to build a dream on.
,When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you,
,Weaving romances, making believe they're true.
,Oh, give me your lips for just a moment,
,And my imagination will make that moment live.
,Give me what you alone can give,
,A kiss to build a dream on.

,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing

,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

,Cause If you like the way you look that much
,Oh baby you should go and love yourself
,And If you think that I'm still holding on
,To something, you should go and love yourself
,When you told me that you hated my friend
,The only problem was with you and not them
,And everytime you told me my opinion was wrong
,And try to make me forget where I came from
,And I didn't wanna write a song

,They tell me I'm too young to understand
,They say I'm caught up in a dream
,Life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes

,So wake me up when it's all over
,When I'm wiser and I'm older
,All this time I was finding myself
,And I didn't know I was lost

,But I only have two hands
,I hope I get the chance to travel the world
,But I don't have any plans
,Wish that I could stay forever this young
,Not afraid to close my eyes
,Life's a game made for everyone
,And love is the prize

,Nothing to show
,Summer's here, but I'm cold
,Go, summer blues, go
,My tears dry as the wind blows
,Go, summer blues, go
,My tears dry as the wind blows
,Go, summer blues, go
,My tears dry as the wind blows
,Go, summer blues, go
,My tears dry as the wind blows

,Was a cowboy I knew in south Texas,
,His face was burnt deep by the sun,
,Part history, part sage, part mesquit,
,He was there when Poncho Villa was young.
,And he'd tell you a tale of the old days,
,When the country was wild all around,
,Sit out under the stars of the Milky Way,
,And listen while the coyotes howl.
,And they go... hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoodi hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoo di hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,Now the long horns are gone,
,And the drovers are gone,
,The Comanches are gone,
,And the outlaws are gone,
,Geronimo is gone,
,And Sam Bass is gone,
,And the lion is gone,
,And the red wolf is gone.
,Well he cursed all the roads and the oil men,
,And he cursed the automobile,
,Said this is no place for an hombre like I am,
,In this new world of asphalt and steel.
,Then he'd look off some place in the distance,
,At something only he could see,
,He'd say all that's left now of the old days,
,Those damned old coyotes and me.
,And they go hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoodi hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoo di hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,Now the long horns are gone,
,And the drovers are gone
,The Comanches are gone
,And the outlaws are gone,
,Now Quantro is gone,
,Stan Watie is gone,
,And lion is gone,
,And the red rolf is gone.
,One morning they searched his adobe,
,He disappeared without even a word,
,But that night as the moon crossed the mountain,
,One more coyote was heard.
,And he'd go, hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoodi hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,hoo yip hoo yip hoo
,hoo di hoo di yip hoo di yip hoo
,hoo yip hoo yip hoo

,"How many more days can you hold out,
,How much longer can you wait?" she asked.
,There was a time I thought I, I could answer
,But my tongue gets tied as my thoughts drift away.
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,The sun is shining, shining down
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,I'm alive and I'm feeling, feeling fine
,All those simple thoughts all those peaceful dreams,
,Share the space with a hard worked, hard worked day
,But it's the little things, the little things not expectation
,That make life worth living, worth living.
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,The sun is shining, shining down
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,I'm alive, and the world Lord, world is fine
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,The sun is shining, shining down
,Glory, Glory - Hallelujah
,I'm alive and I'm feeling Lord, feeling, feeling, feeling fine.

,A good friend of mine,
,near the end of his time.
,Told me something I will never forget:
,"Son, when I pass away,
,remember each day,
,that these were the words I last said.
,I've got nothing but love,
,nothing but love.
,Here in my heart and soul,
,and it shines on each day.
,In some mystical way,
,like the moon, like the river, rolls."
,Then he smiled and passed on,
,but I sat through the dawn.
,And I thought of one more thing,
,that he said:
,"When a push comes to shove,
,you must answer with love.
,Oh, you throw me a brick,
,I'll hand you a piece of bread.
,I've got nothing but love,
,nothing but love,
,here in my heart and my soul.
,And it shines on each day,
,in some mystical way,
,like the moon, like the river, rolls.
,I've got nothing but love,
,want nothing but love.
,People, people, here in my heart.
,Oh, in my soul.
,And it shines on each day,
,in some mystical way.
,like the moon, like the river, rolls.
,Like the river rolls, like the river rolls."

, When you were young
, And on your own
,How did it feel to be alone
,I was always thinking of games that I was playing
,Trying to make the best of my time
,But only love can break your heart
,Try to be sure right from the start
,Yes, only love can break your heart
,What if your world should fall apart
,I have a friend I've never seen
,He hides his head inside a dream
,Someone should call him
,and see if he can come out
,Trying to lose the down that he's found
,But only love can break your heart
,Try to be sure right from the start
,Yes, only love can break your heart
,What if your world should fall apart
,I have a friend I've never seen

,And I love you so
,The people ask me how
,How I've lived till now
,I tell them I don't know
,I guess they understand
,How lonely life has been
,But life began again
,The day you took my hand
,And yes I know how lonely life can be
,The shadows follow me
,And the night won't set me free
,But I don't let the evening get me down
,Now that you're around me
,And you love me too
,Your thoughts are just for me
,You set my spirit free
,I'm happy that you do
,The book of life is brief
,And once a page is read
,All but love is dead
,That is my believe
,And yes I know how loveless life can be

,But I don't let the evening bring me down

,You can't hide from the truth

,So disappear, vanish if you wish
,Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness
,And the truth is you can't hide from the truth
,And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
,I realized some time ago that I would have to let you go
,May not be true to see that you would return one day

,The people versus, you ain't no Sensi
,Teaching that style of word-play
,We got the words they
,Regardless of what your friends say
,They're all disable
,Striken from the record and deemed indimissable
,And this long arm of the law grabs a mighter
,Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
,The death sentence of this live litagator
,Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
,Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
,Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
,But when you read back verbatim
,What they're saying to pursuade them
,They realize exactly how i've played them
,I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
,'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with lies will
,I brew skill with free fills from now until
,Plagerizing MC's get their flows distilled
,Baby I don't die without you by my side
,As long as you return into these arms that burn
,Baby I won't die just take a look inside
,Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn
,I won't die, if you leave me high
,I won't die if you're not by my side
,And the truth hurts because the truth is all there is

See dat man sittin' in front of the border line
he ain't got the time to argue whats yours and what is mine
See dat man holdin' his hand out in desperation
he don't see salvation no god and sure no nation
We all workin' for the means to the end of our situation
We all hopin' for the day that the powers see abdication and run
Said it gonna come, it gonna come
See dat man sittin' in front of the Jewelry store
he can't walk no more he just too damn poor
See dat man holdin' his eyes from the glarin' sun
he ain't got no one his hopes all been undone
We all workin' for the means to the end of our situation
We all hopin' for the day that the powers see abdication and run
Said it gonna come, it gonna come
Nothin' good comes from nothin'
nothin' comes from nothin' good
Why you spend the whole day bluffin'
come on man do what you should
What you mean the world ain't easy
What you mean the world ain't mine
last I checked there were no price tags
hangin' on them shady pines
what you say when you say nothin'
what you mean when you say lies
politician tell me somethin'
what you got behind them eyes, cause
We all workin' for the means to the end of our situation
We all hopin' for the day that the powers see abdication and run
Said it gonna come, Lord Said it gonna come

,blue moon,
,you saw me standing alone
,without a dream in my heart
,without a love on my own.
,blue moon,
,you knew just what i was there for
,you heard me saying a prayer for
,somebody i realy could care for.
,and then there suddenly appeared before me,
,the only one my arms will ever hold
,i heard somebody whisper, "please adore me."
,and when i looked,
,the moon had turned to gold.
,blue moon,
,now im lo longer alone
,without a dream in my heart
,without a love on my own.
,
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh, I love to climb a mountain
,And to reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh, I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through
,To heaven, yes, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through
,To heaven,  I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, out together dancing
,Out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Now you say you're lonely
,
,You cry the whole night through
,
,Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
,
,I cried a river over you
,
,Now you say you're sorry
,
,For bein' so untrue
,
,Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
,
,I cried a river over you
,
,You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
,
,While you never shed a tear
,
,Remember, I remember all that you said
,
,Told me love was too plebeian
,
,Told me you were through with me and
,
,Now you say you love me
,
,Well, just to prove you do
,
,Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
,
,I cried a river over you

,I waited 'til I saw the sun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I left you by the house of fun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,When I saw the break of day
,I wished that I could fly away
,Instead of kneeling in the sand
,Catching teardrops in my hand
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Out across the endless sea
,I would die in ecstasy
,But I'll be a bag of bones
,Driving down the road along
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Something has to make you run
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I feel as empty as a drum
,I don't know why I didn't come

,When you walk in the bar,
,And you dressed like a star,
,Rockin' your F me pumps.
,And the men notice you,
,
,With your Gucci bag crew,
,Can't tell who he's lookin' to.
,
,Cuz you all look the same,
,Everyone knows your name,
,And that's you whole claim to fame.
,
,Never miss a night,
,Cuz your dream in life,
,Is to be a footballers wife.
,You don't like players,
,
,That's what you say-a,
,But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.
,
,You don't like ballers,
,They don't do nothing for ya,
,But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller.
,You're more than a fan,
,
,Lookin' for a man,
,But you end up with one-nights-stands.
,
,He could be your whole life,
,If you got past one night,
,But that part never goes right.
,
,In the morning you're vexed,
,He's onto the next,
,And you didn't even get no taste.
,
,Don't be too upset,
,If they call you a skank,
,Cuz like the news everyday you get pressed.
,
,You don't like players,
,That's what you say-a,
,But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire.
,
,Or them big balers,
,Don't do nothing for ya.
,But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller,
,
,You can't sit down right,
,Cuz you jeans are too tight,
,And your lucky its ladies night.
,
,With your big empty purse,
,Every week it gets worse,
,At least your breasts cost more than hers.
,
,So you did Miami,
,Cuz you got there for free,
,But somehow you missed the plane.
,
,You did too much E,
,Met somebody,
,And spent the night getting cane.
,
,Without girls like you,
,There'd be no fun,
,We'd go to the club and not see anyone.
,
,Without girls like you,
,There's no nightlife,
,All those just go home to their wives.
,
,Don't be mad at me,
,Cuz your brushing thirty,
,And your old tricks no longer work.
,
,You should have known from the job,
,That you always get dumped,
,So dust off your fuck me pumps.

Lookin' at the devil grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin', I begin to run
Bullets start chasin', I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle, I was on the top
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Stiff all in the collar, fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin', stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party but I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind, words in the way
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Dance to the music all night long
Everyday people, sing a simple song
Mama's so happy, mama starts to cry
Papa's still singin', you can make it if you try
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Flamin' eyes of people fear burnin' into you

Youth and truth are makin' love, dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take, sellin' out is harder

,Hey hey yeah
,I got to scam
,I got to scam
,wow got to scam
,You say you fight to give us freedom
,But often more than not this is abused
,And the faces of a tired generation
,have decided they are sick of being used
,for the purpose of current declarations
,Still the same,
,it'll never change until the end
,Is to buy appreciation of the nation
,To cover the mistakes you must defend
,And you say there'll be a chance for everyone
,to protest against your calculated greed
,But I can see into the future
,Won't be long before the welfare
,Send me letters telling me how much they need
,And it's not been in my interest to please them
,For the only interest rate to fall is mine
,See a brand new generation in demanding
,What you've been doing with out money all this time
,Scam ,People try living life at speed of light
,Scam ,Don't know why but I have to do the things I do
,Scam, Give me ten, that's the move I give you five
,Scam, People say it's the way to stay alive
,Scam
,Scam
,I know you gotta scam
,I know you gotta scam
,So you see you have to be a schemer
,If you wanna love the life you have to live
,And it don't matter how much I earn '
,Cos I always get my fingers burned
,When the man gets down to his business
,And I've been sear sear searching for a reason
,Why I have to give it all up just when I want to get ahead
,See I had to lose car, job, wife, dog and home
,Debts and threats on the telephone
,Maybe I should bust a move instead
,Now we all know when we watch the television
,Not confused between a puppet or conviction
,Glued to the screen by a thousand shallow words of widsom
,It ain't what it seems when it's a single sided system
,Someone's got a hold on my living
,So I'm gonna have to do the things that's fair
,They got to justify for what I should be giving
,Should I lie, should I steal or should I care '
,Cos now I've got to scam
,scam might not love your way
,Scam ,People try living life at speed of light
,Scam ,Don't know why but I have to do the things I do
,Scam,hey, never bout to got to scam
,now scam,
,wow but still move as quickly as you can
,Scam, right on
,
,I've must have died and gone to heaven
,Cause it was a quarter past eleven
,On a Saturday in 1999
,Right across on where I'm standing
,On a dance floor she was landing
,It was clear that she was from another time
,Like some baby barbarella with the stars as her umbrella
,She asked me if I liked to magnetise
,Do I have to go star-trekking
,Cause it's you  that I should be checking
,So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes
,She 's just a cosmic girl from another galaxy
,My heart is at zero gravity
,She's from a cosmic world
,Putting me on ecstacy
,Transmitting on my frequency
,She's cosmic
,I'm scanning on my radars
,Well she said she's from a quasar
,Forty thousand million light years away
,It's a distant solar system
,I tried to phone but they don't listen
,So I asked her for a number all the same
,She said,step in my transporter so I can teleport ya
,All around my heavenly body
,This could be a close encounter
,I should take care not to flounder
,Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face
,She's just a cosmic girl
,From another galaxy
,My heart's at zero gravity
,Sh's from a cosmic world
,Putting me in ecstacy
,Transmitting on my frequency
,She's cosmic
,(Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face)
,She's just a cosmic girl
,From another galaxy
,Transmitting on my frequency
,Yeah cosmic'oh
,Can you be my cosmic woman
,I need you,I want you to be my cosmic girl for the rest of time
,I'm losing my mind,oh cosmic girl yeah

,Music is a world within itself
,With a language we all understand
,With an equal opportunity
,For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
,But just because a record has a groove
,Don't make it in the groove
,But you can tell right away at letter A
,When the people start to move
,
,They can feel it all over
,They can feel it all over people
,They can feel it all over
,They can feel it all over people
,
,Music knows it is and always will
,Be one of the things that life just won't quit
,But here are some of music's pioneers
,That time will not allow us to forget
,For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
,And the king of all Sir Duke
,And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
,There's no way the band can lose
,
,You can feel it all over

,Watch the temple topple over
,To bring the pieces back together
,Rediscover communication
,The poetry
,That comes from the squaring off between
,And the circling is worth it
,Finding beauty in the dissonance
,There was a time that the pieces fit
,But I watched them fall away
,Mildewed and smouldering
,Strangled by our coveting
,I've done the math enough to know
,The dangers of our second guessing
,Doomed to crumble unless we grow

,How good or bad' happy or sad
,Does it have to get?
,Losing yourself' no cry for help
,You don’t think you need it
,And old friends are just a chore'
,But now you need them more than ever before
,All that glitter and all that gold
,Won’t buy you happy
,When you’ve been bought and sold
,Riding white horses' you can’t control
,With all your glitter
,And all of your gold
,Take care of your soul
,Take care of your soul
,How high' how low' how on your own
,Are you gonna get?
,Because
,Losing your soul' will cost you more
,Than the life you’re paying for
,And all those friends you left behind
,You might need ’em when it’s cold outside
,All that glitter and all that gold
,Won’t buy you happy
,When you’ve been bought and sold
,Riding white horses' you can’t control
,With all your glitter
,And all of your gold
,Take care of your soul
,One day you’re gonna wake up and find that
,New dream is losing its shine and
,Nobody is by your side
,When the rain comes down and you’re losing your mind
,So' who you gonna run to?
,Where you gonna hide?
,Glitter and gold
,Won’t keep you warm
,On those lonely nights
,And all those friends that were such a chore
,You’re gonna need them more than ever before
,All that glitter and all that gold
,Won’t buy you happy
,When you’ve been bought and sold
,Riding white horses' you can’t control
,With all your glitter
,And all of your gold
,Take care of your soul
,With all of your gold
,Take care of your soul
,Take care of your soul
,Oh, I think I got you figured out
,Boy, I think I know what you are all about
,Finally, I can finally see you pull the darkness right down over me
,But now I see
,Everybody knows that I'm a mess
,Everybody knows you stole the heart from out my chest
,Every thing you ever said was a lie
,You're hiding behind your sweet, your sweet goodbyes
,I'm black and blue 'cause I fell for you
,You said you never would let me go
,Ooh, how could I ever know?
,I'm black and blue and in love with you

,I'm always falling, over and over
,But I'll get up, I'll make it
,I need some time to un-break it
,I feel like I'm falling, I'm falling far away from you

,I’ve just noted that my skin
,Is a bit clearer than usual
,It whistles within.
,Just did you see the light is burnin’ now through me
,In a minute oh oh
,I’ll make out a patch on the sofa behind me
,So please, put your hands on me to be sure I’m still living.
,And if you can, hold me as hard as you can
,It gives me a shape, a substance of a shade
,You don’t need to find the right words.
,I am invisible, so invisible
,But when you touch me you see me with your hands, oh
,I am invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end,
,So touch me.
,There’s dust flowin’ in my veins,
,Sparklin’ in electric lights then fallin as lil’ snowflakes
,And awful drafts yells in my brest and chills
,I fell to the ground even if I can’t see they’re still hold my soul
,Oh but please, come closer and define all lines of what I am,
,Then give me a shape a substance and a shade,
,I am whisper not too far away from you and easy
,I am invisible, so invisible
,But when you touch me you see me with your hands, oh
,I am invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end,
,Oh, Tell me well I am just invisible so invisible,
,when you touch me you can see me with your hands.
,Oh, no, oh
,I’m just invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end, oh at the end.
,Transparency, now can you see me fadin’
,Transparency，indeed a system failin’
,Like a fresh stitch to praise my poor and rain all over vanishing a moment
,But ain’t no way I see no explanation to watch it here I have to face the fact that I’m disappearing
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,Desperately searching for reflection in a mirror.
,Pull up in my hair lots of questions in my head
,I can’t figure out if I’m alive or if I’m dead, u forget to
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,Desperately searching for a purpose in a mirror
,While I’m watching I’m putting up my fire
,I can’t seem to be seen that I need to be admired.
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,I can’t seem to be seen that I need to be admired
,Take a moment take breeze and think it over
,Midnight leaving now.
,You prayed to have your name scattered on the lips of the young.
,Now, you claim that it's you on the tips of their tongue.
,And if you're proud of what you had to kill to get your thrill, well,
,I bet it stings to give up everything
,and realize that they don't want you.

,It's a lonely road where the

,It's a long way down to the
,sacred ground where the reaper's playing for keeps
,Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh-ow
,The hollow sound is ringing where your heart used to be.
,Have you found that your admiration will never set you free?
,Get your lies prepared,
,you're next in line for judgement day, now,

Written：Charles Segar/Willie Broonzy
I got the key to the highway,
Billed out and bound to go.
I'm gonna leave here running;
Walking is most too slow.
I'm going back to the border
Woman, where I'm better known.
You know you haven't done nothing,
Drove a good man away from home.
Live Verse:　When the moon peeks over the mountains
I'll be on my way.
I'm gonna roam this old highway
Until the break of day.
Oh give me one, one more kiss mama
Just before I go,
'Cause when I leave this time you know I,
I won't be back no more.
First Verse
Second Verse
  Hummingbird
 Jimmy Page
 
 Sometimes I get little impatient
 But she cools me withouth words
 And she comes so sweet and so plain,
 My hummingbird and have you heard,
 
 That I thought my life had ended
 But I find that it's just begun,
 'Cause she gets me where I live
 I'll give all I have to give
 I'm talking about that hummingbird
 
 Oh she's little and she loves me,
 Too much for words to say
 When I see her in the morning sleeping,
 She's little and she loves me and she doesn't
 It's gonna be my lucky day
 Hummingbird don't fly away
 
 When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
 She knows the words to say
 And she gives me just a little understanding,
 In her special way
 And I just have to say,
 
 In my life I've loved no other
 Because she's more. more, more, much more than I deserve,
 And she gets me where I live
 I'll give all I have to give
 I'm talking about that hummingbird
 
 Oh she's little and she loves me,
 Too much for words to say
 When I see her in the morning sleeping,
 She's little and she loves me and she doesn't
 It's gonna be my lucky day
 Hummingbird don't fly away
 
 Oh she's little and she loves me,
 Too much for words to say
 When I see her in the morning sleeping,
 She's little and she loves me and she doesn't
 It's gonna be my lucky day
 Hummingbird don't fly away ,
 Hummingbird don't you fly away

Woke this mornin' feelin' round for my shoes 
But you know by that,

Lord I feel like blowin' my old lonesome horn 
Got up this mornin', my little 
Bernice was gone, 
Lord I feel like blowin' my lonesome horn 
Well I got up this mornin', whoa all

Well, leave this mornin' if 
I have to, ride the blinds 
I feel mistreated, and 
I don't mind dyin' 
Leavin' this mornin', if 
I have to ride the blind 
Babe, I've been mistreated, baby and 
I don't mind dyin' 
Well, some people tell me that the worried blues ain't bad 
Worst old feelin' 
I most ever had 
Some people tell me that these old worried old blues ain't bad 
It's the worst old feelin', 
I most ever had 
She's got a elgin movement from her head down to her toes 
Break in on a dollar most anywhere she goes 
Ooh, from her head down to her toes 
Lord, she break in on a dollar, most anywhere she goes
,
,I Heard the one about your man
,Lord, he've even messing you round
,He's been stepping out on the street
,Lord, I think he's hanging out
,Ain't nobody had him yet this week but it won't take long
,Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
,Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
,Lord, lord, there's trouble in the city
,And I hope it won't mess with me

,back when our love use to be
,Unconditional
,
,When no questions were asked
,no reasons to doubt
,but an absolute truth
,that's what it was all was about
,back when love use to be
,Unconditional
,
,
,With no intention to change
,the initial thrill
,spend hours to inhale
,the irresistible you
,back when love used to be
,Unconditional

Lyrics：Tyler Music：Tyler
Can't be in love, When ya live alone
Push comes to shove, when you bitch and moan
Now look it here babe, you know I'm talking about you without a doubt
Said the music does the talking , but all you got is talk about it
and let the girls all left behind
And put ya woman, now n' I'll spend time
With me and the boys and the toys..(yeah . . . baby)
Rosie she was 5ft 2 with blonde hair, by crackie, n' eyes of blue
Sukie she was on my side, cuz She and Nancy,oh they took me for a ride
those girls all left behind and put ya woman, now I'll spend time
With me and the boys, what to do (yeah) with their toys
ya' talk about it
walk about it
talk about it
talk all about it
ya rock about
talk about
walk about
talk about
I warned ya bout it
talked about it
talk about
Bet ya' mama you'll never guess how my brothers other gigs are goin (now I know)
cant be in love when ya live alone
Push comes to shove when you bitch and moan
she looked good about 35 to me when mine was still coming
on clearbut i was covered back, back then cuz me and the boys knew her career
the girls all left behind
And put ya woman, and now i find, it's about time
me and the boys and our toys, in the attic (ha ha hu)
Her sister she was lanky thin
Never thought of giving in, her candle of youth was burning low
oh me and me and the boys knew someone had to go
the girls all left behind and put ya woman, now I'll spend time
while me and the boys . . .
get to do the songs I wanted covered
you talk about it
you walk about it
talked about
dont you ever get lonely ? Everybody's never gonna' guess
papa, momma, momma . . .theres no shame in . . . starting new . . .
Cant be in love, when ya live alone
Push comes to shove when you bitch and moan
We’ve all been dehumanized
A generation of the same old lies
Security is the alibi
We lose a day in the cycle of life
Evolution of your fellow man
Going around circles in the desert sand
We lose the loved ones protecting us
It’s just another day
Chorus:
On this memorial day
The hippies and the poets and the Spartans say
Forget the reasons why we war
This is the season we’ve been waiting for
Memorial day
It’s a rich man’s war but the poor will pay
Since the logic never comes to mind
Innocence is lost and guilt will fade in time
You turn around to face your death
You wish your mother could be there
To share your last breath
Another good one has gone down
And we mourn the lost
Chorus
Turn on your TV, watch a movie and lay back
Pollute your mind you’re next in line
Insanity is just a matter of time
Chorus
On memorial day
Be strong, let peace be the way
Break the cycle of hate and lies
Let the truth be realized
Memorial day...memorial day!

, I been run down, I been lied to,
, I don't know why I let that mean woman make me a fool.
, She took all my money, wrecked my new car.
, Now she's with one of my goodtime buddies,
, They're drinkin' in some crosstown bar.
, Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,
, Like I been tied to the whipping post,
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.
, My friends tell me, that I've been such a fool,
, And I have to stand by and take it baby, all for lovin' you.
, Drown myself in sorrow, and I look at what you've done.
, But nothin' seems to change, the bad times stay the same,
, And I can't run.
, Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,
, Like I been tied to the whipping post
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.
, Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,
, Like I been tied to the whipping post
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Tied to the whipping post,
, Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'.

,Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
,Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
,You say I've been spending my money on other women
,You've been taking money from someone else
,I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
,I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
,Well your mother said "Son"
,"Don't call my daughter no more"
,Come back home baby, try my love one more time
,Come back home baby, try my love one more time
,If I don't go on and quit you
,I'm gonna lose my mind
,
,Have you heard that rumour
,That's going around
,You got it made  way across town
,It's the same old story
,Tell me where does it end
,Yes  I heard the news
,It's the same old blues again
,When I wrote you a letter
,You must have read it wrong
,I stood at your doorway
,But you was gone
,I took a lot of courage
,And let the telephone ring
,It's the same old blues
,Same old blues again
,When you give me the business
,You know I get a mind
,Cause I've got a lot of patience
,And I've got a lot of time
,It's the same old story
,Tell me where does it end
,It's the same old blues
,Same old blues again
,I'm gonna find me a mountain
,I'm gonna hide out
,I ain't talking to you
,And I ain't coming out
,Yeah  I heard that rumour
,Tell me where does it end
,It's the same old blues
,Same old blues again
With my winter time
My idols and stage fright
In another night
Where the lights are loud and bright
One dream from waking up saved
Too shy to hold in the rage
I know no luxury
Of knowing what your eyes read
I know one million ways
To always pick the wrong thing to say
A love that you never gave
Always a time zone away
It's not out of spite
I know what's right
Bad Luck Blue 
Eyes Goodbye
Sometimes a memory
Only sees what it wants to believe
And what's filled in between
Are days and nights that don't mean a thing
Such a simple suicide
A second chance never tried
And you don't understand
I need a helping hand
So you think that you've seen it all
Is that a fact?
So out your mouth a dictionary
Spouts about this and that
You got your do's, your don'ts
Because and why
I don't trust no one who don't
Take their own advice
Bad Luck Blue 
Eyes Goodbye

,And then there was you

,Chase you to the water's end, water's end, found at the start again
,"Sorry"'s a word she's never known, I left her alone, left her alone
,So we run, run, searching for signs
,Fell out of line, caught in a landslide and couldn't survive
,In over our head, our hopes and regrets, done from the moment we started
,Keep, keep holding on, after she's gone, after she's gone
,Night, the night turns to dawn, wait for the sun, wait for the sun
,And then there was you
,And then there was you

,Nothing to lose
,Nothing to lose
,Nothing to lose
,Nothing to lose
,No parachute to ease my fall
,Crashing colliding until I feel so small
,Not really proving even though I thought I was, I was
,Outsiders, sinking fast, nothing to fill this empty glass
,I forgot who I was supposed to be, to be
,And then there was you
,And then there was you
,I was so lost, before your colors broke through
,And then there was you
,And then there was you
,Run towards this light, 'cause we've got nothing to lose

,Started the countdown as soon as I left in the morning
,It's a sad fuss these hands cant move me closer to you fast enough
,Sick, wicked games they're keepin' me from my danger love
,Hot as a cast iron, in 30 days I'll be hotter than pure molten lava

,Stepping Stones
,歌手：Dave Thomas Junior
,所属专辑：The Lucky Ones
,Reaching out but the past can't save you
,Wondering what all the empty souls do
,Nobody can be sure
,And if the words go around in circles
,When's the best time to stop just cut it off
,Quit searching for the cure
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,And if all this is really happening
,Look away we don't know where to begin
,Or what we're waiting for
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Holding on just holding on
,Nothing left keep moving cause
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Forgetting how to swim
,I'm forgetting how to swim
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go~

,IN A HEART SHAPED BOX WITH A LOCK ON TOP
,AND I’M FALLING NOW
,LIKE A TREE IN A STORM YOU’RE THE LIGHTNING SHOCK
,I START TO SHAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
,WHEN I HEAR YOUR VOICE IT’S A FEELING INSIDE
,IT’S THE SOUND OF A TRAIN OF A TRAIN COMING OFF THE TRACKS
,I LIE AWAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
,IF I SEE YOUR FACE WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES
,YOU’RE A SHOT TO THE HEART I’M A STAR SHOOTING OFF THE MAP
,I’LL RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND DIVE INTO THE OCEAN
,FIND A CAVE TO HIDE MY HEAVY EMOTION
,IT TAKES MORE THAN WATER TO DROWN YOU OUT
,IT TAKES MORE THAN FIRE TO BURN YOU DOWN
,I START TO SHAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
,WHEN I HEAR YOUR VOICE IT’S A FEELING INSIDE
,IT’S THE SOUND OF A TRAIN OF A TRAIN COMING OFF THE TRACKS
,I LIE AWAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
,IF I SEE YOUR FACE WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES
,YOU’RE A SHOT TO THE HEART I’M A STAR SHOOTING OFF THE MAP
,There is a house built out of stone
,Wooden floors, walls and window sills
,Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
,This is a place where I don't feel alone
,This is a place where I feel at home
,And I built a home
,For you
,For me
,Until it disappeared
,From me
,From you
,And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust
,Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
,There is a tree as old as me
,Branches were sewn by the color of green
,Ground had arose and passed its knees
,By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
,I climbed the tree to see the world
,When the gusts came around to blow me down
,I held on as tightly as you held onto me
,I held on as tightly as you held onto me
,And I built a home
,For you
,For me
,Until it disappeared
,From me
,From you
,And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust
,You left it, I sent it
,I want it back
,You left it, I sent it
,I want it back
,If I had you here, I'd clip your wings
,Snap you up and leave you sprawling on my pin
,This plan of mine is oh so very lame
,Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains
,You left, I died,
,I went and you cried
,You came, I think
,But I never really know
,I've served my time
,I've watched you climb
,The wrong incline
,But what do I know
,Accept it, Don't let it
,Turn the screw
,Accept it, And let it
,Scream back at you
,Now this applies both equally to you and I
,The only thing we share
,Is the same sky
,These empty metaphors，They're all in vain
,Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains
,In the garden Snake was a charmin'
,And Eve said let's give it a try
,Now lead us not into temptation
,But no matter how hard I try
,When in the garden and
,Snake is a charmin'
,And Eve says let's give it a try
,Eve is the apple of my eye
,Eve is the apple of my eye
,And I lie behind you
,And a cradle you in the palm of me
,And I pat your hair down
,I think will we sink or swim?
,'Cause we could do either on a whim
,
,I remember
,City lakeside in september
,We watched the sun come up
,Leaves drift yellow from the shore
,You slipped out of your clothes
,Broke the surface where you dove
,Never been so in love
,Water's never been so cruel
,Blurring out the shape you make
,Scattering the lines of you
,When you move
,When you move
,When you move
,Swimming over
,You eased out up to your shoulders
,You told me not to look
,Stole a glance while you were turned
,Droplets left your skin
,Diamonds following your curves
,Never been so in love
,Water's never been so cruel
,Running down your silhouette
,Tracing every part of you
,When you move
,When you move
,Then the sun broke through
,The fog was lifting up
,I was so transfixed
,As you were drying off
,When you looked at me
,Eyes the deepest blue
,There was nothing else
,It was only you
,When you move
,When you move
,I never been so in love
,I never been so in love
,When you move
,I never been so in love
,I never been so in love
,this is to end in fire
,Then we should all burn together
,Watch the flames climb high into the night
,Calling out father, oh,
,Stand by and we will
,Watch the flames burn auburn on
,The mountain side high
,And if we should die tonight
,We should all die together
,Raise a glass of wine for the last time
,Calling out father, oh,
,Prepare as we will
,Watch the flames burn auburn on
,The mountain side
,Desolation comes upon the sky
,Now I see fire
,Inside the mountain
,I see fire
,Burning the trees
,And I see fire
,Hollowing souls
,I see fire
,Blood in the breeze
,And I hope that you remember me
,Oh, should my people fall in
,Surely I'll do the same
,Confined in mountain halls
,We got too close to the flame
,Calling out father, oh,
,Hold fast and we will
,Watch the flames burn auburn on
,The mountain side
,Desolation comes upon the sky
,Now I see fire
,Inside the mountain
,I see fire
,Burning the trees
,And I see fire
,Hollowing souls
,And I see fire
,Blood in the breeze
,And I hope that you remember me
,Now I see fire
,Inside the mountains
,I see fire
,Burning the trees
,And I see fire
,Hollowing souls
,And I see fire
,Blood in the breeze
,And I hope that you remember me
