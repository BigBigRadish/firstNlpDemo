,А мне опять твой голос чудится,
,Жизнь моя, боль моя,
,Быть может, наша встреча сбудется,
,Ведь так мала Земля.
,Мне всё дороже, всё родней
,Воспоминания далёких дней,
,И мне всё чудится, чудится
,Город прежний, тихая улица, голос нежный.
,Где нет любви, там нет надежды…
,Выходят в свет чужие повести,
,Новых дней, юных лет,
,Другая жизнь, другие скорости,
,Весна иных Джульетт.
,В мерцанье праздничных огней
,Воспоминания ещё острей,
,И мне всё чудится бережно мной хранимый,
,Кружится, кружится диск старинный
,Тобой и мной такой любимый...
,И снова мне твой голос чудится,
,Жизнь моя, боль моя,
,Едва ли наша встреча сбудется,
,Так велика Земля.
,В твоём окне зажжётся свет,
,Но этой улицы на свете нет.
,И только дальняя-дальняя
,Песня ветра
,Сердцу печальному нет ответа,
,И лишь надеждой жизнь согрета...

,За окном холода. Сейчас бы нам дернуть к морям.
,Вдруг, ты загрустила, но не от печали.
,Детка, понимаю, мне тоже так не хватало.
,Где-то там, на книжной полке, вроде завалялось малость,
,Но этого хватит, чтобы влюбиться вновь!
,Снова станет легко!
,Под утро засыпая, не встретим сказочных снов.
,Тут горы "снежных дорог" питают тающий смог.
,Ты та еще, и я тот, - и нам не важен итог!

,Куча обещаний, делился стихами, названивал днями -
,И мы - мило засыпали, укутанные мечтами.
,Но, жизнь поменяет краски. Все! И все станет напрасным,
,И твои розовые глазки вдруг, вдруг наполнятся красным.
,И наши прежние страсти под гнетом бытовых ненастий.
,Наши чувства заледенеют перейдя в имитацию счастья, но
,Нам и так хорошо.
,Наш тайный уголок украсит дрянь и порошок.
,В сердцах осталась боль. Нету места для швов.
,Разум так высоко - наркотический шок!
,Вечер сменяет ночь. Очи еле продрав,

,После же, снова стою у порога дома.
,Время, как кома. В горле комом.
,Сгорает быстро, так же, как сгорает солома.
,Лови слово налету,
,Моя муза, берегу твой приход.
,С тобой - я непобедимый музыкант.
,Мы залипали на закат.
,Годы забирали своё, но я заберу во сто крат больше.
,Прошу, залипай.
,На миноре моя суть - это просто.
,Нам бы, нам бы, нам бы вернуть эти места!
,Где души, раста? Атабаса,

,I was looking at the sky, it opened up
,Saw you coming down, like Gabriel
,And my will began, right then and there
,Not even the angels could compare

,Just you and I, lost in the moment
,You pull me close, and kiss me slow
,And everything comes into focus
,A sight of, from a telescope
,But I'm just happy to be there
,It's beautiful
,Beautiful...
,I climb up to the stars, they stand in line
,Waiting for the change to cross your mind
,Maybe I lying is this one night?
,But I see forever in your eyes

,You pull me close, and kiss me slow

, Doch vor der Warheit kann kann niemand flieh'n

Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.
My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt
So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.
I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.
Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!
Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.
Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

Hues of blues and greens surround me
Knowing you have found another love
Has turned me world to sorrow
Green with envy for another
Fearing she may be the one to soar
Through life with you, can't lose these
Hues of blues in green

作曲 : Dorham
Eu sei e voce sabe
Que o amor
Tem o seu momento
De briga e dor
Mais o que importa
e ver voce sorrir
Depois fazer as pazes
Namorar
Eu tenho um grande amor
Por ti, meu bem
Perdoa as vezes a minha insensatez
Venha, vamos andar
a beira mar, e ver!
A lua se mostrou
Eu sou so tua
Mais o que importa
E ver voce sorrir
Depois fazer as pazes
Namorar
Venha, vamos andar
a beira mar, e ver!
A lua se mostrou
Eu sou so tua
Eu sei e voce sabe
Que o amor
Tem o seu momento
De briga e dor
Mais o que importa
e ver voce sorrir
Depois fazer as pazes
Namorar
Eu tenho um grande amor
Por ti, meu bem
Perdoa as vezes a minha insensatez
Venha, vamos andar
a beira mar, e ver!
A lua se mostrou
Eu sou so tua
A lua se mostrou
Quando a noite vem...
Leva-me pra Lua
Quero ficar entre as estrelas
Deixa-me voar
Em direção a este lugar Dá-me tuas mãos Vem comigo Vem me encontrar Nesta viagem
Leva-me pra onde
O amor exista de verdade
Onde a felicidade
Só procure por nós dois Em outras palavras
Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Leva-me pra Lua Quero ficar entre as estrelas Deixa-me voar
Em direção a este lugar
Dá-me tuas mãos
Vem comigo Vem me encontrar Nesta viagem Leva-me pra onde O amor exista de verdade Onde a felicidade Só procure por nós dois Em outras palavras Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Em outras palavras Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você Fly me tô the moon, And let me play among the stars. Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand In other words, darling, kiss me Leva-me pra onde O amor exista de verdade Onde a felicidade Só procure por nós dois Em outras palavras Quero dizer Que eu vou ficar com você

,It was cold like a winter day
,You pouring November rain
,Everything felt numb
,What have we begun
,I never saw the signs how I could be so blind
,The day that I closed my eyes 'cause your heart was full of lies
,November is a nightmare that will chase me after all you've done
,I'm sorry, November, just wake me when you're gone
,Is there someone who can help me change the calendar
,Don't wanna remember, November it's me that I exist no more
,I'm sorry ...
,
,I wanted more than life
,I think of it all the time
,You were my way of light
,The guide through lonely nights
,You said you were in love
,But I guess I was not enough
,You left me in a shade
,Now my light will fade away
,November is a nightmare that will chase me after all you've done
,I'm sorry, November, just wake me when you're gone
,Is there someone who can help me change the calendar
,Don't wanna remember, November, you don't exist no more

,Sometimes I fall I slip
,My heart felt desire be more like you
,Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do
,On an island by my lonesome stranded
,Low key and stayin' candid, reflect on all the things I try my hand at
,Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
,Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
,A mountainous fontaine, spinnin' and monsoonin'
,Grinnin' it's high octane, explosive how I came
,Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hastle
,Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
,Stay afloat catch a second wind, thin is the air I breathe
,Teary eyed nose runnin', wipe the snot on my sleeve
,I'm callin' on the savior, to be all that I need
,Please forgive me, my behavior had me lost at light speed

,The fear of never falling in love
,And the tears after losing the feelings of what you thought love was
,Like the dirt still up under the rug
,My life be like bad characteristics to cover in Christ's blood
,The joy of new birth and the pain of growing up
,The bliss between giving my all and giving up
,The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
,In the cold I froze trying to ease my woes
,In this world of sin, clothes to thin to fend
,So to God I send words of help to win
,In grumblings so deep, letters could never express
,So the sound of, oh ah, beneath my breath projects
,It's times like these that make me say

,And, I believe in the kingdom coming
,I believe if you seek the truth
,You don't need to look far 'cause it's gonna find you

,Then I come open up the spot with coconut Ciroc so the hoes'll suck some cock
,Then I'll forget the call, after the nut I get attention deficit disorder
,1-5 catch us off Xes and dust

,A 20 ans toi tu rêves
,Moi la réalité ne fait pas de trêve
,Mais t'inquiète
,A Rio on ira danser

Από τη μία σαν τρελός σ' αγαπώ Κι από την άλλη ερωτηματικό που σε ρωτάει αν το θέλεις κι εσύ σαν αεροπλάνο να απογεωθούμε μαζί
Από τη μία η καρδιά μου χτυπά 
κι από την άλλη φρένο και σταματά 
γιατί το γκάζι της ζωής μου εσύ μη μου φοβάσαι, 
γκάζωσε κι όπου βγει 
Θεέ μου τι γλυκό κορίτσι είσαι εσύ 
Έχεις όσα έχουν όλες τους μαζί 
Θεέ μου τι γλυκό κορίτσι αγαπώ 
Κι απ' αγάπη τώρα θα εκραγώ 
Από τη μία αγκαλιά με κρατάς Κι από την άλλη 
σαν το κύμα χτυπάς 
Κι αναρωτιέμαι πόσα να αντέξω μποφόρ 
Αυτή η αγάπη 
έχει σπάσει ρεκόρ 
Θεέ μου τι γλυκό κορίτσι είσαι εσύ 
Έχεις όσα έχουν όλες τους μαζί 
Θεέ μου τι γλυκό κορίτσι αγαπώ Θάλασσα να ήσουν να σε πιω

,It was not long ago
,When we sat by the phone
,So many hours we wasted
,I remember when you said
,You would take me to places
,Get lost on the way back home
,We would sit by the railroad
,Watch all the trains go
,It felt like the time stood still
,There was nobody else
,Just you by my side, you by my side
,
,I wanna have you now
,Please keep loving me until the break of dawn
,Rising up, and I'll get you even higher than I am
,Bleeding hearts, so baby tell me now

,The look in your eyes
,The spark amplifies
,I wanna hold you until the last sunrise
,Lets lay on the beedsheets
,I'll listen your heartbeat
,Still feels like the time stands still

,This is gonna hurt but I blame myself first
,Cause I ignored the truth
,Drunk off that love, it fucked my head up
,There’s no forgetting you
,You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
,I was so obsessed
,Gave you all of me, and now honestly, I got nothing left
,
,I loved you dangerously
,More than the air that I breathe
,Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
,Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
,Baby, I loved you dangerously
,Mmmm, mmmm
,I loved you dangerously
,
,Usually, I hold the power
,With both my hands tied behind my back
,Look at how things changed
,Cause now you’re the train and I’m tied to the track
,You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me

,Mmmm, mmmm
,Ooh, I loved you dangerously
,Ooh ooh, I loved you dangerously
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,Yeah, Fort Minor, M. Shinoda
,Styles of Beyond, Ryu, Takbir

Love the one that's right
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your eyes
Take a look, let him in
Don't let your life go by dreamin'
'Bout some other guy when you are dancin'
With him cheek to cheek
Flying around in a jet
Champagne and limos you bet!
Laughing and having some fun
Though he's not even the one
Love the one that's right for love
Not the one you keep thinking of
Open your heart
Take a chance, let him in
Don't try to say that he's not
'Cause of all the things that he's got
For he's just a guy that wants you and he'll be true
And although he just tries to explain
That all of this fun's not a game
He'll turn around and walk out that door
Just tell him he's yours!

I can't stand still
I'm looking for something
And that something is you
You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold
But all that really matters
Are the things that we do
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
But I can't stand still
I'm so excited, I just wanna scream
I see you right before me
And it's like a real good dream
But I want you to know something, Baby
Yes, it's really true
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
I can't stand still
I'm looking for something
And that something is you
You can be my rainbow
And I'll be your pot of gold
But all that really matters
Are the things that we do
I do hope that one day
they'll be a Me & Mrs. You
Written：Harold Arlen/Ted Koehler Arranger：Nelson Riddle
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world, what a life - I'm in love.
I got a song that I sing, I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger.
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love.
Life is a beautiful thing as long as I hold the string.
I'd be a silly so-and-so if I should ever let it go.
I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger.
What a world, what a life - I'm in love.
Life is a beautiful thing as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so if I should ever let it go.
I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.
Got the string around my finger.
What a world!　Man, this is the life.
Hey, now! I'm so in love.
That's how it goes
When you feel so sad you feel so low
Life seems so bad I know, I know
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
You may think it's funny
but it always shows,
Try to hide it honey, oh no, it shows.
That's how it goes
Some people say,
Everything's gonna be okay,
Just give it a while,
You'll find you're back
Back in style
But I don't know life will get better
I am sure they know,
Sooner or later it shows, I know
That's how it goes
It's funny to see how easy life can be
Just sit back and smile
You'll find that life is worthwhile
That's how it goes
When you're on top the whole world knows
Wouldn't want to stop it, oh no, it shows
That's how it goes

,Songs Title：i get a kick out of you
,My story is much to sad to be told
,But practically everything leaves me totally cold
,The only exception I know is the case
,When Im out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
,Then I suddenly turn and see
,Your fabulous face
,I get no kick from champagne
,Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
,So tell me why should it be true
,That I get a kick out of you
,Some like the perfume from spain
,Im sure that if I took even one sniff
,It would bore me terrifically too
,But I get a kick out of you
,I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
,I get a kick though its clear to see, you obviously do not adore me
,
,I get no kick in a plane
,Flying too high with some gal in the sky
,Is my idea of nothing to do
,But I get a kick out of you
,
,
When I look into your eyes
I see sunshine
The coulds are blown away
I hope you're here to stay'
Cause I've got me needing more of you
Guess I'm falling for you
You walk away
My eyes caress you
Then you turn and smile
You've caught me thinkin' of love with you
Guess I'm falling, 
I may be falling for you
Since I met you days are brighter
Life's uneven loads are lighter
When I hear you whisper the words 
I long to hear dear
Now I look into your eyes
I'm lost in knowing that you are all 
I wantMy need for you is growing
Guess I'm falling, 
I think I'm falling for you
Think about falling for me too
,A foggy day in London Town
,I had me low and had me down
,
,I viewed the morning with such alarm
,
,The British Museum had lost its charm
,
,How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
,But the age of miracles hadn't passed,
,
,For, suddenly, I saw you there
,
,And through foggy London Town
,
,The sun was shining everywhere.

,
,
,
,Lover, when Im near you, and I hear you - speak my name
,
,Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame
,
,Lover, please be tender, when youre tender - fears depart
,
,Lover, I surrender - to my heart
I'm making this one special evening
Taking a chance in my life
Hoping you feel the same way as I do tonight
Just try and look into my eyes
Don't be scared of what you might see there
The first time I saw you
I knew love at first sight must be true, so true, oh so true
And now I just have to explain why I feel this way
I feel joy, I feel pain
You're in my heart and it's tearing me apart
'Cause I love you, I love you, I love you!
,
,
,
,
,Another night, another drink
,Another time to contemplate and think
,Will I ever, ever have anyone to love
,
,It's not that I don't try
,Maybe I try too hard
,Seems like I'm living a lie
,So there's a game I just won't learn
,And I wonder will I always be alone
,I take a sip and wonder
,Why I haven't anyone to love
,
,I guess I'll say goodnight
,My drink's done and it's morning light
,Sorry my friend but you see
,What other ending could there be
,And I wonder will I always be alone?
,I take a drink and wonder
,Will I ever have anyone to love?
,My Funny Valentines - Frank Sinatra
,My funny valentine
,sweet comic valentine
,You make me smile with my heart
,Your lips are laughable
,Unphotographable
,Yet you're my favoring work of art
,Is your figure less than Greek
,Is your mouth a little weak
,When you open it to speak
,are you smart
,But don't change a hair for me
,Not if you care for me
,stay little valentine stay
,Each day is valentine's day
,Is your mouth a little weak
,When you open it to speak
,are you smart
,But don't change a hair for me
,Not if you care for me
,stay little valentine stay
,Each day is valentine's day
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day, day and night
Why is it so that this longing for you
Follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spent my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

,The man I love
,And he'll be big and strong
,The man I love
,And when he comes my way
,I'll do my best to make him stay
,He'll look at me and smile
,I'll understand
,And in a little while
,He'll take my hand
,And though it seems absurd
,I know we both won't say a word
,Maybe I shall meet him
,Sunday, maybe Monday, maybe not
,Still I'm sure to meet him one day
,Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
,He'll build a little home
,Just meant for two
,From which I'd never roam
,Who would, would you?
,And so all else above
,I'm waiting for the man I love

, Закрой глаза, всё постепенно и тебя тут никто не заменит.
, Утро подарит нам это мгновение и холода за окном не помеха.
, Пока мы здесь в теплой постели, волосы волнами по твоей шее.
, Касания трепетны и безмятежны, мы видимо нашли,
, То что долго хотели.
, Здесь нас не найдут проблемы, только ты и я в этом мире.
, Время застынет на этом моменте, всё что имею я отдам тебе.
, Пальцы сжимаются крепко-крепко, это всё что нужно мне.
, Готов убежать за тобой на край света, чтобы
, Ещё раз по-новому всё повторить.

, Ночь с тобой - это значит, что мы не будем спать,
, Беру тебя, и профессионально иду гулять.
, Я надену свой костюм, тебе так нравится велюр,
, Ты нашла злого Юру среди самых лучших Юр.

,There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
,He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
,Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
,But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
,He could preach the bible like a preacher
,Full of ecstacy and fire
,But he also was the kind of teacher
,Women would desire
,
,Ra ra rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,There was a cat that really was gone
,Ra ra rasputin
,Russia"s greatest love machine
,It was a shame how he carried on
,He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar
,But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
,In all affairs of state he was the man to please
,But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
,For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
,Though she"d heard the things he"d done
,She believed he was a holy healer
,Who would heal her son
,Ra ra rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,There was a cat that really was gone
,Ra ra rasputin
,Russia"s greatest love machine
,It was a shame how he carried on
,But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people,
,the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder.
,"This man"s just got to go!" declared his enemies
,But the ladies begged "Don"t you try to do it, please"
,No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
,Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
,Then one night some men of higher standing
,Set a trap, they"re not to blame
,"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
,And he really came
,Ra ra rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,They put some poison into his wine
,Ra ra rasputin
,Russia"s greatest love machine
,He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
,Ra ra rasputin
,Lover of the Russian queen
,They didn"t quit, they wanted his head
,Ra ra rasputin
,Russia"s greatest love machine
,And so they shot him till he was dead
,Oh, those Russians...

,Strumming my pain with his fingers,
,Singing my life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,killing me softly with his song,
,Telling my whole life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song.
,I heard he sang a good song,
,I heard he had a style,
,And so I came to see him and listen for a while.
,And there he was this young boy,
,a stranger to my eyes,
,Strumming my pain with his fingers,
,Singing my life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Telling my whole life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song.
,I felt all flushed with fever,
,Embarrassed by the crowd,
,I felt he found my letters and read each word out loud.
,I prayed that he would finish,
,But he just kept right on
,Strumming my pain with his fingers,
,Singing my life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Telling my whole life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song
,He said as if he knew me
,In all my god's spaer
,And then he looked right through me
,as if I wasn't there.
,And he just kept on singing
,singing clear and strong
,Strumming my pain with his fingers,
,Singing my life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Telling my whole life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song.
,Oh,oh......

,he was strumming my pain
,he was singing my life
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Killing me softly with his song,
,Telling my whole life with his words,
,Killing me softly with his song.
I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new - yeah yeah

I loved you with the fire red-
Now it's turning blue, and you say...
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid...

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late whoa.....

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway

Stay with me, sway with me

,end
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,Fly Me To The Moon
,Let me play among the stars
,Let me see what spring is like
,On Jupiter and Mars
,In other words hold my hand
,In other words baby kiss me
,Fill my heart with song
,Let me sing for ever more
,You are all I long for
,All I worship and adore
,In other words please be true
,In other words I love you
,
,Fill my heart with song
,Let me sing for ever more

,I want to be a part of it - New York, New York
,Your vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray
,And stay around the heart of it - New York, New York
,I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
,And find your king of the hill - top of the heap
,You're small town blues, they are melting away
,I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York
,You always make it there, you make it anywhere

,You make me feel so young
,You make me feel as spring has sprung
,And every time I see you grin
,I'm such a happy individual
,The moment that you speak
,I want to go and play hide-and-seek
,I want to go and bounce the moon
,Just like a toy balloon
,You and I, are just like a couple of tots
,Running across the meadow
,Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
,You make me feel so young
,You make me feel there are songs to be sung
,Bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung
,And even when I'm old and gray
,I'm gonna feel the way I do today
,'Cause you make me feel so young
,You make me young
,You make me feel that the spring sparkls
,Every time I see you grin
,I such a happy
,Individual in the moment that you speak
,I wanna go play highs in the seak
,I wanna go and buts at the moon
,Like blow a big baloon
,Because you and I are just like a couple of cats
,Running cross the middle
,across the meadow
,You make me young
,You make me feel there are songs to be sung
,Bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung
,And even when I'm old and gray

,Cause you make me feel so
,Man I just be so
,You make me feel so young
,Yeah make me feel so young, babe
,You make me feel so young
,You make me feel so young
You keep pouring into one glass
And you're never changing the straw
And now to sing this lovely ballad
Here is, Mama Cass
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say, "Nighty-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone, blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

歌词含义：爱情，给我们感动，甜蜜和幸福，同样地也会给我们带来伤痛.心碎和泪水。可是爱一个人，不一定要得到他；爱一个人也不一定要占有他。有时放弃也是一种美丽.，虽然这种美丽会带来心碎，会伴随着无奈．但在爱情中，结果有甜蜜，也有苦涩。无论结果如何，假如我们真的彼此相爱过，就应该彼此祝福对方会过更好！！！

歌词含义：天空落雨，也许你不知道天在思念大地，狂风卷沙，也许你不知道风在思念沙粒，砂锅煮鱼，也许你不知道水在思念鲤鱼。渔翁钓的是寂寞，上钩的却是鱼。为什么？因为我要你知道我在想你

我曾深深爱过你	
也曾试着去忘记	
你给我带来的那些	
无奈的过去	
男人醉了很脆弱	
如果酒是你的错	
无力的脚步	
让我向痛的深处坠落	
你说你会爱着我	
这句话让我好寂寞	
你的心蕴藏着多少	
我不懂的结果	
你说你会爱着我	
这句话让我好难过	
看着我的憔悴	
你怎么就会舍得

,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in
,I wonder as I listen to the wind blow.
,People walk past in the streets.
,A city that I will never meet.
,People in their cars and their cars in the streets,
,the streets in the city where I sleep.
,Walk down to the supermarket.
,Milk and bread in my basket.
,Chocolate on the shelf and my mind on the docket,
,I'm a slave to the change that's in my pocket.
,Planes draw lines in the skies.
,Beautiful people fill my eyes.
,Drawing lines now to my own conclusions,
,beauty is desire in disguise.
,The morning leads me over to my window.
,The air feels sharp against my skin.
,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in

,What if you talked 'til it was time to go?
,He said, "See you around"

,The sun has left and forgotten me
,It's dark, I cannot see
,Why does this rain pour down?
,I'm gonna drown
,In a sea...of deep confusion
,Somebody told me - I don't know who
,Whenever you are sad and blue
,And you're feejin' all alone and left behind
,Just take a look inside and you will find
,You gotta hold on, hold on through the night
,Hang on, things will be all right
,Even when it's dark
,And not a bit of sparkling
,Sing-song sunshine from above
,Spreading rays of sunny love - just
,Hang on, hang on to the vine
,Stay on, soon you'll be divine
,If you start to cry, look up to the sky
,Something's coming up ahead
,To turn your tears to dew instead
,And so I hold on to this advice
,When change is hard and not so nice
,If you listen to your heart the whole night through
,Your sunny somedav will come one dav soon to you
,I will follow the sound of the owl
,bless this house
,bless my pillow
,bless your pillow

,Heavy rain fallin'
,seems I hear your voice callin' It's all right.
,It’s a  rainy night in Georgia
,a rainy night in Georgia
,Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
,I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
,Neon signs a-flashin'
,taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
,A distant moanin' of a train
,it's seems to play a sad refrain to the night
,It’s a  rainy night in Georgia
,such a rainy night in Georgia
,Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
,I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
,How many times i wondered
,It still comes out the same
,No matter how you look at it or think of it
,It's life and you just got to play the game
,I find me a place in a box car
,so I take my guitar to pass some time
,But late at night when it's hard to rest
,I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine
,But it's a rainy night in Georgia,
,baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia
,Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
,I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Moon River, wider than a mile: 
I'm crossin' you in style someday. 
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker, 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin'your way. 
Two drifters, off to see the world. 
There's such a lot of world to see. 
We're after the same rainbow's end, 
Waitin' round the bend, 
My huckleberry friend, 
Moon River and me. 

My romance, doesn't need to have a moon in the sky
My romance, doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitar
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
All at once I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
And wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you, but you

,And now the end is near
,So I face the final curtain
,My friend, I'll say it clear
,I'll state my case of which I'm certain
,I've lived a life that's full
,I've traveled each and every highway
,And more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Regrets, I've had a few
,But then again, too few to mention
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption
,I planned each charted course
,Each careful step along the byway
,Oh, and more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew
,But through it all, when there was doubt
,I ate it up and spit it out
,I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried
,I've had my fill, my share of losing
,And now as tears subside
,I find it all so amusing
,To think I did all that
,And may I say, not in a shy way
,"Oh, no, no not me. I did it my way"
,For what is a man, what has he got
,If not himself, then he has naught
,To say the things he truly feels
,And not the words of one who kneels
,The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
,My way
,My way
,
,Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
,Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
,Georgia, Georgia, a song of you
,Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines
,Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
,Still in peaceful dreams I see the roads leads back to you
,Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find
,Just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind
,Other arms reach out to me, other eyes smile tenderly
,Still in peaceful dreams I see the roads leads back to you
,Georgia, Georgia, no peace I find

,When the sun is high
,in the afternoon sky
,You can always
,find something to do;
,But from dusk til dawn,
,as the clock ticks on,
,Something happens to you.
,In the wee small hours
,of the morning
,While the whole wide
,world is fast asleep
,You lie awake and
,think about the girl
,And never ever think
,of counting sheep
,When your lonely heart
,has learned its lesson
,You'd be hers
,if only she would call
,In the wee small
,hours of the morning
,That's the time
,you miss her most of all
,When your lonely heart
,has learned its lesson
,You'd be hers
,if only she would call
,In the wee small
,hours of the morning
,That's the time
,you miss her most of all

,I think about that day
,I left him at a Greyhound station
,West of Santa Fé
,
,We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
,Still I did what I had to do
,'Cause I just knew
,
,Summer: Sunday nights
,We'd sink into our seats
,Right as they dimmed out all the lights
,A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
,It called me to be on that screen
,And live inside each scene
,
,Without a nickel to my name
,Hopped a bus, here I came
,Could be brave or just insane
,
,We'll have to see
,
,'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
,He'll sit one day, the lights are down
,He'll see my face and think of how he...
,...used to know me
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,I hear 'em ev'ry day
,The rhythms in the canyons
,That'll never fade away
,The ballads in the barrooms
,Left by those who came before
,They say "you gotta want it more"
,So I bang on ev'ry door
,
,And even when the answer's "no"
,Or when my money's running low
,The dusty mic and neon glow
,Are all I need
,
,And someday as I sing my song
,A small-town kid'll come along
,
,That'll be the thing to push him on and go go
,
,Climb these hills
,I'm reaching for the heights
,And chasing all the lights that shine
,And when they let you down
,You'll get up off the ground
,'Cause morning rolls around
,And it's another day of sun
,
,And when they let you down
,The morning rolls around
,
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Just another day of sun
,It's another day of sun
,Another day has just begun
,It's another day of sun

Lara Fabian - Tango
Paroles: Lara Fabian
Musique: Rick Allison

Mais qu'est ce que je fous là
Je sombre au fond de toi
Quelle heure est t-il et quel feu me noie
Fait-il noir ou clair, je n'sais pas
Ma peau se colle au rouge de ton sang qui bouge
Et qui coule vers moi
Je danse et je me bats

Et j'enroule mes chevilles autour de toi
Mes jambes se plient
Je contourne tes hanches
Sur mes reins se joue ta revanche
Je prie en vain mais toi tu rie, une soif s'assouvit
Je danse ou je me bats
Je n'sais pas, je n'sais pas
Tango mi amor
Tu me fais mal et mon sort
Est le bien qui me dévore
Quand mon corps se tord
Tango mi amor
Animal ou matador
L'un de nous deux est le plus fort
Quand mon corps se tord

Mais le doute s'installe
Je me sens comme en cavale
La vie me pousse dans la course
Mon corps qui te repousse
Tes gestes me rappellent que tu n'as pas sur moi
Le droit que je te dois, je danse et je me bats
Mais comment dire à qui, à quoi, à qui je suis
Quand de n'appartenir qu'à toi est le défi
Et si je te disais qu'il n'y a pas que toi
Je danse et tu te bats
Je danse et tu te bats
Tango mi amor
Tu me fais mal et mon sort
Est le bien qui me dévore
Quand mon corps se tord
Tango mi amor
Animal ou matador
L'un de nous deux est le plus fort
Tango mi amor

Tango mon corps
Ne t'appartient pas encore
Et si mon ame s'en sort
Mon corps, lui, se tord

FIN
 
Vuelvo al Sur
Como se vuelve siempre al amor
Vuelvo a vos
Con mi deseo, con mi temor
Llevo el Sur
Como un destino del corazon
Soy del Sur
Como los aires del bandoneon
Sueño el Sur
Inmensa luna, cielo al revés
Busco el Sur
El tiempo abierto y su después
Quiero al Sur
Su buena gente, su dignidad
Siento el Sur
Como tu cuerpo en la intimidad
(Merci à Isabelle pour cettes paroles)

,She said I am the one will dance on the floor in the round
,She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
,Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

,And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
,And mother always told me be careful of who you love
,And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

,She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
,But the kid is not my son

,The law was on her side
,But who can stand when she's in demand
,Her schemes and plans

,What should I call this happy madness that I feel inside of me
,Some kind of wild October gladness that I never thought I'd see
,What has become of all my sadness all my endless lonely sighs
,Where are my sorrows now
,What happened to the frown and is that self contented clown
,Standing grinning in the mirror really me
,I'd like to run through Central Park carve your initials in the bark
,of every tree I pass for every one to see
,I feel that I've gone back to childhood and I'm skipping through the wild wood
,So excited that I don't know what to do
,What do I care if I'm a juvenile I smile my secret little smile
,Because I know the change in me is you
,What should I call this happy madness all this unexpected joy
,That turned the world into a baby's bouncing toy
,The god's are laughing far above One of them gave a little shove
,And I fell gaily gladly madly into love
,i'm sittin' in the window of a street cafe
,watchin' you walking by each day
,it seems that you always wanna look my way
,hey, you can't deny, boy
,you're such a shy boy
,so good looking you seem to be
,but you're too tongue-tied to say hi to me
,you could make it happen so easily
,woah, i'll tell you why boy
,'cos i'm looking for a shy boy
,most guys advertise
,by making eyes and telling lies
,if you only knew
,you could make your dreams come true
,all you gotta do is ask me to
,if this was a quiz on a tv show
,and the prize was a guy who would love me so
,whatever they ask, the answer i know
,hey, my reply boy
,is gimme a shy boy

,Mon nom ne vous dit rien
,Vous devez ignorer
,Que nous sommes voisins
,Depuis le mois de mai
,Mes cheveux sont chatains
,Mon air est détaché
,Vous sentez mon parfum
,Tous les soirs sur le palier
,Je vous ai apercu
,Salle des pas perdus
,Un soir, était-ce à St Lazare ?
,Avec une inconnue
,Coiffée d'un fichu, jacquard
,Vous portiez sa guitare
,
,Si j'ose néanmoins,
,Vous écrire ce billet
,C'est pour tenez vous bien
,C'est pour vous déclarer
,Ma flamme et mon chagrin
,Mais aussi mes regrets
,De ne vous avoir pas
,Suivi sur le quai
,Et de n'avoir pas su
,Salle des pas perdus
,Vous dire quel était mon désir c'est bizarre
,Je serais à la terrasse
,Du café d'en face
,Ce soir à dix heures moins le quart
,
,Bien à vous

,
,And those of us with ravaged faces
,Lacking in the social graces
,Desperately remained at home
,Inventing lovers on the phone
,Who called to say "come dance with me"
,And murmured vague obscenities
,It isn't all it seems at seventeen
,I learned the truth at seventeen
,That love was meant for beauty queens
,And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
,Who married young and then retired
,The valentines I never knew
,The Friday night charades of youth
,Were spent on one more beautiful
,At seventeen I learned the truth
,A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
,Whose name I never could pronounce
,Said: "Pity please the ones who serve
,They only get what they deserve"
,The rich relationed hometown queen
,Marries into what she needs
,With a guarantee of company
,And haven for the elderly
,So remember those who win the game
,Lose the love they sought to gain
,In debitures of quality and dubious integrity
,Their small-town eyes will gape at you
,In dull surprise when payment due
,Exceeds accounts received at seventeen
,To those of us who knew the pain
,Of valentines that never came
,And those whose names were never called
,When choosing sides for basketball
,It was long ago and far away
,the world was younger than today
,when dreams were all they gave for free
,to ugly duckling girls like me
,We all play the game, and when we dare
,We cheat ourselves at solitaire
,Repenting other lives unknown
,That call and say: "Come on, dance with me"
,And murmur vague obscenities
,At ugly girls like me,at seventeen
,
, At last my love has come along
, My lonely days are over
, And life is like a song
, Yeah
, At last the sky above is blue
, My heart was wrapped in clover
, The night I looked at you
, I found a dream that I could speak to
, A dream to call my own
, I found the thrill to press my cheek to
, A thrill I never known
, But you smiled
, You smiled and then the spell was cast
, And here we are in heaven
, For you are mine at last
, For you are mine at last
, I found a dream that I could speak to
, A dream to call my own
, I found a thrill to press my cheek to
, A thrill I never known
, But you smiled
, You smiled and then the spell was cast
, And here we are in heaven
, For you are mine at last
﻿Quiet nights of quiet stars 
quiet cords from my guitar 
floating on the silence that surrounds us 
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams 
quiet walks by quiet streams 
and the window looking on the mountains 
and the sea how lovely 
this is where i want to be 
here with you so close to me 
Until the final flicker of life's ember 
I who was lost and lonely 
believing life was only 
a bitter tragic joke 
have found with you 
the meaning of existence 
oh my love

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field

,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world

,My flesh is searchin' for your worst and best, don't ever deny
,I'm like a stranger, gimme me danger
,All your wrongs and your rights
,Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes
,Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine
,But you don't even know
,I can make your hands clap
,Said I can make your hands clap

,Am I the only living soul around?

,That I can make your hands clap
,That I can make your hands clap
,That I can make your hands clap

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,We were sipping whisky neat
,Highest floor, the bowery
,Nowhere's high enough
,
,Somewhere along the lines
,We stopped seeing eye to eye
,You were staying out all night
,And I had enough
,
,No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're going
,But I know I won't be home
,And you'll be on your own
,
,Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
,Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
,Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?

,Summer nights and the liberties
,Never growing up

,I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
,But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us

,Ashes in your hands
,Mercy in your eyes
,If you're searching for a silent sky...
,You won't find it here
,Look another way
,You won't find it here
,So die another day
,
,The coldness of his words
,The message in his silence,
,"Face the candle to the wind..

,Isn't leaving you a choice
,So if you're looking for a time to run away...
,You won't find it here

,So try another day

,They took pictures of our dreams
,Ran to hide behind the stairs
,And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall
,But if they don't come down
,Resist the need to pull them in
,And throw them away
,Better to save the mystery
,Than surrender to the secret

,我昨天夜里做了一个梦，
,梦到我一个人去百乐门玩
,（民国时期上海著名的歌舞厅），
,梦里面是晚上，人超级多，马路上车子也没地方停。
,百乐门门口的小姑娘都穿件长旗袍，
,长得都很漂亮哦~
,进去里面还有爵士乐队，
,跳舞场里全是人，热闹得不得了~
,我一直在里面找你，就是找不到，急死我了！
,最后只好跑出来给你打个电话，
,通是通了，你就是爱理不理，
,一句话也不说，不知道你在想什么东西！
,我吃不准你到底什么意思，只好挂掉咯，气死我了！
,I slip into my best dress
,I'm gonna go out tonight
,Expecting to get loose now
,And I hope you don't put up a fight
,Remember that you only live one time
,You gotta get crazy if you're gonna be mine
,
,Gonna be mine
,Gonna be mine
,Gonna be mine

,
,If you're never weird in some way
,Then you're not entertaining
,And if you're never crazy
,That's a shame, you're a little lazy
,If you never surprise me
,You're not entertaining
,You never laugh at yourself
,You just do too much complaining

,Oh, remember that you only live one time
,You gotta get crazy if you're gonna be mine
,Surprise and entertain me, is that too much to ask?
,
,Now put a little swing to it
,Put a little back into it
,Open up your mind and do it
,Is that too much to ask?
,I don't care if you ain't got money
,I don't care if you're a little bit funny
,Is that too much, is that too much to ask?
,You better know by know she said
,I made no effort to defend myself against her claim
,There wasn't anything to add, and so I blurted out
,I guess it's gonna rain today
,What a silly thing to put you through, I know better
,Lost for words because I'm losing you
,Didn't I promise you I knew better?
,
,Hurry home before the sky breaks out
,You can't predict things that happen all the time

,She said to get the hell away
,And left me standing in the doorway like a tired cliche
,I thought I had it all pinned down, now I'm the guy who said
,I guess it's gonna rain today
,Oh, the fine line between street-smartness and a smart ass
,Oh, the skipping beats of confidence
,And the drumroll that you thought you could play

,
,But I'm sure that you've known this all along
,Oh, I'm sure that you've known this all along
,
,The day you lie next to me,butterflies in the sky
,the other day I hate you more than ever
,you are the one,you're nobody,you're everything I care,
,but I don't know if I'll love you forever.
,Oh what crazy things I say
,I always knew we're meant to be together,
,but oh my something keeps saying no
,and in the end I'll say "Goodbye My Lover".
,
,Sitting here,I'm all alone,I'm smoking in the dark
,keep wondering "Hey baby should I have left you?"
,if I believed in fairy tales then surely I would know
,that all my dreams came true the day I met you.
,Oh what crazy things I say,
,I always knew there would be no tomorrow
,and oh my everything has stopped
,and in the end my heart is full of sorrow.

,a memory from your lonesome past
,keeps us so far apart
,why can't i free your doubtful mind
,and melt your cold cold heart
,
,another love before my time

,One flight down
,There's a song on low
,And your mind just picked up on the sound
,Now you know you're wrong
,Because it drifts like smoke
,And it's been there playing all along
,Now you know
,Now you know

,In this place
,Where your arms unfold
,Here at last you see your ancient face

,There's a song on low
,And it's been there playing all along
,Now you know
,Now you know
,Lines on your face don't bother me
,Down in my chair when you dance over me
,I can't help myself
,I've got to see you again
,
,Late in the night when I'm all alone
,And I look at the clock
,And I know you're not home
,I can't help myself
,
,I've got to see you again
,I could almost go there
,Just to watch you be seen
,I could almost go there
,Just to live in a dream

,But no I won't go for any of those things
,To not touch your skin is not why I sing

,All the voices that are spinnin' around me
,Trying to tell me what to say
,Can I fly right behind you
,And you can take me away

,Lonestar where are you out tonight
,This feeling I'm trying to fight
,It's dark and I think that I would give anything
,For you to shine down on me
,How far you are I just don't know
,The distance I'm willing to go
,I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky
,Hoping for some kind of sign
,Lonestar where are you out tonight
,This feeling I'm trying to fight
,It's dark and I think that I would give anything
,For you to shine down on me
,For you to shine down on me
,Yesterday I saw the sun shinin'
,And the leaves were fallin' down softly
,My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
,And I was thinkin' about you
,
,Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving
,You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
,I guess it's time for me to let you go
,And I've been thinkin' about you
,I've been thinkin' about you
,
,When you sail across the ocean waters
,And you reach the other side safely
,Could you smile a little smile for me?
,'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you
,
,I'll be thinkin' about you
,I'll be thinkin' about you
,I'll be thinkin' about you
,
,
,Sunrise sunrise
,Looks like morning in your eyes
,But the clocks had nine fifteen for hours
,
,Sunrise sunrise
,Couldn't tempt us if it tried
,Cause the afternoon's already come and gone
,And I said
,hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
,Do you
,
,Surprise surprise
,Couldn't find it in your eyes
,But I'm sure it's written all over my face
,
,Surprise surprise
,Never something I could hide
,When I see we've made through another day
,Then I say
,hooohoo hooohooo hooohooo
,Do you
,
,Now the night
,throw its cover down
,mmm on me again
,Ooo and if I'm right
,It's the only way to bring me back
,Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
,Do you

,This song is for the one that I love
,Come away with me in the night
,Come away with me
,And I will write you a song
,Come away with me on a bus
,Come away where they can't tempt us
,With their lies
,And I want to walk with you
,On a cloudy day
,In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
,So won't you try to come
,Come away with me and we'll kiss
,On a mountaintop
,Come away with me
,And I'll never stop loving you
,And I want to wake up with the rain
,Falling on a tin roof
,While I'm safe there in your arms
,So all I ask is for you
,To come away with me in the night
,Come away with me
,
,You keep digging pushing driving like a hammer hitting in my head space
,If this is a condition is sadistic I would say it is the worst case
,It's just another fight, never you, never me, never right
,Nothing hurts like this
,Feels as good as your kiss
,When I strip 'em down with you, youu uh uh uh
,I feel this love is barrow through another level, never was perfection
,Say what you know, how to know the keys that crushed me for attention
,Just another fight, never you, never me, never right
,Nothing hurts like this
,Feels as good as your kiss
,When I strip 'em down with you, youu uh uh uh
,With you-uh, you-uuh uh
,It's always you-uh, you-uuh uh

,雨下过后的屋檐，猫坐在路边，
,你吹着风，不说话就很甜。
,微光里树影重叠，骤雨间湿冷麻雀，
,我杜撰许多离别，勇敢而坚决！
,十月过后的天空，醉酒般晕红，
,一半是春夏，一半是秋冬。
,光影飘浮过山峰，留下关于你的梦，
,我在这写下重逢，贫乏而心动！
,想和你看着星空，只谈夜色与微风，
,不关心明天，不在乎所有，
,只对你有独钟。
,是时候和你决定，即便匆忙去远行，
,在山野间追风，去看遍世界，
,黄昏与黎明。
,
,路过转角的花店，你坐在窗前，
,我骑着单车，载着你走很远。
,星光透映着长街，无意间夜色倾斜。
,在纸上写下一页，深沉而浓烈！
,想和你看着星空，只谈夜色与微风，
,不关心明天，不在乎所有，
,只对你有独钟。
,是时候和你决定，即便匆忙去远行，
,在山野间追风，去看遍世界，
,黄昏与黎明.
,
,任时间过往匆匆，轻易就远去无声，
,在人潮之中，想要拥抱你，哪怕片刻永恒，
,我已经偷偷决定，把爱你的事澄清，
,在百念之中，你依然是我，未寻得的旧梦。
,
,十月过后的天空，光影在流动。
,一半是春夏，一半是秋冬。

,
,Hello, it's me
,I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
,To go over everything
,They say that time's supposed to heal ya
,But I ain't done much healing
,Hello, can you hear me
,I'm just at house dreaming about who we used to be
,When we were younger and free
,I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
,There's such a difference between us
,And a million miles
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For everything that I've done
,But when I call you never seem to be home
,Hello from the outside
,At least I can say that I've tried
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
,Hello, how are you
,It's so typical of me to talk about myself
,I'm sorry
,I hope that you're well
,Where nothing ever happened
,It's no secret
,That the both of us are running out of time
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For everything that I've done
,But when I call you never seem to be home
,Hello from the outside
,At least I can say that I've tried
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
,What would you do
,If you was me I was you
,Would you move on
,Go and find someone new
,I know it hurts
,But believe me I'm hurting too
,I guess I can't
,Hide it as well as you
,With luck
,I woke up next to the baddest  bitch I've ever seen
,But even then all I can think of was you and me
,My friends tell me
,"Hey Anth homie just let it be"
,Unless they've been through it
,They don't know what the fuck I mean
,So please girl tell me what do I do
,Cause I know that nobody is perfect
,But I'm perfect for you
,And girl you are perfect for me
,That's something you couldn't see
,I try to show you
,But what was the point if you don't believe
,Now tell me why did you leave
,Do you not love me no more
,See I can't hide all the pain
,But what remains is the scars
,I was the best I could be
,I know that I have my flaws
,But I give all that I have
,Spend more than I could afford
,I spend five thousand dollars on the ring to call you my Mrs
,And you still have the nerve to say I gave no commitment
,There was no way that I could save ya
,Three years is what I gave ya
,And then you leave me and go find a new man three weeks later
,My sister thinks you cheated and honestly I don't blame her
,Cause moving on that quick is way too strange of a behaviour
,And now my daddy's happy cause he sees you posting pictures
,But dawg I bet my life she thinks about me when you're with her
,He don't want you like I want you
,He don't need you like I need you
,He don't see you how I see you
,He don't breathe you how I breathe you
,And you know it
,So tell me what the fuck you see in him
,We both know that you still love me
,So you shouldn't be with him
,You should be with me
,Right here in my home ,right here all alone
,Making love until the moon
,You love how I turn you on
,And one thing that I love and hate the most
,Is people always change but the memories don't
,And lately I can even eat
,Lately I've been feeling ill
,When you can not sleep at night
,That's when you know shit is real
,You don't even need a gun
,You don't even need a pill
,If you ever wanna die
,Fall in love and you'll get killed
,Hello from the other side
,I must've called a thousand times
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For everything that I've done
,But when I call you never seem to be home
,Hello from the outside
,At least I can say that I've tried
,To tell you I'm sorry
,For breaking your heart
,But it don't matter
,It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
A felicidade é como a gota
De orvalho numa pétala de flor
Brilha tranquila
Depois de leve oscila
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A felicidade do pobre parece
A grande ilusão do carnaval
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho
Pra fazer a fantasia
De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira
Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
A felicidade é como a pluma
Que o vento vai levando pelo ar
Voa tão leve
Mas tem a vida breve
Precisa que haja vento sem parar
A minha felicidade está sonhando
Nos olhos da minha namoradaÉ como esta noite
Passando, passando
Em busca da madrugada
Falem baixo, por favor
Prá que ela acorde alegre como o dia
Oferecendo beijos de amor
Tristeza não tem fim
Felicidade sim
Dans un grand jardin enchanté
Tout à coup je me suis retrouvée
Une harpe des violons jouaient
Des anges au ciel me souriaient
Le vent faisait chanter l’été
Je marchais d’un pas si léger
Sur un tapis aux pétales de roses
Une colombe sur mon épaule
Dans chaque main une hirondelle
Des papillons couleurs pastel
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Mais si beau qu’il était vrai
Comme un jour qui se lève
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Un sourire sur mes lèvres
Un sourire que j’ai gardé
Au-delà de mon rêve
Le soleil et ses rayons d’or
Les fleurs dansaient sur un même accord
Des chevaux blancs avec des ailes
Semblaient vouloir toucher le ciel
Vraiment j’étais au pays des fées
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Mais si beau qu’il était vrai
Comme un jour qui se lève
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Un sourire sur mes lèvres
Un sourire que j’ai gardé
Au-delà de mon rêve
Ce n’était qu’un rêve
Fin
Cada Palmeira na estrada
Tem uma moça recostada
Uma é minha namorada
E essa estrada vai dar no mar
Cada palma enluarada
Tem que estar quieta, parada
Qualquer canção, quase nada
Vai fazer o dia nascer
Vai fazer o sol levantar
Namorando a madrugada
Eu e minha namorada
Vamos andando na estrada
Que vai dar no avarandado do amanhecer
No avarandado do amanhecer
No avarandado do amanhecer.
Vai minha tristeza 
E diz a ela que 
Sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece 
Que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade
A realidade é que 
Sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza
É só tristeza e a melancolia 
Nue não sai de mim
Não sai de mim
Não sai
Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar 
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca
Dentro dos meus braços os abraços 
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim 
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é prá acabar 
Com esse negócio 
de viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio de você viver sem mim
,
,Chéri,vois-tu je t'aime
,Et dans tes bras je vis un rêve enchanté
,Pourdant j'ai peur quand même
, à la pensée que tu pourrais me quitter
,Sans savoir ce que sera demain
,Ma vie est entre tes mains
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Après toi mon coeur sera fermé pour toujours
,Ici-bas rien ne m'attire que ton sourire
,Ici-bas rien ne m'émeut que tes grands yeux si bleus
,Tout en moi t'appartient sans retour
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Offrir de la tendresse
,Et des baisers qui sans amour ne sont rien
,Gouter d'autres ivresses
,Entre des bras qui me seraient pas les tiens
,Dire encore des mots tendres tout bas
,Non,je ne le pourrais pas
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Après toi mon coeur sera fermé pour toujours
,Ici-bas rien ne m'attire que ton sourire
,Ici-bas rien ne m'émeut que tes grands yeux si bleus
,Tout en moi t'appartient sans retour
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour
,Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour

Lindo capullo de aleli
Si tú supieras mi dolor
Correspondieras a mi amor
Y calmaras mi sufrir
Porque tú sabes que sin tí
La vida es nada para mí
Tú bien lo sabes
Capullito de aleli
No hay en el mundo para mí
Otro capullo de alelí
Que yo le brinde mi pasión
Y que le dé mi corazón
Porque tú eres la mujer
A quien he dado mi querer
Y te juré lindo alelí
Fidelidad hasta morir
Por eso yo te canto a tí
Mi capullito de alelí
Dame tu aroma seductor
Y un poquito de tu amor
Porque tú sabes que sin tí
La vida es nada para mí
Tú bien lo sabes
Capullito de alelí

Quelques fois je dis des mots bizarres
Quelques fois je parle trop
Et tu me regardes et mon coeur tombe a l'eau
Sometimes I say strange words 
Sometimes I speak too much 
And you look at me and my heart falls into the water
Quelques fois je ris a contretemps
Tu n'y comprends rien de tout
Et tu me regardes etonne tout a coup
Sometimes I laugh at the wrong moment 
You don't understand a thing about it 
And you look at me suddenly surprised
Ne te pose pas trop de questions
La reponse est dans mes yeux
Elle est quelque part au milieu de nous deux
Don't ask yourself too many questions 
The answer is in my eyes 
It is somewhere in between us
Ne m'oublige-je pas a tout te dire
Puisque tu le sais deja
Tout ce que je fais aujourd'hui, , , c'est pour toi
Don't force me to tell you everything 
Since you already know it 
All I do today, , , it's for you
C'est pour toi toi que j'aime encore
C'est pour toi que je suis la
C'est pour toi toi que j'ouvrais mes bras
C'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se melangent tout le temps
C'est pour toi aussi que j'aime les enfants
It's for you that I still love 
It's for you that I am here 
It's for you you that I was opening my arms 
It's for you you that red and white mix all the time 
It's for you also that I love children
Je ne trouve rien de cette fille que j'etais hier encore
Ta presence en moi reveille l'eau qui dort
Je ne connais pas ce que je suis
Je suis quelqu'un de nouveau
Quelqu'un de plus beau et peut-etre plus fort
I don't find anything of that girl I still was yesterday 
Your presence in me awakes the dormant water 
I don't know what I am 
I am someone new 
Someone more beautiful and maybe stronger
C'est pour toi toi que j'aime encore
C'est pour toi que je suis la
C'est pour toi toi que j'ouvrais mes bras
C'est pour toi toi que rouge et blanc se melangent tout le temps
C'est pour toi aussi que j'aime les enfants

Ansiedad
De tenerte en mis brazos
Musitando palabras de amor... 
Ansiedad
De tener tus encantos
En la boca volverte a besar... 

Tal vez está llorando mi pensamiento
Mis lágrimas son perlas que caen al mar
El eco adormecido de este lamento
Hace que estés presente en mi soñar
Quizás estés llorando al recordarme
Y estreches mi retrato con frenesí

Hasta tu oído llegue la melodía salvaje
Del eco de la pena de estar sin ti...

My Dream Sonata
My dream sonata is the music 
I hearEach night when all the world is deep in slumber,
And in my dreams you suddenly appear
While the music’s playing 
I hear you say,“
I love you, 
I love you.”**
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer,
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music,
That when 
I wake, my darling, you’ll be there.
But when I awaken, you’re gone, it seems.
Like my sonata, you all only in my dreams.(Pick up at **.)

,I'll move on I'll go on. Lord I will take your hand.
,And you will guide me along. Survive thru' this storm.
,So I say, come what may. I'll hold on to my hope.
,Yes, I will walk down this road.
,And my passion drive will lead me on.
,Here I am Once again Caught in the rain.
,Looking back I've come sofar And I want to carry on
,Take a step A little time It's alright.
,Even thru' this rain, I want to smile again
,Don't hold back now. And i've been thru' this before.
,Now where am I? Where do I stand? A little lost here.
,But I'll remember. All those times you've bought me thru'.
,I can feel the sun shining down on me
,Here I am, Here I am. Lord I will take your hand.
,And you will guide me along. Survive thru' this storm.

,But you’re not lookin’ my way
,Like you trying to act cool
,I think I lost my mind
,Back there and then
,Oh how I let my feelings go
,
,You see, I know it’s just a crush
,And a crush won’t ever last long
,No one’s forcing it, boy
,So you I’ll put aside
,Thought friends we would be
,Oh, boy…

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway

Hold me close, sway me more

Stay with me, sway with me

Sway me smooth, sway me now

,I longed for you since I was born
,A man so sensitive and warm
,And there you were
,With pride and strength no one would test
,But yet have lastly been feminine
,And so much more
,You took me riding in your rocket you gave me a star
,But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
,Down to this cold, cold world
,You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
,At a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
,Down to this cold, cold world
,Dressed like a Shakespeare of your time
,With looks to blow Picasso's mind
,You were the best
,Your body moved with grace and song
,Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
,Nevertheless, oh oh
,Oh You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
,But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
,Down to this cold, cold world
,Ooh you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star
,At a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
,Down to this cold, cold world
,Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do, Do Do Do
,Do Do Do, Do Do Do
,The passion burning in your heart
,Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
,Where did it go
,Just why that you would overnight
,Turn love to stone as cold as ice
,I'll never never know
,Baby you took me riding in your rocket and gave me a star
,Oh you dropped me back
,To this cold, cold world
,Baby you dropped me back

,I felt it in my heart, that it was time, a change of scenery
,To get a little lost, to feel alive, and reach beyond me
,I walked into the first café in France I’m so cliché...
,When I saw him I felt the room divide into pieces
,Oh the lights danced around us just like stars in the sky
,One night in Paris with a man I barely knew, I’m lost in a moment
,C’est La vie, C’est La chance, C’est L’amour
,It happened all too fast, the perfect night, for perfect strangers
,The way he wrapped the curls of his mustache around his fingers
,And like a little girl who’s never been to Disneyland...
,When I saw him I felt the room divide into pieces
,Oh the lights danced around us just like stars in the sky
,One night in Paris with a man I barely knew, I’m lost in a moment
,C’est La vie, C’est La chance, C’est L’amour
,And when I think I about him, I wish I had it all, to do again because….
,I Wanna be just like Mary so let them eat their cake
,When I saw him I felt the room divide into pieces
,Oh the lights danced around us just like stars in the sky
,One night in Paris with a man I barely knew, I’m lost in a moment
,C’est La vie, C’est La chance, C’est L’amour
,ba ba la ...
,C’est La vie, C’est La chance, C’est L’amour...
,Ma l’amore, no.
,L’amore mio non può
,disperdersi nel vento, con le rose.
,Tanto è forte che non cederà
,non sfiorirà.
,Io lo veglierò
,io lo difenderò
,da tutte quelle insidie velenose
,che vorrebbero strapparlo al cuor,
,povero amor!
,Forse se ne andrai...
,D’altre donne le carezze cercherai!...
,ahimè...
,E se tornerai
,già sfiorita ogni bellezza troverai
,in me... Ma l’amore no
,L’amore mio non può
,dissolversi con l’oro dei capelli.
,Fin ch’io vivo sarà vivo in me,
,Solo per te!

,Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
,And think of you
,Caught up in circles confusion
,Is nothing new
,Flashback - warm nights
,Almost left behind
,Suitcases of memories
,Time after
,Sometimes you picture me
,I’m walking too far ahead
,You’re calling to me, I can’t hear
,What you’ve said
,Then you say - go slow
,I fall behind
,The second hand unwinds
,If you’re lost you can look - and you will find me
,Time after time
,If you fall I will catch you - I’ll be waiting
,Time after time
,♬
,After my picture fades and darkness has
,Turned to gray
,Watching through windows - you’re Wondering
,If I’m O.K.
,Secrets stolen from deep inside
,The drum beats out of time
,If you’re lost you can look - and you will find me
,Time after time
,If you fall I will catch you - I’ll be waiting
,Time after time
,If you’re lost you can look - and you will find me

,绿瓦青砖 再无二人相与
,孤月清风 赚得几多欢喜
,幽兰萋萋 收拾二三残雨

,悠悠我心 不得白首相依
,白云一去 天地只我孤影
,风雨已去 叶落无痕

,形影相吊无倦意
,诉不尽相思蚀骨 盼来日细磨红豆
,望来生携手同游

,我在细赏年少事
,那些欢乐和别致
,一年年一点点
,七月它悠悠无事
,撩起了一阵风
,流萤飘过檐下镂窗
,有蛙声点缀那池塘
,溪光和城墙 被细细吟唱
,回忆在悄悄发痒
,星子铺满一张竹床
,羽扇摇落满院书香
,束起了长发神儿朗朗
,夜市它藏起白昼里的艳阳
,等暑气销了惆怅
,田埂上才好贪凉
,月半融融的笑脸
,比歌声还悠扬
,尝遍了太多风光
,有一味勾起回想
,等瓜摊近在身旁
,眯着眼琢磨得多少斤两
,郎对花姐对花
,一对对到田埂下
,是谁临摹天边红霜
,匀成刀下片片玉香
,咬一口甜凉心尖儿都荡漾
,管什么夜短昼长
,我把归途秉烛照亮
,衣袍看作香云纱裳
,当月色停泊我的眉头
,桥边才望见树枝上的倦鸟儿
,等暑气销了惆怅
,灯火下思绪万丈
,支起明媚的笑脸
,摊开手掌端详
,等夜风越过南墙
,我眼前不再迷茫
,那些惬意的寻常
,值得我为此而留步欣赏
,当季节换了衣裳
,当岁月伴我成长
,年少懵懂的思念
,荡漾在我心上
,等河水慢慢秋凉
,我眉间一片疏朗
,那些惬意的寻常
,值得我为此而笑着思量
,丢下一粒籽发了一颗芽
,么秆子么叶开的什么花
,结的什么籽磨的什么粉
,做的什么粑此花儿叫做
,呀得儿呀得儿喂呀

,Such a feelin's comin' over me
,There is wonder in most everything I see
,Not a cloud in the sky
,Got the sun in my eyes
,And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
,Everything I want the world to be
,Is now coming true especially for me
,And the reason is clear
,It's because you are here
,You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
,I'm on the top of the world lookin'
,down on creation
,And the only explanation I can find
,Is the love that I've found
,ever since you've been around
,Your love's put me at the top of the world
,Something in the wind has learned my name
,And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
,In the leaves on the trees
,and the touch of the breeze
,There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
,There is only one wish on my mind
,When this day is through I hope that I will find
,That tomorrow will be
,just the same for you and me
,All I need will be mine if you are here
,I'm on the top of the world lookin'
,down on creation
,And the only explanation I can find
,Is the love that I've found
,ever since you've been around
,Your love's put me at the top of the world
,top of the world
,I'm on the top of the world lookin'
,down on creation
,And the only explanation I can find
,Is the love that I've found

,I heard he sang a good song
,I heard he had a style
,And so I came to see him and listen for a while
,And there he was this young boy
,A stranger to my eyes
,Strumming my pain with his fingers
,Singing my life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,Killing me softly with his song
,Telling my whole life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,I felt all flushed with fever
,Embarrassed by the crowd
,I felt he found my letters and read each word out loud
,I prayed that he would finish
,But he just kept right on
,Strumming my pain with his fingers
,Singing my life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,Killing me softly with his song
,Telling my whole life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,He said as if he knew me
,In all my god's spaer
,And then he looked right through me
,As if i wasn't there
,And he just kept on singing
,Singing clear and strong
,Strumming my pain with his fingers
,Singing my life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,Killing me softly with his song
,Telling my whole life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song
,La La La
,He was trumming my pain
,Here he was singing my life
,Killing me softly with his song
,Killing me softly with his song
,Telling my whole life with his words
,Killing me softly with his song

,Imagine there's no heaven
,It's easy if you try
,No hell below us
,Above us, only sky
,Imagine all the people living for today
,Imagine there's no countries
,It isn't hard to do
,Nothing to kill or die for
,No religion, too
,Imagine all the people living life in peace
,You may say I'm a dreamer
,But I'm not the only one
,I hope some day you'll join us
,And the world will be as one
,Imagine no possessions
,I wonder if you can
,No need for greed or hunger
,A brotherhood of man
,Imagine all the people sharing all the world
,You may say I'm a dreamer
,But I'm not the only one
,I hope some day you'll join us
,And the world will live as one
,You may say I'm a dreamer
,But I'm not the only one

,Like a nightingale without a song to sing

,I keep wishing I were somewhere else
,Walking down a strange new street
,Hearing words that I have never heard

,I;m as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
,I;m as giddy as a baby on a swing
,I haven;t seen a crocus or a rosebud
,Or a robin on the wing
,But I feel so guy in a melancholy way
,That it might as well be spring
,It might as well be spring

,That bring me happiness or pain

,An airline ticket to romantic places
,And still my heart has wings

,A tinkling piano in the next apartment
,Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
,A fair ground's painted swings
,These foolish things remind me of you
,You came you saw you conquer'd me
,When you did that to me
,I knew somehow this had to be
,The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
,A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

,And candle lights on little corner tables

,The look of love
,Is in your eyes
,The look your smile can't disguise
,The look of love
,Is saying so much more
,Than just words could ever say
,And what my heart has heard
,Well it takes my breath away
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,You've got the look of love
,It's on your face
,A look that time can't erase
,Be mine tonight
,Let this be just the start
,Of so many nights like this
,Let's take a lover's vow
,And then seal it with a kiss
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,Don't ever go
,Don't ever go
,I love you so
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Making love with you is all I want to do
Loving you is more than just a dream come true
Everything that I do is out of loving you
La la la la la ........

Doo doo din doo doo ah
No one else can make me feel the colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime
Loving you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with loving you
Loving you I see your soul come shining through
And every time that we oh I'm more in love with you

,The shadow of your smile
,When you are gone
,Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
,Look into my eyes
,My love,and see

,Ma dove andiamo che c'è un traffico da pazzi
,Se sei in costume sulla sabbia calda a piedi scalzi
,Le solite vecchiette maledicono i ragazzi che col pallone per giocare non trovano spazi
,Gli ombrelloni giù da noi sono condomini
,Ci trovi parentele assurde con nuovi cugini
,Fai pranzo e cena con una pizza di maccheroni
,Leggende narrano che dopo se fai il bagno muori
,C'è il venditore ambulante coi miei cd e chi ne parla male poi passa l'estate qui
,È così strano che il turismo non esploda, quando in altri posti anche un traghetto sul laghetto va di moda
,Guardo le stelle in cielo e se qualcuna brilla penserò che pure in cielo sia riuscita a mettere una firma
,Vero, non siamo perfetti, abbiamo migliaia di difetti, colonizzati ma crisciut ca' cazzimm
,Vorrei svegliarmi presto la mattina, correre insieme e non sentirmi stanco
,Liberi e spensierati come prima, il tempo vola in queste notti in bianco
,Sto bene, sto bene così
,Quanti difetti che c'hai, terra mia
,Sto bene così
,Sto bene, sto bene così
,Fammi ballare fino all'alba, portami a Catania
,Oppure portami a Palermo, andiamo au Ballarò
,Mi piace Lecce, fore de capu le dance hall
,A Bari chi non si diverte è nu trmon
,Reggio Calabria, il lungo mare affaccia sullo stretto
,La gente è positiva e porta il mare dentro
,Così bella quest'Italia, non la cambierei per niente
,Te ne accorgi quando guardi dentro gli occhi della gente
,Amo il Cilento e poi d'estate si va a Palinuro
,Vita selvaggia come ad Agosto in Sardegna
,Ma ci divertiremmo pure a Varcaturo perché non importa il posto ma una comitiva degna
,A Pescara arrostici e party
,Rimini e Riccione senza mai addormentarci
,Tra gli inciuci di quartiere e le leggende di provincia
,Noi cresciamo dove un sogno finisce appena incomincia
,Vorrei svegliarmi presto la mattina, correre insieme e non sentirmi stanco
,Liberi e spensierati come prima, il tempo vola in queste notti in bianco
,Sto bene, sto bene così
,Quanti difetti che c'hai, terra mia
,Sto bene così
,Sto bene, sto bene così
,Sto bene, sto bene
,Ma sto buon accussì, i sto buon accussì
,Rest incantat a guarda' 'o ciel e m difend a terra mij
,Se non ci lasci non puoi mai capire davvero chi siamo, senza giudicare
,Storie d'estate, di barche lontane, di vicoli antichi che portano al mare
,Vorrei svegliarmi presto la mattina
,Liberi e spensierati come prima
,Sto bene, sto bene così
,Sto bene, sto bene così

,And I'm in time but your vision transcends
,Yet still you involve your will in my ends
,I admit that only a small part I see
,A small fish tryinto envision the whole sea
,And I want to be a visionary bringer of the light
,But many times I feel like
,I'm blind preaching a sight
,That I don't have
,Theres a portion of me lackin
,Telling me to seek a darkness to go back in
,But you reassure me to take heart
,For your light is the catalyst in my mind the spark
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,I am but a product of my nature
,
,Sinking deeper into all my crimes
,
,And many times I wonder if the maker
,
,Has made me with the right design in mind
,
,And I try to explain it all away
,The rhythm of the rains or where their winds sway
,But I find it all futile a figment of my fears
,It all futile a figment of my tears
,Then the sun sets in the night there I see
,The moon shining in the black canvas for me
,So I choose to believe in the message of the sky
,The rising of the son is my only true guide
,Let me sing a soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,A soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,I'll never be the same
,
,Oh no
,
,I'll never be the same
,A soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony
,
,And I will go through darkness and every pain
,So refine my heart that I'll never be the same
,
,A soulful melody
,
,Of the truth in blessed harmony

,
,And most importantly how do I get out
,
,See I believe in a faithful creator

,Just put the digits done to be self
,Can't nobody
,Just claim what you doing under the influence what you gain
,Blew it cause sand influence is what you made to be
,Basically all you can do now is keep moving
,Should waste discussing
,Pull those die pull why use to causing
,Losing your mind

,Put all the troubles of the past behind me
,I wont fall see I’m standing tall
,so I, side step and leave it aside
,put all the troubles of the past behind
,Verse 1:
,Put all the troubles on the back burner let it blow steam
,and forget it all happened like old dreams
,yo we gotta focus, we got a goal who can be the closest
,some people good but they ain’t the dopest.
,you see I,
,Had beef carniceria,
,but all it gave me was mad grief senorita
,I had to leave her, I put a note on the side,
,with an arrow pointing up because you know that I’m fly, if I
,Had to do it all over, I wouldn’t change a thing
,ain’t no tellin what today will bring, I mean
,one minute I’m just fine,
,till my troubles start adding up like I’m hitting the plus sign
,Everybody must find a way. we must find
,how to get up out of our own way, crunch time
,gotta keep the bad weather at bay, plus I
,got a vision of a brighter day, sunshine (yeah)
,Chorus:
,Put all the troubles of the past behind me
,I wont fall see I’m standing tall
,so I, side step and leave it aside
,put all the troubles of the past behind (yeah)

,put all the troubles of the past behind
,Verse 2:
,Its now or never, I won’t be buried in sorrow
,gotta focus on the present to get a better tomorrow
,so I’m just letting it all go, relax the mind and hope the rest will follow, keep your head sleepy hollow, I will
,Do whatever that I must do
,for my messege to come through
,Whether its diplomatic or bust tooth
,its just truth that you can’t deny
,a single voice from the youth but I’m amplified, I might
,Go crazy, cuz nobody can phase me
,cuz nobody can slow the momentum of my flow
,going down hill, though I’m moving up, blowin up
,for anybody who doubted me homie I show em up
,sure as hell, my troubles about to set sail
,no time like the present, comparisons just fail
,don’t bail on reality, either see your dreams become true or stay a fantasy
,which place would you rather be
,Chorus:
,Put all the troubles of the past behind me
,I wont fall see I’m standing tall
,so I, side step and leave it aside
,put all the troubles of the past behind (yeah)
,Put all the troubles of the past behind me
,I wont fall see I’m standing tall

,Sometimes you wanna kick back and relax, you know cool out
,A day when you don't pull the tool out
,And put a fool out for causing grief or mischief
,You ain't trying to hear about that beef or this beef
,Cause this piece
,Is to break away from all that
,I got a hit on my hip when I call back
,It was my nigga Ray
,"Yo dawg what's the haps?"
,"Ain't nothin', just fucking with some beats for your raps."
,"'Bout to link up with Cali Beef, Hawk and Jinx."
,"I'ma meet y'all at Franks for some blunts and drinks."
,"Aight"
,The rest of the night was tight, no cops reading me my rights
,I like those type of summer nights
, {x2}
,I like those type of summer nights
,
,It was mad people hanging, in Houston they swanging
,"It was one of those nights" when there was no gang banging
,Mad love in the air
,Seen a crew about ten brothers deep and they didn't even stare
,But still beware
,Cause the moon is full
,But even that couldn't give bloodshed some pull
,As I embark into the dark I trek through the park
,I see my team got it on lock
,Let me make my mark with the weed that I spark
,And swim through this ocean of skins like a shark
,I skylark with my higher ark then I'm up and about
,I bullshitted for a few then I was out
,I had the munchies, I pulled in Micky D's
,The aftermath of Heinekens with sticky trees
,Twelve midnight still about a hundred degrees
,The summer night didn't hype enemies
,
,
,Ayo slept all day, woke up around 8:30
,Summer nights got a nigga feeling all dirty
,Type of day when you don't wanna make moves
,When to the phone and called up the snakes moves
,Skin talking 'bout, "Please Tangg come scoop me."
,Slid through in a black Acura hooptie
,Seen her, put her in a whip, hold the nina
,Nights like this we bound to catch a misdemeanor
,Just seen my team rocking brand new sneaks
,Looking like they just robbed Harry The Greek
,Would've kicked it but was trying to get my ish
,When my duty call I be on a booty call mis'
,Hit the park we getting bit by bugs
,But I guess that's better than getting hit by slugs
,And the police...
,Yo they couldn't get dumber
,And that's why a nigga love nights in the summer

,Maybe I'm selfish, call me see through
,But I'm debating if I really need to
,Tie tie to someone forever
,Sure I get lonely sometimes, I miss being together
,But when, when I roam from city to city
,With the highway and the crowds, and the hunger that's in me
,Fill me up with fireworks and tell me I'm skinny
,Soak up the fire and the buzz they give me
,Oo oo oo oo oo
,Long nights, stay up late
,Drink the sky, meditate

,嗨  你好  阿宁姑娘
,你一个人走在回家的路上
,冬天的晚风会有一些凉
,你是否会讨厌穿厚衣裳
,嗨  你好  阿宁姑娘
,我在下雨的苏州等待月光
,我是个粗糙的北方男人
,在异乡的路上丢了方向
,我不曾见过你的模样
,就像我不曾到过远方
,你不曾听过这首歌
,也没有见过悲伤的我
,其实我不想再流浪
,我想回到北方等待死亡
,其实你也渴望阳光
,只是夜晚更适合伪装
,我不曾见过你的模样
,就像我不曾到过远方
,你不曾听过这首歌
,也没有见过倔强的我
,其实我注定要流浪
,漂泊的人已回不去故乡
,其实你不必再隐藏
,难熬的夜它终究会天亮

,人来人往  聚散的匆忙
,心怀期待的人还在等待
,攒满失望的人已离开
,谁怂了  谁眼睛红了
,失无所失 计较着什么
,分别后的难过都是依赖
,无法相拥的人要好好道别
,倘若你在四下无人的夜突然想起我
,希望你能记得曾几何时我也深爱过
,无心风月  独钟你
,太认真了我弄丢了自己
,当初我自云云人海之中独独看到你
,如今我再将你好好的还回人海里
,至此流年  各天涯
,明天的路你不要害怕
,我走了

,装作她的朋友 半天都不想走
,兄弟都看不下去了连自己也无法忍受
,而接她下班的人又换了一个在等候
,身边不缺狐狸精 他们有的来自微信
,聊天的话题随性 biggie tupac死于非命
,也有的认识在酒吧 喝红牛配红酒
,大部分会跟我回家 是朋友的朋友
,如果说在错的时间遇到对的人无法肯定
,一杯野格加冰块为了能让我冷静
,要么不在乎 她也会有人爱
,要么就当她死了这一切都不存在
,我只能自己心里清楚的
,你表情凝固了
,一放完这首歌
,你会更幸福的
,最值得庆祝的

,Got up here like a pair of thieves
,While the sirens blare outside

,What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
,What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
,What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
,But sometimes...
,Do you remember how this started out?
,So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt
,A dirty joke we used to laugh about
,But it's not funny anymore
,I fear I choke unless I spit it out
,Still smell of smoke. although the fire's gone out
,Can't live with you. but I die without
,What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
,What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
,What's left to do when we've lost all hope and

,Spelar det längre någon roll
,Jag orkar inte slåss
,Det är bortom min kontroll
,Du lämnade mig ensam
,Och självklart blev jag rädd
,Min sista gnista hopp
,Var att synas att bli sedd
,Och jag glömmer bort att andas
,För sex, musik och våld
,Var det vackraste som hänt mig
,Sen själen min blev såld
,Att synas utan att verka
,Ser enkelt ut på håll
,Men jag lever på impuls nu
,Via fjärrkontroll
,Men jag sa alltid nej

,Om sin nya Z-3
,I en värld av Idioter
,Står han först i kön

,All of his life, his master's toys
,Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
,Living his life one day at a time
,And showing himself a pretty good time
,Laughing about the way they want him to be

,Feelin of depression
,The second guessing of every step
,Has got me stressing like you'd never expect
,Cos I can see the wave
,When it takes you
,Recreates you shakes you down
,And breaks you and makes you
,Stronger in the end
,You'll go through it again
,I won't lie
,But you know that I'll be right by your side
,Work through the struggle
,And get you outta trouble
,When you're stuck in the rubble
,I'ma do what I can
,To be your man
,And I might not understand
,But I'll be the first to make you smile
,And take you by hand
,So when you feel like there ain't
,No escape from the weight
,Just remember that tomorrow is a brighter day
,There's little things in life that'll light the way
,So anytime your feeling down you might hear me say
,You are my everything baby
,I will never let you go
,You are my everything baby
,I will never let you go
,I'm so lucky I'm so free
,The way you feel about me
,So lucky I'm so free

Uma história de paixão
Um romance do sertão
Que tomou meu coração
Vou cantar nesse baião
Te chamei para dançar
Te pedi pra namorar
Num forró do interior
Tu me deste o teu amor
Quero casar com Saliane
Quero casar com Saliane
Vou lhe dar meu sobrenome
Nunca mais vais passar fome
Numa igreja lá do Crato
Tu e eu juntamos trapos
Muita dança a noite inteira
Teve até retrato
Quero casar com Saliane
Quero casar com Saliane
Vou lhe dar meu sobrenome
Nunca mais vais passar fome
Muito tempo se passou
Muito filho já criou
Saliane é o meu amor
A minha flor
Quero casar com Saliane
Quero casar com Saliane
Vou lhe dar meu sobrenome
Nunca mais vais passar fome
Quero casar com Saliane
Quero casar com Saliane
Vou lhe dar meu sobrenome
Nunca mais vais passar fome

Quero casar com Saliane
Who's gonna marry Saliane?
Quero casar com Saliane

I came 
I came from Bahia to sing 
I came from Bahia to bring out 
the beauty it left within me 
This is where my heart always will be 
With my land, with my sky and my sea 
My Bahia is here to let us learn 
to live our life without concern 

It's where people don't have food to eat 
But we're friendly and happy to greet you 
with hope and with faith 
We know that the arms of the saints 
keep us safe 
and help us to sing and take pride 
When we dance samba they're on our side 
When we're dying of joy 
In street celebrations, 
In rhythmical glee 
And in moon contemplations 
At the edge of the sea 

I came from Bahia 
But I'm gonna return 
I came from Bahia 
One of these days I'm gonna return
,I Wish I Could Go Travelling Again
,Stacey Kent
,
,I wish I could go travelling again
,It feels like this summer will never end
,And I've had such good offers from several of my friends
,I wish I could go travelling again
,
,I want to sit in my shades,sipping my latte
,Beneath the awning of a famous cafe
,Jet-legged and with our luggage gone astay
,I wish I could go travelling again
,
,I want a waiter to give us a reprimand
,In a language neither of us understand
,While we argue about the customs of the land
,I wish I could go travelling again
,
,I want to sit in traffic anxious about our plane
,While your blase comments drive me half insane
,I want to dash for shelter with you through the tropical rain
,I wish I could go travelling again
,I want to be awakened by a faulty fire alarm
,In an overpriced hotel devoid of charm
,Then fall asleep again back in your arms
,I wish I could go travelling again
,
,Bur how can I ever go travelling again
,When I know I'll just keep remenbering again
,When I know I'll just be gathering again
,Reminders to break my heart
,
,I wish I could go travelling again
,It feels like this summer will never end
,And I've had such good offers from several of my friends
,I wish I could go travelling again

,E quis salvar meu coração

A toda hora rola uma história
Que é preciso estar atento
A todo instante rola um movimento
Que muda o rumo dos ventos
Quem sabe remar não estranha
Vem chegando a luz de um novo dia
O jeito é criar um outro samba
Sem rasgar a velha fantasia

Mulher é isso aí
Só existe a gente mesmo
Levando um barco pesado
Apesar do agitado mar
Sem a lua e seu encanto
Ao sabor da ventania
Mesmo no gelo da noite
Meu coração não esfria
E quando o vendaval passar
Acharemos uma ilha
E até quando Deus deixar, mulher
Iremos tocando a vida
,Michael Buble - Whatever It Takes
,
,We've all been hurt by love
,It's out of our hands
,But for all it's worth
,I'm drawing a line in the sand
,Another morning just won't do
,I need your love to shine on through
,Or it won't be new
,Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
,Whatever it takes my love
,To put the lonely days behind us
,I'm laying it down
,If there's a chance
,For two hearts to celebrate
,To blow out some candles
,And tempt the hands of fate
,You make a wish, I'll make one too
,But close your eyes love when you do
,Or it won't be true
,Whatever it takes, my love
,'Cos I've been wandering 'round
,With the same old blues
,That have been dragging me down
,If you feel the same way too
,Maybe it takes two
,And if we give thanks
,For our love at each new dawn
,We'll find the strength
,And the will to carry on
,The sun alone will never do
,Without your love to shine on through
,It just won't be new
  When marimba rhythms start to play 
 Dance with me, make me sway 
 Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore 
 Hold me close, sway me more 
 
 Like a flower bending in the breeze 
 Bend with me, sway with ease 
 When we dance you have a way with me 
 Stay with me, sway with me 
 
 Other dancers may be on the floor 
 Dear, but my eyes will see only you 
 Only you have the magic technique 
 When we sway I go weak 
 
 I can hear the sounds of violins 
 Long before it begins 
 Make me thrill as only you know how 
 Sway me smooth, sway me now 
 
 Other dancers may be on the floor 
 Dear, but my eyes will see only you 
 Only you have the magic technique

 I can hear the sounds of violins 
 Long before it begins 
 Make me thrill as only you know how 
 Sway me smooth, sway me now 
 You know how 
 Sway me smooth, sway me now

,From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
,The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
,'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
,But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
,Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
,'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
,Oh Danny boy, Danny boy, I love you so.
,
,And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
,And I am dead, as dead I well may be
,You'll come and find the place where I am lying
,And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
,And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
,And all my dreams will warmer and sweeter be
,If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
,I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
,I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

,And sometime we find that life is just a simple song

,Выжимаю максимум
,Я иду к тому, чтобы гнуть свою линию
,И сказать, что все вы — так себе
,Не хуже и не лучше, просто так себе

,This road that I'm taking Twists and turns
,My life my chance turning dreams into reality.
,Down this path Faced with so many things
,Sometimes I feel like giving up and turn away
,Can't seem to go on. And I've been thru' this before.
,Now where am I? Where do I stand? A little lost here.
,But I'll remember. All those times you've bought me thru'.
,I'd be a fool to give up cos' the goal is near
,I'll move on I'll go on. Lord I will take your hand.
,And you will guide me along. Survive thru' this storm.
,So I say, come what may. I'll hold on to my hope.
,Yes, I will walk down this road.
,And my passion drive will lead me on.
,Here I am Once again Caught in the rain.
,Looking back I've come sofar And I want to carry on
,Take a step A little time It's alright.
,Even thru' this rain, I want to smile again
,Don't hold back now. And i've been thru' this before.
,Now where am I? Where do I stand? A little lost here.
,But I'll remember. All those times you've bought me thru'.
,I can feel the sun shining down on me
,Here I am, Here I am. Lord I will take your hand.
,And you will guide me along. Survive thru' this storm.

 "They did not have the power to stop Louis Farrakhan
 They were trying to touch on and feed envy within the leadership
 But as a general and a man that rose through the ranks through discipline
 His presence inspired those men with the discipline he imposed on his own life
 Louis Farrakhan"
 
 
,
 No revolutionary gets old or so I'm told
 Your left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free
 Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
 I heard gun shots rang; his bullet's got my name
 I ain't see 'em take aim, I dreamt this day came
 'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
 Satan spat at 'em, flat out disgraced 'em
 He want my blood, why me?
 Why not the fake who deserve death man?
 Fuck it, I'll take one
 'Cause stop me but can't stop a whole nation of millions who feel you deceived them
 They believe in reparation makes it even
 So I'm deadly now because of one reason, they listening
 In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
 We getting it in son, another bullet pass by, miss me
 Wondering who plotting to get me?
 Alphabet boys still plotting against me
 To hush me and stuff me in the pockets of history
 You won't remember why they came to clip me
 When time go by you'll soon forget me
 They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentley's
 Then I use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
 Don't let' em kill me...

 Mansion for the wife the rest for the children
 Knowing that they coming anytime
 But until then I'm gonna in lost till they shoot me
 Million dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci

我的眼瞳
诉说着深情
爱的伤痕
何日抚平

哈萨克圣贤
见多识广的人
都不能形容
你美丽的绝伦

我默然泪下
我挥笔疾书
心动的一刻
故作着矜持

对你的泣诉
言不尽的倾慕
无需赘语
你也应知

Come on, come over
As fast as you can
You're afraid that you won't like it
But you don't understand
One thing, my brother
I can tell you true
The more time you spend feeling happy
The less time you'll be blue
Come on, come over
Everyone's waiting on you
We're wondering when you'll get tired
Of wondering what to do
There is something here that cannot be denied
Get on the floor, get on down
Don't knock it until you try
Come on, come over
The pleasure is all mine
Music's playin', the door just opened
You don't have to stand in line
People of the world
Have been uptight far too long
While you're busy making stands
Everybody's making plans
To move on, move right along 

If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there then you'll know
For me to stay here, I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person a that you really are now
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my woman, taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow, I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
I'll be good, I wish I could
(I'll be good, I wish I could)
Get this message over to you now
(This message over to you now)
And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person a that you really are now
I'll be so good, I wish I could
Get this message over to you now
Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good, I wish I could

,I’ve just noted that my skin
,Is a bit clearer than usual
,It whistles within.
,Just did you see the light is burnin’ now through me
,In a minute oh oh
,I’ll make out a patch on the sofa behind me
,So please, put your hands on me to be sure I’m still living.
,And if you can, hold me as hard as you can
,It gives me a shape, a substance of a shade
,You don’t need to find the right words.
,I am invisible, so invisible
,But when you touch me you see me with your hands, oh
,I am invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end,
,So touch me.
,There’s dust flowin’ in my veins,
,Sparklin’ in electric lights then fallin as lil’ snowflakes
,And awful drafts yells in my brest and chills
,I fell to the ground even if I can’t see they’re still hold my soul
,Oh but please, come closer and define all lines of what I am,
,Then give me a shape a substance and a shade,
,I am whisper not too far away from you and easy
,I am invisible, so invisible
,But when you touch me you see me with your hands, oh
,I am invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end,
,Oh, Tell me well I am just invisible so invisible,
,when you touch me you can see me with your hands.
,Oh, no, oh
,I’m just invisible, so invisible
,I know your skin, will reveal me at the end, oh at the end.
,Transparency, now can you see me fadin’
,Transparency，indeed a system failin’
,Like a fresh stitch to praise my poor and rain all over vanishing a moment
,But ain’t no way I see no explanation to watch it here I have to face the fact that I’m disappearing
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,Desperately searching for reflection in a mirror.
,Pull up in my hair lots of questions in my head
,I can’t figure out if I’m alive or if I’m dead, u forget to
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,Desperately searching for a purpose in a mirror
,While I’m watching I’m putting up my fire
,I can’t seem to be seen that I need to be admired.
,Take a moment take a seat, think it over
,I can’t seem to be seen that I need to be admired
,Take a moment take breeze and think it over
,Midnight leaving now.

Failing in love again
Never wanted to
What am i to do?
Can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it as i may
I was born that way
Can't help it
Men flock around me
Like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn
I know i'm not to blame
I'm falling
Can't help it
,The Way You Look Tonight
,Maroon 5
,Valentine's Day OST
,
,Some day, when I'm awfully low,
,When the world is cold,
,I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
,And the way you look tonight.
,
,Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
,And your cheeks so soft,
,There is nothing for me but to love you,
,And the way you look tonight.
,
,With each word your tenderness grows,
,Tearing my fear apart...
,And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
,It touches my foolish heart.
,
,Lovely ... Never, ever change.
,Keep that breathless charm.
,Won't you please arrange it ?
,'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.
,
,
,And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,

,Was a fool with my money
,And I lost every dime
,Sun stopped shining
,And it rained all the time
,Did set me back some
,I made it through
,But I'll never get over losing you
,Do you know how much you mean to me?
,Should've told you 'what it's true
,I'd get over losing anything
,But I'll never get over losing you
,When you're young
,And there's time
,To forget the past
,You won't think that time
,But you will
,I know that I don't have time enough
,Cause I'll never get over losing you
,I've been cold
,I've been hungry
,But not for awhile
,The most of my dreams have come true
,With it all here around me
,No peace do I find
,Cause I'll never get over losing you
,No, I'll never get over losing you
,Blue moon you saw me standing alone
,Without a dream in my heart
,Without a love of my own
,Blue moon
,You knew just what I was there for
,You heard me saying a pray'r for
,Someone I really could care for
,And then there suddenly appeared before me
,The only one my arms will ever hold
,I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
,And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
,Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone
,Without a dream in my heart
,Without a love of my own
,

From Russia with love I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return from Russia with love
I've seen places, faces and smiled for a moment
But oh, you haunted me so
Still my tongue tied young pride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say no
To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I fly to you from Russia with love

Embriagarte y hacer que olvides tus penas
Juego de amor de noche a mañana romperte la ropa
Que te sientas amada
Apagar la luz tirarte en la cama
Y enseñarte porque en esto tengo fama
Tu quieres conmigo lo que yo quiero contigo
Veremos que pasa despues del vino

Dos cuerpos en uno hasta mas no poder

Ya sabra porque mi hobie es el amor
Acuerdate de esto aqui no hay secreto
Otra copa mas y acabemos con esto

Salsa, salsa, ritmo que da vida
Que todos escuchan
Que el mundo quiere bailar, salsa
Ven para bailar, mi salsa
Ven para cantar, mi salsa
Para reir mamÃ¡, mi salsa
Ven para gozar
La salsa que aquÃ&shy; les traigo
La traigo directo mira
La traigo de las entraÃ±as
De mi AmÃ©rica Latina
El dÃ&shy;a que estes llorando
Y tu alma se encuentre triste
Si bailas salsa mi hermano
OlvidarÃ¡s que lo fuiste
Salsa, salsa ritmo que da vida
Que todos escuchan
Que el mundo quiere bailar, salsa
Ven para bailar, mi salsa
Ven para cantar, mi salsa
Para reir mamÃ¡, mi salsa
Ven para gozar
El consejo de alegrÃ&shy;a
Me lo ha dado un africano
Que no llore, que me rÃ&shy;a
Si todos somos hermanos
Y asÃ&shy; integrando los pueblos
CantÃ¡ndole a las naciones
Vamo' a llegar a viejos
Con salsa en los corazones
Sentimiento de alegrÃ&shy;a
Cantar es la vida mÃ&shy;a salsa
No quiero que te acomplejes mucha salsa
Ven y expresa lo que sientes salsa
Lo quiere bailar la gente mucha salsa
Porque es simple y diferente salsa
Es el ritmo que da vida mucha salsa
Lo bailarÃ¡ y pasa heridas salsa
Llevala pal' rincon y apriÃ©tala mucha salsa
Porque ella no baila sola salsa
Y si se atraviesa un gato mucha salsa
Pues mÃ¡ndalo pa' la cola salsa
El mundo quiere cantar
El mundo quiere bailar, salsa
Ven y dime si eres salsero
Es la gente que yo mÃ¡s quiero
El mundo quiere cantar
El mundo quiere bailar, salsa
Con orgullo yo soy sonero
Al pueblo no te lo niego
Oye para la gente de Colombia, Venezuela
PanamÃ¡, azuquita, un saludo
Puerto Rico, oye la gente chevere, saludos
La gente de Francia, tambiÃ©n que no se me quede atrÃ¡s
Los de Africa, africando
Oye allÃ¡, la gente de nueva york y Miami, a comer
Oye llegÃ³ Charly Sierra pa' que Puedas gozar
Distinto y diferente
Ultima noticia, se acabaron los muÃ±equitos

Um cantinho, um violão 
Este amor, uma canção 
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama 
Muita calma pra pensar 
E ter tempo pra sonhar 
Da janela vê-se o Corcovado 
O Redentor, que lindo 
Quero a vida sempre assim 
Com você perto de mim 
Até o apagar de velha chama 
E eu que era triste 
Descrente deste mundo 
Ao encontrar você eu conheci 
O que é felicidade meu amor 
Feliz assim 
Muita calma pra pensar 
E ter tempo pra sonhar 
Da janela vê-se o Corcovado 
O Redentor, que lindo 
Quero a vida sempre assim 
Com você perto de mim 
Até, o apagar, da velha chama 
E eu que era triste 
Descrente deste mundo 
Ao encontrar você eu conheci 
O que é felicidade meu amor 
Meu amor, meu amor 
O que é felicidade meu amor 
Quiet night of quiet stars 
Quiet chords from my guitar 
Quiet night of quiet stars 
Quiet chords from my guitar
作曲 : deMoraes
Tomara,
Que você volte depressa
Que você não se despessa
Nunca mais, do meu carinho
E chore e se arrependa e pense muito,
Que é melhor se sofrer junto
Que viver, feliz sozinho...
Tomara...
Tomara,
Que a tristeza te convença
Que a saudade não compensa
E que a ausência não dá paz
O verdadeiro amor de quem se ama,
Essa é mesmo diga trama
Que não se disfaz
E a coisa mais divina que há no mundo
É viver cada segundo como nunca mais...
,If it takes forever I will wait for you
,For a thousand summers I will wait for you
,Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you
,Till I hear you sigh here in my arms.
,
,Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
,Every day remember how I love you so
,In your heart believe what in my heart I know
,That forevermore I'll wait for you.
,
,The clock will tick away the hours one by one
,Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
,The time when you return and find me here and run
,Straight to my waiting arms.
,
,If it takes forever I will wait for you
,For a thousand summers I will wait for you
,Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you
,And forevermore sharing your love...
,
,Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you
,And forevermore I'll wait
,for you...

Ando com minha cabeça já pelas tabelas
Claro que ninguém se toca com a minha aflição
Quando vi todo mundo na rua de blusa amarela
Eu achei que era ela puxando o cordão
8 horas e danço de blusa amarela
Minha cabeça talvez faça as pazes assim
Quando eu vi a cidade de noite batendo as panelas
Eu pensei que era ela voltando pra mim
Minha cabeça de noite batendo panelas
Provavelmente não deixa a cidade dormir
Quando vi um bocado de gente descendo as favelas
Eu achei que era o povo que vinha pedir 
A cabeça de um homem que olhava as favelas
Minha cabeça rolando no Maracanã
Quando vi a galera aplaudindo de pé as tabelas
Eu jurei que era ela que vinha chegando
Com minha cabeça ja pelas tabelas
Claro que ninguém se toca com a minha aflição
Quando vi todo mundo na rua de blusa amarela
Eu achei que era ela puxando o cordão
8 horas e danço de blusa amarela
Minha cabeça talvez faça as pazes assim
Quando eu vi a cidade de noite batendo as panelas
Eu pensei que era ela voltando pra mim
Minha cabeça de noite batendo panelas
Provavelmente não deixa a cidade dormir
Quando vi um bocado de gente descendo as favelas
Eu achei que era o povo que vinha pedir 
A cabeça de um homem que olhava as favelas
Minha cabeça rolando no Maracanã
Quando vi a galera aplaudindo de pé as tabelas
Eu jurei que era ela que vinha chegando
Com minha cabeça já numa baixela
Claro que ninguém se toca com a minha aflição
Quando vi todo mundo na rua de blusa amarela
Eu achei que era ela puxando o cordão
Ando com minha cabeça já pelas tabelas (2x)
Ando com minha cabeça (2x)
Ando com minha cabeça já numa baixela
Ando com minha cabeça (2x)
Ando com minha cabeça batendo panelas
Rise your eyes, the time has come
Rise your eyes, there's a yearning
There's a burning in the skies, walking
Walking helpless in undiscovered land,
from tomorrow to today and yesterday
,
Now - from now on you'll remember what you've done
You'll be cryin', you'll be tryin' not to fall
Now - now you see, life is just a memory
You'll be cryin', you 'll be tryin' to recall
Time will tell, faith was mine
Time will tell, would you bless me,
and caress me if I fell?
Sadly living through this irony
You'll forget me in the emptiness of time
, 

作曲 : Jovanotti
Vorrei poterti dare quello che mi manca
Vorrei poterti dire quello che non so
Vorrei che questa pagina tornasse bianca
Per scriverci
Ti amo...punto.
Benedetta la luce così ti posso guardare
Coprirla con la camicia quando facciamo l'amore
E benedetta autostrada
Specialmente di notte
Che quando guido solo ascolto musica
E ti penso ti penso
E prima o poi arrivo
E se stai ancora dormendo mi piace anche di più
Che ti sveglio ti bacio e poi ti riaddormenti
Ma non subito però solo dopo un pò
Vorrei poterti dare quello che mi manca
Vorrei poterti dire quello che non so
Vorrei che questa pagina tornasse bianca
Per scriverci
Ti amo...punto.
Benedetto ritardo che ci ha fatto incontrare
Il giorno in cui avrei dovuto essere puntuale
Loro aspettano ancora ma io ho cambiato programma
Da quando nella vita ci sei te
E ti scappo e ti inseguo
E poi ci raggiungiamo
E' un tango inesorabile la nostra
Melodia
Vorrei poterti dare quello che mi manca
Vorrei poterti dire quello che non so
Vorrei che questa pagina tornasse bianca
Per scriverci
Ti amo...punto.
Benedetta la rosa specialmente le spine
Che fanno in modo di tenerla in mano con attenzione
Perchè le cose più belle stanno in equilibrio
Così come la storia di noi due
Che profuma e che punge
E che non ci da tregua
A meno che non lo vogliamo noi
Che ti scappo e ti inseguo
E poi ci raggiungiamo
E' un tango inesorabile la nostra
Melodia
Vorrei poterti dare quello che mi manca
Vorrei poterti dire quello che non so
Vorrei che questa pagina tornasse bianca
Per scriveci
Ti amo...punto.

,I saw you last night and got that old feeling
,When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
,The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
,And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still
,Once again, I seemed to have that old yearning
,And I knew the spark of love was still burning
,There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
,For that old feeling is still in my heart
,There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
,For that old feeling is still in my heart
,
,I wish you bluebirds in the spring
,To give your heart a song to sing
,I wish you health
,And more than wealth
,I wish you love
,And in July Summer rain
,To cool you in some leafy glade
,I wish you health
,And more than wealth
,I wish you love
,My breaking heart and I agree
,That you and I could never be
,So with my best, my very best
,I set you free
,I wish you shelter from the storm
,A cozy fire to keep you warm
,And most of all
,When snowflakes fall
,I wish you love
,And most of all
,When snowflakes fall
,I wish you love
  In the wee small hours of the morning,
 While the whole wide world is fast asleep,
 You lie awake and think about the girl
 And never, ever think of counting sheep.
 When your lonely heart has learned its lesson,
 You'd be hers if only she would call,
 In the wee small hours of the morning,
 That's the time you miss her most of all.
 
 When your lonely heart has learned its lesson,
 You'd be hers if only she would call,
 In the wee small hours of the morning,
 That's the time you miss her most of all.

,are  we  really  happy
,with  this  lonely  game  we  play
,looking  for  the  right  words  to  say
,searching  but  not  finding
,understanding  anyway
,we're  lost  in  a  masquerade!
,both  afraid  to  say
,we're  just  too  far  away
,from  being  close  together  from  the  start
,we  try  to  talk  it  over
,but  the  words  got  in  the  way
,we're  lost  inside  this  lonely  game  we  play
,thoughts  of  leaving  disappear
,each  time  i  see  your  eyes
,and  no  matter  how  hard  i  try
,to  understand  the  reason
,why  we  carry  on  this  way
,we're  lost  in  a  masquerade !
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
I've only just began to live close to you

Yo son carabalí,
 negro de nación.
 Sin la liberttad
 no pue'o vivi'.
 
 Mundele cabá,
 con mi corazón,
 tanto maltráta,
 cuerpo ta'furi eh
 
 Mundele cumba flote
 siempre ta'ngarua'cha.
 queta' por mucho,
 que yo lo ndinga
 siempre ta'maltratá.

MY BABY JUST CARES FOR ME
Written by Gus K / Walter D

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places
Elizabeth Taylor is not his style
And even Ricky Martin's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
Just says his prayers for
My baby just cares
For me

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening
When the day is through
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young
So new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

  When Mr South Wind sighs in the pines, 
 old Mr Winter whimpers and whines.
 Down in the meadow, under the snow,
 April is teaching green things to grow.
 When Mr West Wind howls in a glade, 
 old Mr Summer nods in the shade.
 Down in the meadow, deep in the brook,
 catfish are waiting for the hook.
 Old Lady Blackbird flirts with the scarecrow,
 scarecrow is waving at the moon.
 Old Mr Moon makes hearts everywhere go bump, bump,
 with the magic of June.
 When Mr East Wind shouts over head,
 then all the leaves turn yellow and red.
 Down in the meadow corn stocks are high
 pumpkins are ripe and ready for pie.
 Old Lady Blackbird flirts with the scarecrow,
 scarecrow's waving at the Moon.
 Old Mr Moon makes hearts everywhere go bump-bump 
 with the magic of June.
 When Mr North Wind rolls on the breeze,
 old father Christmas trims over trees.
 Down in the meadow snow shoftly gleams 
 earth goes to sleep and smiles in her dreams. 

No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
For you, for you, for you
I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you
Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care
Your kisses
Are worth waitin' for
Believe me
I don't stay out late
Got no place to go
I'm home about 8
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' all my love for you
I don't stay out late
Got no place to go
I'm home about 8
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Rosa Passos - É Luxo Só
 
 Olha, esta mulata quando dança
 é luxo só
 
 Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança,
 é luxo só
 
 Tem um nao sei qué
 que faz a confusao
 
 O que ela nao tem, meu Deus
 é compaixao
 Essa mulata quando...
 
 Olha esta mulata quando dança
 é luxo só
 
 Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança,
 é luxo só
 
 Porém seu coração quando se agita
 e palpita mais ligeiro
 Nunca vi compasso táo Brasileiro
 
 Éta samba cai pra lá,
 cai pra cá, cai pra lá,
 Mexe com as cadeiras, mulata
 Seu requebrado me maltrata

ManhÃ£, tÃ£o bonita manhÃ£
Na vida, uma nova canÃ§Ã£o
Cantando sÃ³ teus olhos
Teu riso, tuas mÃ£os
Pois hÃ¡ de haver um dia

Em que virÃ¡s
Das cordas do meu violÃ£o
Que sÃ³ teu amor procurou
Vem uma voz
Falar dos beijos perdidos
Nos lÃ¡bios teus

Canta o meu coraÃ§Ã£o
Alegria voltou
TÃ£o feliz a manhÃ£
Deste amor

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

,We got engaged on a Friday night
,I swore on the head of our unborn child
,That I could take care of the three of us
,But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
,It's in my blood
,She said she might just run away somewhere else
,Some place good
,We can't wait till tomorrow
,You gotta know that this is real baby
,Why you wanna fight it
,It's the one thing you can choose
,Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose
,Ain't we all just runaways?
,I knew it when I met you
,I'm not gonna let you  run away
,I knew it when I held you  I wasn't letting go
,We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
,Hold each other 'til the morning light
,We used to laugh, now we only fight
,Baby are you lonesome now?
,At night I come home after they go to sleep
,Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
,There's a picture of us on our wedding day
,I recognize the groom but I can't settle in these walls
,We can't wait till tomorrow
,Now we're caught up in the appeal,
,Baby why you wanna hide it?
,It's the last thing on my mind
,（you wanna hide ）
,I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
,Ain't we all just runaways?
,I knew it when I met you
,I'm not gonna let you run away
,I knew it when I held you  I wasn't letting go
,
,Ain't we all just runaways?
,Yeah
,Ain't we all just runaways?

,I'm waking up to ash and dust,
,I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,
,I'm breathing in, the chemicals, gahh ahhh.
,I'm breaking in, shaping up,
,then checking out on the prison bus.
,This is it, the apocalypse, woah.
,.
,I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
,Enough to make my systems go
,Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
,Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
,Woah, woah, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

,We will walk in fields of gold

  I'm holding on your rope,
 Got me ten feet off the ground
 And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
 You tell me that you need me
 Then you go and cut me down, but wait
 You tell me that you're sorry
 Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...
 
 That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
 
 I'd take another chance, take a fall
 Take a shot for you
 And I need you like a heart needs a beat
 But it's nothing new - yeah yeah
 
 I loved you with the fire red-
 Now it's turning blue, and you say...
 "Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
 But I'm afraid...
 
 It's too late to apologize, it's too late
 I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late whoa.....

,Do you remember the 21st night of September?
,Love was changing the minds of pretenders
,While chasing the clouds away
,Our hearts were ringing
,In the key that our souls were singing.
,As we danced in the night,
,Remember how the stars stole the night away
,Aaahh Ba de ya - say do you remember
,Ba de ya - dancing in September
,Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
,My thoughts are with you
,Holding hands with your heart to see you
,Only blue talk and love,
,Remember how we knew love was here to stay
,Now December found the love that we shared in September.
,Only blue talk and love,
,Remember the true love we share todayyy yeah

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Making love with you is all I want to do
Loving you is more than just a dream come true
Everything that I do is out of loving you
La la la la la ........
La la la la la ........
Doo doo din doo doo ah
No one else can make me feel the colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime
Loving you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with loving you
Loving you I see your soul come shining through
And every time that we oh I'm more in love with you
,The shadow of your smile
,When you have gone
,Will color all my dreams
,And light the dawn
,Look into my eyes, my love, and see
,All the lovely things you are to me
,A wistful little star
,Was far too high
,A tear drop kissed your lips and so did I
,Now when I remember spring
,All the joy that love can bring
,I will be remembering
,The shadow of your smile
,Now when I remember spring
,All the joy that love can bring
,I will be remembering
,The shadow of your smile

It's better than being a party-poop
Obligato, pizzicato

It's the craziest
When you noodle
With the doodling song
2, 3, 4
Like it so much
I'll doodle some more
Little softer

Even softer

Say you love me
With the doodling song
B, C, D
Oh what you doodle-dee-doo to me
Say you love me
Really love me
Say you love me true
(I love you)
Say you love me
Please believe me
When you do
That makes two who
Go together
Bet your boodle
Like the apples in strudel do
When we noodle
With the doodling song
What you call
A real ball
Say you love me
Really love me
Say you love me true
(I love you)

, I wish you bluebirds in the spring
, to give your heart a song to sing
, And then a kiss but more than this ，
, I wish you love
, And in July a lemonade ，
, to cool you in some leafy glade
, I wish you health but more than wealth ，
, I wish you love
, My breaking heart and I agree
, that you and I could never be
, So with my best my very best ，
, I set you free
, I wish you shelter from the storm ，
, A cozy fire to keep you warm
, But most of all
, when snowflakes fall
, I wish you love
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,
,I've got you under my skin
,I have got you deep in the heart of me
,So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me
,And I've got you under my skin
,I have tried so, not to give in
,I've said to myself this affair it never would go so well
,But why should I try to resist when I know so well
,That I've got you under my skin
,I would sacrifice anything come would might
,For the sake of having you near
,In spite of a warning voice, that comes in the night and repeats in my ear
,Don't you know you fool you never can win
,Use your mentality, wake up to reality
,For each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
,Because I've got you under my skin

,It isn't right each time you pass me by.
,I think I have found heaven on the ground
,But I can't get close to you even when you're around me.

Rosa Passos - É Luxo Só
 
 Olha, esta mulata quando dança
 é luxo só
 
 Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança,
 é luxo só
 
 Tem um nao sei qué
 que faz a confusao
 
 O que ela nao tem, meu Deus
 é compaixao
 Essa mulata quando...
 
 Olha esta mulata quando dança
 é luxo só
 
 Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança,
 é luxo só
 
 Porém seu coração quando se agita
 e palpita mais ligeiro
 Nunca vi compasso táo Brasileiro
 
 Éta samba cai pra lá,
 cai pra cá, cai pra lá,
 Mexe com as cadeiras, mulata
 Seu requebrado me maltrata

,And as the night danced by,

,Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does,
,no heart ever yearned the way mine does,
,for you.
,And yet I know too well.
,Some day you'll say goodbye.
,Then violins will cry and so will I, mam'selle.

,A small cafe mam'selle
,Our rendezvous mam'selle
,The violins were warm and sweet,
,and so were you mam'selle.
,And as the night danced by,
,a kiss became a sigh.
,Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does,
,no heart ever yearned the way mine does,
,for you.
,And yet I know too well.
,Some day you'll say goodbye.
,Then violins will cry and so will I, mam'selle.
,And yet I know too well
,Some day you'll say goodbye
,Then violins will cry and so will I, mam'selle.

Failing in love again
Never wanted to
What am i to do?
Can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it as i may
I was born that way
Can't help it
Men flock around me
Like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn
I know i'm not to blame
I'm falling
Can't help it
,
,I looked at you and suddenly
,Something in your eyes I see
,Soon begins bewitching me
,It's that old devil moon
,That you stole from the sky
,It's that old devil moon in your eyes
,
,You and your glance
,makes this romance too hot to handle
,
,Stars in the night blazin' their light
,can't hold a candle
,To your razzle dazzle
,You've got me flyin' high and wide
,On a magic carpet ride
,Full of butterflies inside
,I just wanna cry
,Wanna croon
,Wanna laugh like a loon
,It's that old devil moon in your eyes
,Just when I think I'm free as a dove
,Old evil moon deep in your eyes
,Blinds me with love

When we're in a friendly situation
My conversation may not be smart
But if we're to have a perfect understanding
Let's call a heart a heart
There are words that should be whispered gently
That's evidently the way to start
If I tell you what my dreams have been demanding
Let's call a heart a heart
Can I prove how I yearn
Just by the turn of a phrase?
Can I keep my control
When all my soul is aflame?
Maybe we'd call a true confession
And in discretion on someone's part
But if I'm to say how madly I adore you
Let's call a heart a heart

,Back at the start
,It was all hearts and flowers
,Candlelight rendezvous
,That lasted for hours
,But since he's gone
,You toss and turn until dawn
,Nobody ever told you
,It would feel like this when
,Each tender dream
,Just seems to fade like dew does
,Your arms keep reaching
,For the lover man who was
,Faithless and mean
,But now he's gone from the scene
,They oughta write a song about that
,About the way it hurts when you realize
,All those promises were false
,About the lonely sound when the music dies
,Like a broken waltz
,If there were prizes
,For those sighs of regret
,You'd be the envy
,Of the "oh, woe is me" set
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,They oughta write a song about that
,Romance is through
,It's just the piper and you
,Oh, they ought to write a song about that
,Somebody somewhere
,Oughta write a song about that

,He knows that I'm there

,The shadow of your smile
,When you have gone
,Will color all my dreams
,And light the dawn
,Look into my eyes, my love, and see
,All the lovely things you are to me
,A wistful little star
,Was far too high
,A tear drop kissed your lips and so did I
,Now when I remember spring
,All the joy that love can bring
,I will be remembering

,Gee, it's great after bein' out late
,Walkin' my baby back home
,Arm in arm, over meadow and farm
,Walkin' my baby back home
,
,We go 'long harmonizing a song
,Or I'm recitin' a poem
,Owls go by and they give me the eye
,Walkin' my baby back home
,
,We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
,And snuggles her head on my chest
,We start into pet and that's when I get
,Her talcum all over my vest
,
,After I kinda straighten my tie
,She has to borrow my comb
,One kiss, then I continue again
,Walkin' my baby back home
,
,She's 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park
,Outside of her door, till it's light
,She says, if I try to kiss her she'll cry
,I dry her tears all through the night
,
,Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
,Right from her doorway we roam
,Eats and then it's a pleasure again
,Walkin' my baby, talkin' my baby
,Lovin' my baby, I don't mean maybe
,Walkin' my baby back home
,
Fish got to swim and birds got to fly
I got to love one man 'til I die
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
When he goes away
That's a rainy day
And when he comes back that day is fine
The sun will shine
He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

,By all the stars above.
,And now you call it madness,
,But i call it love.
,My heart is beating,
,It keeps repeating for you constantly.
,You're all i'm needing
,And so i'm pleading,
,Please come back to me.

,Who knows the answers? Who do you trust?
,I can't even separate love from lust.

,Maybe I’ll move back home and pay off my loans,
,working nine to five answering phones.
,Don't make me live for my friday nights,
,drinking eight pints and getting in fights.

,I don't want to get up, just let me lie in,
,leave me alone, I'm a twenty something.

,there surely must be more. Ooooh

,Baby, it's cold outside
,This evening has been so very nice
,Been hoping that you'd drop in
,I'll hold your hands
,They're just like ice
,My mother will start to worry
,Beautiful, what's your hurry?
,My father will be pacing the floor
,Listen to the fireplace roar
,So really I'd better scurry
,Beautiful, please don't hurry
,But maybe just a half a drink more
,I'll put some records on while I pour
,The neighbors might think
,Baby, it's bad out there
,Say, what's in this drink?
,No cabs to be had out there
,I wish I knew how
,Your eyes are like starlight
,To break this spell
,I'll take your hat
,Your hair looks swell
,I ought to say no, no, no, sir
,Mind if I move in closer?
,At least I'm gonna say that I tried
,What's the sense in hurting my pride?
,I really can't stay
,Baby, don't hold out
,Baby, it's cold outside
,Uh, you're very pushy, you know?
,I like to think of it as optimistic
,I simply must go
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The answer is no
,Baby, it's cold outside
,The welcome has been so nice and warm
,How lucky that you dropped in
,Look out the window at that storm
,My sister will be suspicious
,Gosh, your lips look delicious
,My brother will be there at the door
,Waves upon a tropical shore
,My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
,Gosh, your lips are delicious
,But maybe just a cigarette more
,Never such a blizzard before
,And I don't even smoke
,I've got to get home
,Baby, you'll freeze out there
,Say, lend me your coat
,It's up to your knees out there
,You've really been grand
,I thrill when you touch my hand
,But don't you see
,How can you do this thing to me?
,There's bound to be talk tomorrow
,Think of my life long sorrow
,At least there will be plenty implied
,If you caught pneumonia and died
,I really can't stay
,Get over that hold out
,Baby, it's cold
,Baby it's cold outside

,Tonight will end so soon
,There are moments

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me now

,I'd like to order something cool

,Yes, I'd like something cool

,You know it's a shame
,I can't think of your name
,I remember your smile
,
,I don't ordinarily drink with strangers
,I guess I usually drink alone
,But you were so awfully nice to ask me
,And I'm so terribly far from home
,
,Like my dress I must confess it's very old
,But it's simple and neat, it's just right for this heat
,Save my furs for the cold
,A cigarette, no I don't smoke them as a rule
,But I'll have one, it might be fun with something cool
,
,I'd bet you wouldn't imagine that I once had a house
,With so many rooms you couldn't count them all
,I'll bet that you couldn't imagine I had fifteen different boys
,Who would beg and beg to take me to a ball
,
,And I know you couldn't picture me
,The time I went to Paris in the fall
,And who would think the man that I loved
,Was quite so handsome and quite so tall
,
,Well, it's through, it's just a memory I had
,One I almost forgot since the weather's so hot
,And I'm feeling so bad about a date, oh wait, I'm such a fool
,He's just a guy who stopped to buy me something cool

,I know I could always be good
,Someone who'll watch over me

  I am not such a clever one about the latest fads
 I admit I was never one adored by local lads
 Not that I ever tried to be a saint
 I’m the type that they classify as quaint
 
 I’m old fashioned, I love the moonlight
 I love the old fashioned things
 The sound of rain upon a window pane
 The starry song that April sings
 This years fancies are passing fancies
 But sighing sighs, holding hands
 These my heart understands
 
 I’m old fashioned but I don’t mind it
 That’s how I want to be
 As long as you agree
 To stay old fashioned with me.

 As long as you agree
 To stay old fashioned with me.

,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seems to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh I'd love to climb to mountain, reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh I'd love to go out fishing in a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

,But it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh I'd love to go out fishing in a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek

Though some may reach for the stars
Others will end behind bars
What the future has in store no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn
Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years from drifting by even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving

In some hotel with you
Safe until they find us
Hoping they never do
How'd you get me caught
up in this burning affair
So far away from home
(Pause)
I don't care
(Pause)
You and me in Paris
Free to be who we are
Prisoners of desire
How'd it get this far
(Pause)
People say you're dangerous
But, what do they know
When you are close to me
(Pause)
Can't say no
(Pause)
I can hardly breathe
Lovin you so much
Always on the run
Runnin outta time
And I'm scared that
this could end
What if they should
follow us to Paris
Caution to the wind
Savor every touch
Every night is blessed
Every kiss a rush
(Pause)
All We have is Paris
Here we could disappear
No-one needs to find us
Lost in the shadows here
We could be invisible
Hidden from view
Promise me that's enough
(Pause)
Just me and you
(Pause)
I can hardly breathe
Lovin you so much
Always on the run
Runnin outta time
And I'm scared that

Caution to the wind
Savor every touch
Every night is blessed
Every kiss a rush

,Everytime we say goodbye,
,I wonder why a little,

,As the new night comes along bringing new light
,She knows her loneliness will go away for a while
,And slowly she will close her eyes thinking of him
,Of the stranger she meets in her dreams
,He'll come alone to her from out of the shadows
,And brighten up the stars always so dim
,He’ll lead her to a dance in the moonlight
,Then she’ll kiss him like she never did
,And the music will go on
,And she won't be alone
,She leaves her nightly dreams with abandon
,She likes to feel the rain on her skin
,She doesn't know his name, never asked him
,'cause he takes her where she’s never been
,They’ll be walking on the streets of a new world
,There'll be no familiar places, no one they know
,Only they will fill up all of the spaces with emotion
,It's her dream, and she knows he'll be gone soon
,Soon, soon, soon
,When she opens up her eyes
,The lover of her life
,She leaves her nightly dreams with abandon
,She likes to feel the rain on her skin
,She doesn't know his name, never had to
,'cause he takes her where she wants to be
,They’ll be walking on the streets of a new world
,There'll be no familiar places, no one they know
,Only they will fill up all of the spaces with emotion
,It's her dream, and she knows he'll be gone soon
,When she opens up her eyes
,He'll be there right by her side
,The stranger in the morning,her lover in the night
,When you were very young,
,the world was younger than you,
,As merry as a carousel,
,The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky,
,Above the ring I loved so well.
,Now the young world has grown old,
,gone are the silver and gold,
,Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,
,Old girl, you're through.
,Just sit there and count your little fingers,
,unlucky little girl blue.
,Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you,
,It's time you knew,
,All you can count on are the raindrops that
,fall on little girl blue.
,No use, old girl, you might as well surrender,
,Your hopes are getting slender,
,Why won't somebody
,send a tender blue boy to cheer up little girl blue.

,It's you who walks through the door every night
,It's you who can smile and light up my life
,It's true that you make me complete
,I could find happiness in a bottle of wine
,I could sing every night in room full of strangers
,Who don't really know me the way you do
,It's you who believes I can do anything
,It's you who feels my heart and makes me who I am
,It's true that you be here for me

,Or if the sun shines bright
,I just might miss you
,Not in there
,I don't miss you
,Till the morning fills the air

,Or the evening light is barely there
,I don't miss you

,above above the perfect midnight sky
,I don't miss you
,Till the morning fills the air

,I'm asking him to change his ways
,And no message could have been any clearer
,If you wanna make the world a better place
,Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
,(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

,And a washed-out dream

,There was something different about this girl
,The way she moved her hair her face her lines
,Divinity in motion As she stalked the room
,I could feel the aura of her presence every head turned feeling passion and lust
,the girl was persuasive the girl I could not trust
,The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous
,I never knew but I was walking the line
,come go with me I said I have no time
,She said don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
,My baby cried and left me standing alone She's so dangerous.
,The girl is so dangerous take away my money throw away my time
,You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me
,She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
,I feel trapped into her web of sin a touch a kiss a whisper of love
,I was at the point of no return
,Deep in the darjness of passion's insanity I felt taken by lust's stranger, inhumanity
,the girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
,The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous
,I never knew but I was living in vain
,She called my house and said you know my name
,And don't you pretend you never did me before with tears in her eyes
,My baby walked out the door She's so dangerous
,The girl is so dangerous take away my money throw away my time
,You can call me honey but you're no damn good for me
,DANGEROUS The girl is so dangerous.
,I have to pray to god cause I know how lust can blind
,It's a passion in my soul but you're no damn lover friend of mine

,I cannot sleep alone tonight, my baby left me here tonight
,I cannot cope 'til it's all right
,You and your mainpulation you hurt my baby
,And then it happened she touch me
,For the lips of a stranger woman, drop as a honey-comb
,And her mouth was smooth than oil but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sward

 ﻿É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um caco de vidro, é a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte, é o laço, é o anzol

É peroba do campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá, candeia, é o MatitaPereira
É madeira de vento, tombo da ribanceira
É o mistério profundo, é o queira ou não queira

É o vento ventando, é o fim da ladeira

É a viga, é o vão, festa da cumeeira
É a chuva chovendo, é conversa ribeira
Das águas de março, é o fim da canseira

É o pé, é o chão, é a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão, pedra de atiradeira
É uma ave no céu, é uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão

É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto o desgosto, é um pouco sozinho
É um estrepe, é um prego, é uma ponta, é um ponto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um conto

É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manhã, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada

É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato, na luz da manhã

São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé

São as águas de março fechando o verão,
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terçã

São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração.

,Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
,From glen to glen, and down the mountain side

,Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
,'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
,Oh Danny boy, Danny boy, I love you so.
,
,And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
,And I am dead, as dead I well may be
,You'll come and find the place where I am lying
,And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
,And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
,And all my dreams will warmer and sweeter be
,If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
,I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
,I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
,I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

,诞生日には カトレアを忘れない
,やさしい人だったみたい けれど おしまい
,夜更けの电话 あなたでしょう
,话すことなど何もない
,Making Good Things better
,爱は消えたのよ 二度とかけてこないで
,疲れ果てたあなた 私の まぼろしを爱したの

,M-ai mințit cu vorbele
,Mi-ai aflat secretele
,Și, ca un hoț, ai intrat sub pielea mea
,inRead invented by Teads
,Știi, de-o vreme, fetele
,Fetele, cochetele
,Nu mai pot, da' tu, da, sub pielea mea
,Și știi
,Eu te rog să nu faci prostii
,Eu nu-s prost
,Dar mă tem, cumva
,De tine, de mine, de noi
,Pentru că tu ești
,Sub pielea mea
,Op, eroina
,Op, op, eroina
,Op, eroina mea
,Op, eroina
,Op, op, eroina
,Op, eroina mea
,M-ai mințit cu vorbele
,Mi-ai schimbat hotarele
,Ce folos au armele
,Când este pe repeat doar cadrul cu ochii tăi
,Fusta până la genunchi
,Și mâneci lungi, se-ascund
,Ce dragoste ai vrea
,Dar mărul e mușcat și între noi e doar ea
,O rupeai, te rupea, te rupeai, tu
,Sub pielea mea
,Op, eroina
,Op, op, eroina
,Op, eroina mea
,Op, eroina
,Op, op, eroina
,Op, eroina mea
,Op, eroina
,Tu să nu-mi dai iubire
,Iubirea ta nu ține
,Nu ține cont de inimi
,Pe care le-a rănit
,Atât de rău
,Și op, eroina
,Op, op, eroina

,Do you recall, not long ago
,We would walk on the sidewalk
,Innocent, remember?
,All we did was care for each other
,But the night was warm
,We were bold and young
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,What will we do when we get old?
,Will we walk down the same road?
,Will you be there by my side?
,Standing strong as the waves roll over
,When the nights are long
,Longing for you to come home
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun

,Que cela puisse paraitre
,J'ai écrit au départ
,Pour combattre mon mal-être
,Je me suis battu pour y'arriver
,Mettant entre parenthèses ma vie privée
,Et même si cela était le prix à payer
,Jamais je ne le regretterai
,Et tout le monde
,Lè lè lè lève les mains en l'air
,Moi j'ai choisi la musique car je préfère l’atmosphère
,Des boites de nuit, de la foule et des salles de concert
,Je ne suis qu'un saltimbanque
,Pourtant je vise le top
,Lè lè lè lève les mains en l'air

,Lè lè lève lè lè lève
,Lève les mains en l'air
,
,Tout le temps passionné
,Difficilement impressionné
,Pour mon public j'ai tout donné
,Et j'n'ai jamais abandonné
,Même si les galères tu connais
,Tache de ne pas déconner
,Car tu ne peux même pas soup?onner
,Ce que la vie peut te donner
,Non je n'vais pas changer
,Le monde avec des paroles
,Parce que je n'suis ni tes parents
,Ni ton maitre d'école
,Je ne suis pas un exemple
,Et encore moins une idole
,J'veux juste que ton moral décolle
,Lè lè lè lève les mains en l'air

,Первый Куплет:
,Ты на танцполе врывалась, телом манила меня.
,Я поглощаю текилу, сегодня я - тамада.
,Горели наши бокалы, мы снова на кураже.
,Но всё же мне тебя мало, baby, балла,
,Алкоголь, party-бомба, е!
,Движняк мой, пожелай мне лес, рой!
,Прошепчу пароль:
,"Я свой на этом празднике души."
,А ну-ка, наливай, бортовой!
,Телами танцпол кишит и между нами будто искрит,
,А мы на баре с пацанами кому-либо наливаем.
,Налетай, пока горит.
,Кому не лень!
,поднимаем руки,Суки, все сюда!
,Солнце погасло и пропала тень, уснули города.
,Но в этом океане мы до утра тусим, хватило бы сил.
,Подхожу к тебе, чтобы спросить:
,- Ты мне дашь слово, ты мне дашь, ты мне, ты мне дашь.
,- Ты мне дашь слово, ты мне дашь, ты мне, ты мне дашь.
,- Ты мне дашь слово, ты мне дашь, ты мне, ты мне дашь.

,Второй Куплет:
,Эта толпа просит ей подпевать,
,А на празднике жизни пора зажигать!
,Танц-пол горит, штакет дымит
,Девушки знают, кто тут залип.
,Руку в небо, ноги в пляс!
,Этот движняк - сердца на бас.
,А я ман-дураман, зажигай бэйба-пуля
,Модные шкуры, глаза Питбулей!
,Тут в анаболике жопы трясутся!
,Тело моё, тут жаркая туса!
,Словно подарок небес накачай.
,Dj вернулся! Ритм им задай!
,С ночи до утра подай бит голова!
,Хватит стесняться, иди сюда!
,Дай мне слово, ведь, я - тамада!
,Тама-тамада!
,Руки вверх, моя кавабанга!
,У входа пусто, внутри моя банда,
,Любишь эти стили? Люби и тела!
,Кайфую с тёлок, в чём мать родила!
,Слепит светом, а я раггатон.
,Собираем толпы, мой Вавилон!
,Ты мне дашь слово, ты мне дашь!

,And all I can do is watch and cry
,I miss the air,I miss my friends

,But that was a million years ago
,Million years ago
,When I walk around all of the streets
,Where I grew up and found my feet
,But they don't look me in the eyes
,It's like they scared of me
,I try to think of things to say
,Like a joke, or memory
,But they don't recognize me now

,Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
,Once I was seven years old
,It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
,Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
,By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
,Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
,Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
,Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
,Once I was eleven years old
,I always had that dream like my daddy before me
,So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
,Something about that glory, just always seemed to bore me
,Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
,Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
,Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
,Once I was twenty years old.once I was twenty years old
,Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
,We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
,Soon we'll be 30 years old
,I'm still learning about life
,My woman brought children for me
,So I can sing them all my songs
,And I can tell them stories
,Most of my boys are with me
,Some are still out seeking glory
,And some I had to leave behind
,My brother I'm still sorry
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
,Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
,Soon I'll be 60 years old
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
,Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
,Soon I'll be 60 years old

Olmadı seninle bir yastıkta kocayamadık
Olmadı seninle birlikte ah nefes alamadık
Ne sevgi ne saygı var artık aşkı var artık
Herşey yarım yamalak kaldı
Tadını çıkara çıkara aşk yaşayamadık
Seninle bu sevgimiz yandı
Günahıma girersin bu böyle olmaz
Ağzından çıkanı kulağın duymaz
Dediklerin hiç birbirini tutmaz
Saçmala yavrum saçmala
Hadi yine, yine, yine saçmala
Ağzından çıkanı duymasın
Ben daha ne diyeyim sana
Saçmala yavrum saçmala
Hadi yine, yine, yine saçmala
Sen zaten hiçbir zaman gelmezsin ki imana
Sen hiç ağlayan adam gördün mü
Görmediysen bak beni ne hale soktun
Elini hiç vicdanına koydun mu
Koymadıysan gözlerime dal yavrum
Günahıma girersin bu böyle olmaz
Ağzından çıkanı kulağın duymaz
Dediklerin hiç birbirini tutmaz
Saçmala yavrum saçmala
Hadi yine, yine, yine saçmala
Ağzından çıkanı duymasın
Ben daha ne diyeyim sana
Saçmala yavrum saçmala
Hadi yine, yine, yine saçmala
Sen zaten hiçbir zaman gelmezsin ki imana
Saçmala yavrum saçmala
Hadi yine, yine, yine saçmala
Ağzından çıkanı duymasın

Deli dolu değilim ben aslında
Benimde bir kalbim var severim
Arada sırada buz gibi olurum
Gerekirse eğer acısını ben çekerim
Sensiz olmuyor fark ettim
Seni bir daha üzmem canım
Arada sırada buz gibi olurum
Gerekirse eğer acısını ben çekerim
İlk defa ben birine yandım
Biranda kendimi mecnun sandım
Olumsuzca sözler etme söyletme şimdi beni
Ben senin ananın ellerinden öpeceğim
Allah' ın emri ile isteyeceğim
Eğer bana kızıpta asla olmaz derse
İnan bu dünyayı yakarım bebeğim
Ben senin ananın ellerinden öpeceğim
Allah' ın emri ile isteyeceğim
Eğer bana kızıpta asla olmaz derse
İnan bu dünyayı yakarım bebeğim
Kıvrana kıvrana geldim güzelim yandım bittim
Sensiz ahlar çektim aç kollarını
Yanıyorum hep sen aaaa dört duvar arasında
Geceleri bir yatıkta dalsak rüyalara
Rüya gerçek olacak
Ben senin ananın ellerinden öpereğim
Allah ın emriyle isteyeceğim
Eğer bana kızıp ta asla olmaz derse
İnan bu dünyayı yakarım bebeğim
Ben senin ananın ellerinden öpeceğim
Allah ın emriyle isteyeceğim
Eğer bana kızıp ta asla olmaz derse
İnan bu dünyayı yakarım bebeğim

Ne güneş yakar nede ateş beni
Ne yağmur nede rüzgar söndürür bu ateşi
Kapını açık tut canım geliyorum
İnan seni ölesiye seviyorum
Bilki yarim ben senin ben senin
Ben senin ananın ellerinden öpeceğim
Allah' ın emriyle isteyeceğim
Eğer bana kızıp ta asla olmaz derse
İnan bu dünyayı yakarım bebeğim
Eğer bana kızıp ta asla olmaz derse

bu kadar nazlanma aklım fikrim sende
bak beni bitirdin
çok tatlı tatlısın çok ama tatlı tatlısın
aklımı aldın sen şeytanmısın
çok tatlı tatlısın çok ama tatlı tatlısın
aklımı aldın sen şeytanmısın

Kendini yine bana tattirmadin
O yüzüne doya doya baktirmadin
Seni siki siki siki sarilmadin
Aman aman aman aman birakmadin, ahh
Ama gidiyorsun hersey yarina kaldi
Gec kaldim diyorsun günah be icim yandi
Tutsan ellerimi ne olur kirma beni
Hic olmazsa, hic olmazsa, bir kere, bir kere
Ver ver, bir dudak ver, ver ver o yanaktan ver
Utanirsan cekinirsen gözlerini kapativer
Ver ver, bir dudak ver, ver ver o yanaktan ver
Utanirsan cekinirsen gözlerini kapativer

Hemen hemen hemen söndür
Hemen hemen hemen söndür
Ateşin çıktı söndür söndür söndür söndür
Hemen hemen hemen söndür
Hemen hemen hemen söndür
Hadi kendini bana mu mu mu öptür
Her yerim yanıyor ateşimi söndür
Bitiyorum ah yanıma yaklaş
Rengim benzim soldu bu yüzümü güldür
Çaktırmadan yavaşça gel bana
Yanıyorum amanın alev alev ben sana
Hadi düşür beni eline diline yavrum
Tütüyorum of nefesinle soğut beni
İstersen kandır beni
Yalan masallarla uyut beni
Kandıra kandır ısır hadi güzelim kandır
Kandıra kandır ısır hadi güzelim ısır
Yanağından öptür beni
hemen hemen hemen söndür
Ateşin çıktı söndür
Perdeleri indir kapıları örttür ateşimi dindir dindir
Söndür söndür söndür lambalari söndür atesimi söndür söndür

Şiir Bugün senin doğum günün mü değil mi
Tüm sevdiklerin mi yanında mutlu musun
O sahte dostlarınla yeni sevgilinle el ele göz göze
Bir zamanlar benim de gözlerimin içine bakarak
Seni seviyorum demiştin
Bir zamanlar benimle de aynı şeyleri paylaşıp
Benden vazgeçemiyeceğini söylemiştin
Bırakır mı seven nedensiz sevdiğini
Kaybeder mi özleyen bilerek hasretini
Ben de kandırmışım ya kendimi
Bir anda telefon başında bıraktın beni -

Verdiğin acılar unutulmadı

Katlanan yüreğim dayanmadı
Kahroldum inan bitmişim
Bunu sen istedin
Bugün senin doğum günün
Gözlerinde yok hiç gözüm
Sana mutluluklar dilerim sanma
Doğum günün haram olsun
Göz yaşların zehir olsun
Her günün işkenceyle dertlerle dolsun
Bu sözlerim yalan sana
Bırakıpta ağlatana
Hayat seni yerlerden yerlere vursun

Hayatım mutsuz gözlerim uykusuz
Bedenim ruhsuz kalır
Yüreğime koyduğun acıları besledim ayrı ayrı
Bugün bugün benim ölüm günüm
ben bu acılar için mi yaratıldım be gülüm
Duygularına inandım meğerse hepsi sahte bir de kendine iyi bak diyorsun
Yok ulan vurdun be zaten kahpe ne olduysa seni sevdim beni bıraktın öyle bir başıma
Ben de seni günahlarımla baş başa bıraktım bir daha bir daha çıkma karşıma
Akl?ma gelir birden
Hic beklemedigim bir anda anidenat the time i dont even expect,suddenly
An?lar kopmaz benden
Beni aglatan onlar an?lar zaten


 
S?ms?k? sar?lmalar
S?ms?cak bak?smalar
Her yerde hayalin var
Soyle senden nas?l bu can kopsun ya

Seviyorum her seyim sensin
Vazgecemem beni sen bilirsin
Seviyorum neden mi dersin
Senden baska sevilecek biri mi var

Aglar?m birden
Gozlerim doluyor aniden
Yuregimde s?z?
Kalbimde bin ac? ozlemekten
Sen benim can?ms?n
Hasretim ask?ms?n
Her yerde hayalin var
Dinmeyen ac?m yarams?n

Seviyorum her seyim sensin
Vazgecemem beni sen bilirsin
Seviyorum neden mi dersin
Senden baska sevilecek biri mi var

Siir:
Kim bilir ne hallerdesin
Kim bilir hangi kose bucak bir yerdesin
Yalvarsam kosup yan?ma gelir misin
Beni eskisi gibi sever misin
Pismanl?g?m? gorup gozlerime bak?p affeder misin
Sensiz bir olu gibiyim gulum desem
Doner misin, doner misin!

Ne kadar basit bu, ne kadar saçma bu
Ne kadar igrenç bu yalanların
Aman benden uzak kal
Neyin varsa hemen al
Zaten olmuş banal sevgin, aşkın
O yalan gözlerle gözlerime bakma
Çık artık dünyamdan boşuna yanma
Tatlı masallarla uyuttun beni
Beni de kaybettin alamazsın geri
Yanıma gelme yar istemiyorum seni
Bir daha tövbe Allah korusun ay ay
Kim bilir sen daha kimleri yakarsın
Benden sonra sana gelene vay vay
Yanıma gelme yar istemiyorum seni
Bir daha tövbe Allah korusun ay ay
Kim bilir sen daha kimleri yakarsın
Benden sonra sana gelene vay vay

Sarıl bana can bırakma beni
Üzme seven bu yüreğimi
Ne olur bu aşkımızı öldürmeyelim
Yazık günah denir buna
Bitirmeyelim
Söyle bunu sen nasıl yaparsın
Bütün hayallerimi nasıl yıkarsın
Öyle güzel günler yaşamıştık
Bunları sen unutamazsın
Ben sana çokmu geldim
Yoksa bir hata mı ettim
Ne olursun sevgilim
Bu aşkımızı öldürmeyelim
Seni mutlu edebilmek için gözbebeğim gibi sevdim
Senden bu güne kadar hiç birşey istemedim
Ama ilk defa birşey istiyorum
Yar gitme ben sensiz yaşayamam
Yar gitme gözbebeğimsin dayanamam
Dur gitme seviyorum unutamam
Yar gitme içimdesin atamam
Canım, aşkım, bitanem, herşeyim seni çok seviyorum
Sen olmazsan ben ne yaparım ben sensiz yaşayamam ki
Bak bak daha gitmeden yıkıldı dünyam
Sevenlere hep kıyarlar kıyıpta acımazlar
Ne olur sende onlardan olma sarıl bana canım
Sen gidersen yaşayamam sensiz hayatta olamam bak gitmeden
Yıkıldı dünyam
Sevenlere hep kıyarlar kıyıpta acımazlar
Ne olur sende onlardan olma beni yanlız bırakma
Yar gitme ben sensiz yaşayamam
Yar gitme gözbebeğimsin dayanamam
Dur gitme seviyorum unutamam
Yar gitme içimdesin atamam
Söyle söylediklerim gerçek mi
Seven insan hiç terk eder mi
Hani severdin, hani beklerdin
Canım diyen o sen değilmiydin
Sevgilim seni çok özlüyorum
Canımdan daha çok seviyorum
Sen benim herşeyimsin
Diye söyleyen sen değilmiydin
Sen olmazsan yaşayamam ki
Sensizliğe dayanamki
Senden asla ayrılmam
Diye ağlayan sen değilmiydin
Sevenlere işte böyle kıyarlar
Seviyorum diye aldatırlar
Ne olur sende onlardan olma
Sarıl bana canım
Yar gitme ben sensiz yaşayamam
Yar gitme gözbebeğimsin dayanamam
Dur gitme seviyorum unutamam
Yar gitme içimdesin atamam

Benim için hep sen vardın
Bunu hep senden senden duyardım
İki gözüm kör olsun
Of nasıl sana inandım
Bin cefa gördüm
Bin defa öldürdün
Kahrolsun bıktım ya artık
Beni benden aldın attın
Beni sattın yazıklar olsun
2x
Allah belânı versin
Allah seni kahretsin
Bana gelen sana gelsin yaaa
Hayatımı sen mahfettin
Acımadın neler çektim
Kader seni de kör etsin
Bomboş yere yaşıyorum
Hergün acı çekiyorum
Her dakika eriyorum
Yeter artık senden nefret ediyorum
Beni benden aldın attın
Beni sattın yazıklar olsun
Allah belânı versin
Allah seni kahretsin
Bana gelen sana gelsin yaaa
Hayatımı sen mahfettin
Acımadın neler çektim

İsterse ölüm gelsin
Hala seviyorum seni
Allah belânı versin
Allah belânı versin
Allah seni kahretsin
Bana gelen sana gelsin yaaa
Hayatımı sen mahfettin
Acımadın neler ettin
Allah seni de kör etsin

Cıldırdım aklım yok hayatımın anlamı kalmadı şimdi

,Həm çox çəkib acı, yaralar açıq göynədər,
,Xoş bir gün görmədən, uçmağa min nədən,
,Yerdə yer saxlamaz onu, göydə göydələn.
,Onu eşidən, duyar var son sözü ümid son ölər.
,Onun saçları son bahardır,
,Ömrü iztirab, dörd divardır,
,O, tərki-dünyadır anlamam halından.
,O, günəş kimi yandırardı,
,Yazda yağışdır, yayda qardır,
,Kim bilir nələr keçib gedir ağlından...
,Onun sözləri ittihamdır,
,Onun gözləri intihardır,
,Bəlkə onda ağrılar çıxar canından...

,Ona yaddır doğmalar, yaxınlar baxar uzaqdan,
,Süzülər yerə damla-damla yaş axar yanaqdan.
,O mənsiz qalınca o mənsiz yarımcan,
,Ucaldan təkcə bir məqam - öpüş dodaqdan.

, В твоих глазах я вижу свои мысли.
,И дождь поет на ломаном английском.
,Наверно, мы попали в зону риска.
,Слишком, слишком, быстро, быстро.
,И без тебя мой мир теперь немыслим.
,Бояться больше не имеет смысла.
,Ты попадаешь в сердце, словно выстрел.
,Слишком, слишком, быстро, быстро.
,Твои глаза такие чистые, как небо.
,Назад нельзя, такая сила притяженья.
,Твои глаза, останови это движенье.
,Я для тебя остановлю эту планету.
,Запутались мы в городах и числах.
,Нет никого на свете, только мы с ним.
,Неловкое молчание повисло.
,Слишком, слишком близко, близко.
,Я не знаю как так вышло, ты говоришь.
,А я внезапно стала от тебя зависима.
,В твоем плену, а смысл?
,Бежать бессмысленно видимо, видимо, видимо.
,Твои глаза такие чистые, как небо.
,Назад нельзя, такая сила притяженья.
,Твои глаза, останови это движенье.

, Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
, This ship went down in sight of land

, But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique

,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption
,I planned each charted course
,Each careful step along the byway
,And more, much more than this
,I did it my way
,Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew
,But through it all, when there was doubt
,I ate it up and spit it out
,I faced it all and I stood tall
,I did it my way
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried
,I've had my fill; my share of losing
,And now, as tears subside
,I find it all so amusing
,To think I did all that
,And may I say - not in a shy way
,"No, oh no not me"
,I did it my way"
,For what is a girl, what has she got?
,If not herself, then she has naught
,To say the things She truly feels

The morning sun when I'm asleep with you right next to me
The coffee machine ain't working,
but I see you've got the kettle boiling
You know I know quietly so
that u're the one for me
'cause u're the one for me

,
Love is like a never-ending melody,
Poets have compared it to a symphony,
A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon,
But our song of love is slightly out of tune.

Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch,
Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich,
Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing,
Like the bossa nova, love should swing.

*We used to harmonize two souls in perfect time,
Now the song is diff'rent and the words don't even rhyme,
'Cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon,
And so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune?

**Tune your heart to me the way it used to be,
Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving.
We're bound to get in tune again before too long,
There'll be no desafinado When your heart belongs to me completely,
So you won't be slightly out of tune, You'll sing along with me.

You'll sing along with me.

,轻言漫话 谁在意有多真实
,不要认真的思索 让快乐变得简单
,风翻过骤雨勿尔下降
,餐馆泡沫咖啡烫热了
,不需要缘伞子庇护我
,大树下蓝雾渐散街角的灯光柔和
,何时预约在炎夏 提着白花登上山
,看天边的小鸟 经过河岸边际
,单车 在两畔鱼贯而过
,走遍 多少处明媚窄巷
,诙谐逗话 从未去区分真实
,不要太多的追究 是快乐已很简单
,清早去弄个精致便当
,公园里摘了花送赠我
,只需要下午天朗日照
,清风里来骑木马哼唱出歌声悠扬
,何时合照在檐下 黏在绿色木门下
,踏遍一地黄菊花
,风光到处全是美 该去观赏
,每站过站 来到终点
,车厢里是我一个

,这次你走我发白日梦半天
,谁人来电也觉没特别意思
,只得我自己不可以么
,以后随时停电再怕黑亦没法子
,无聊时烫衫
,愿望共你一起蒸发
,随洗衣机转完又转是你的肥皂泡
,好想亲你就跳进被窝
,身心浸浴甜梦里渴望未曾天光
,渴睡最好不过时间任我拖
,幸福相恋感觉在这刻纯属幻觉
,music
,幸福不应挥霍就当教我学会去
,爱上茶道喷喷香水换被单
,无聊时挂画换旧地毯玻璃洗擦
,谁知新居太难习惯没有你随时喊
,以后有谁来分享晚餐
,热水炉怎关
,画面看得再入神色彩不吸引
,以前有你抱我看电视这刻又再好
,珍惜你　又跳进被窝
,心好挂念才后悔那日没情可讲
,是我天生小器撞跌了唱机
,要修补不生气尽快打电话给你

'Cause I don't know
Where to lock for love
I just don't know how
Oh girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be

They say let the woman
Take care of you

And think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place
Oh, yeah
Don't know where to go
Who to see
Oh girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself
A lot of useless tears
Girl, I gotta get away from here
Oh girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know
Where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how
Oh yeah

Better be on my way
I can't stay, yeah

Dear Ella 
Our Special First Lady of Song 
You gave your best for so long 
This is true 

Dear Ella we're all so glad 
You answered the call 
For it is certain that your music 
Will always stand tall 
Your blessing to all 

Dear Ella 
The soul in your songs 
And heart we can feel 
Such feeling, emotion 
Such beauty of phrase 
Each time 
You brought joy to so many 
With sounds of the music sublime 

You started so early and 

Made it so fun 
With hard work and talent 
You became number one 

With your bearing so regal 
Your voice strong and true 
You gave us a standard 
Met only by a few 

Dear Ella 
We'll always remember 
Your love and good will 
We treasure the place 
In our hearts that you fill 

We love you 
We thank you 
For all that you are 
Ella... in our hearts 
You are a true 

Shining star... 

Dear Ella.

,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue
,I see the life I never had before
,Do you remember when
,We used to live things separate
,We hadn't met or thought
,That could be possible
,I'm glad you had your life
,So good to listen to your past
,All of those things brought you
,With me and now we're two
,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue
,I see the life I never had before
,You always talk so smooth
,And in your voice, so true
,I hear the dream
,I never had before
,But if I try to think Of something better than this
,Heaven comes down
,And reminds the luck we live
,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue

Vamos a dejar que pase esta tormenta de soledad
Que la lluvia caiga a calmar la sed
De este suelo seco loco por beber
Que la lluvia caiga sin piedad
Que borre la tristeza de tu mirar
Que inunde los rincones de tu pesar
Que entre en nuestra casa, déjala
Déjala, déjala.
No cierres las ventanas
Deja que la lluvia llegue hasta a mi almohada
Que arruine cortinas y cubiertas
Que encharque los geranios y la mesa puesta
Que ahogue las preguntas sin repuestas
Que vuele los papeles y promesas
Que el cielo se oscurezca durante la siesta
y duerma hasta que pase esta tormenta
Déjala
Que la lluvia ya sabrá cuando parar
Que la lluvia sabe más
Y vamos a dejar
Que entre la marea en el jardín
Despeine las palmeras y el jazmín
Y se lleve con ella este sufrir
Déjala, déjala, déjala, déjala...

Picture you upon my knee, 
Just tea for two and two for tea,
Just me for you
And you for me alone.
Nobody near us
To see us or hear us,
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations.
We won't have it known, dear,
That we own a telephone, dear; 
Day will break and you'll awake 
And start to bake a sugar cake, 
For me to take
For all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, 
A boy for you, a girl for me.
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be? 

Connie Talbot - Winter Wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire

Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's Charlie Brown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until all the other children knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland,

,Beneath the awning of a famous cafe

,In a language neither of us understand
,While we argue about the customs of the land

,While your blase comments drive me half insane
,I want to dash for shelter with you through the tropical rain
,I wish I could go travelling again
,I want to be awakened by a faulty fire alarm
,In an overpriced hotel devoid of charm
,Then fall asleep again back in your arms
,I wish I could go travelling again

,Bur how can I ever go travelling again
,When I know I'll just keep remenbering again
,When I know I'll just be gathering again
,Reminders to break my heart

Se você disser que eu desafino amor
Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor
Só privilegiados têm ouvido igual ao seu
Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu
Se você insiste em classificar
Meu comportamento de anti-musical
Eu mesmo mentindo devo argumentar
Que isto é bossa-nova, isto é muito natural
O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente
É que os desafinados também têm um coração
Fotografei você na minha Roleiflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão
Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor(assim do meu amor)
Que é o maior que você pode encontrar
Você com sua música esqueceu o principal
Que no peito dos desafinados
No fundo do peito bate calado
Que no peito dos desafinados Também bate um coração

Ménilmontant mais oui madame
C'est là que j'ai laissé mon cœur
C'est là que je viens retrouver mon âme
Toute ma flamme
Tout mon bonheur...
Quand je revois ma petite église
Où les mariages allaient gaiement
Quand je revois ma vieille maison grise
Où même la brise
Parle d'antan
Elles me racontent
Comme autrefois
De jolis contes
Beaux jours passés je vous revois
Un rendez-vous
Une musique
Des yeux rêveurs tout un roman
Tout un roman d'amour poétique et pathétique
Ménilmontant!
Quand midi sonne
La vie s'éveille à nouveau
Tout résonne
De mille échos
La midinette fait sa dînette au bistro
La pipelette
Lit ses journaux
Voici la grille verte
Voici la porte ouverte
Qui grince un peu pour dire \"Bonjour bonjour
Alors te v'là de retour?\"
Ménilmontant mais oui madame
C'est là que j'ai laissé mon cœur
C'est là que je viens retrouver mon âme
Toute ma flamme
Tout mon bonheur...
Quand je revois ma petite gare
Où chaque train passait joyeux
J'entends encor dans le tintamarre
Des mots bizarres
Des mots d'adieux
Je suis pas poète
Mais je suis ému,
Et dans ma tête
Y a des souvenirs jamais perdus
Un soir d'hiver
Une musique
Des yeux très doux les tiens maman
Quel beau roman d'amour poétique
Et pathétique
Ménilmontant!

  You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
 You ain't never been blue
 Till you've had that mood indigo
 That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
 While I just sit here and sigh
 Go along blues
 
 I always get that mood indigo
 Since my baby said goodbye
 And in the evening when the lights are low
 I'm so lonely I could cry
 For there's nobody who cares about me
 I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
 When I get that mood indigo
 I could lay me down and die
 
 You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
 You ain't never been blue
 Till you've had that mood indigo
 That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
 While I just sit here and sigh
 Go along blues

,
From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl,
My heart says follow trough.
But I know, now, that Im way down on your line,
But the waitin feel is fine:
So dont treat me like a puppet on a string,
cause I know I have to do my thing.
Dont talk to me as if you think Im dumb;
I wanna know when youre gonna come - soon.
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love,
cause if summer is here,
Im still waiting there;
Winter is here,
And Im still waiting there.

Its been three years since Im knockin on your door,
And I still can knock some more:
Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more.
In life I know theres lots of grief,
But your love is my relief:
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While Im waiting - Yes Im waiting for my turn,


I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;
I dont wanna wait in vain for your love;

When you touch my hand my feelin' start to show

,Six years old
,Staring at my nose in the mirror
,Trying to dip my toes in the mirror
,Thinking 'Who's that girl?'
,And 'Does the mirror world go on forever?'
,Calmly you roll
,Sharpening the knives in the attic
,Trying to watch cartoons through the static
,Thinking where am I gonna be
,If I'm ever twenty-three? Oh
,I'm looking at a life unfold
,Dreaming of the green and gold
,Just like the ancient stone
,Every sunrise I know
,Those eyes you gave to me
,That let me see
,Where I come from
,Found an old friend
,Meeting my guitar in the city
,Feeling like a star in the city
,And suddenly it seems that I'm where I'm supposed to be, oh
,And now I'm fully grown
,And I'm seeing everything clearer
,Just sweep away the dust from the mirror
,We're walking hand in hand on the warm white sands
,I'm looking at a life unfold
,Dreaming of the green and gold
,Just like the ancient stone
,Every sunrise I know
,Those eyes you gave to me
,That let me see

,
,Just when I thought I could changed
,I end up falling again
,It's something I just can't fight
,Heartbroken time after time
,Don't even know why I try
,I must me out of my mind
,I don't know why
,I keep putting myself though it, why
,I'm so obsessed, I can't even sleep
,Every time it cuts me so deep
,Don't know why, But I still believe,
,I'll find the one
,But I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,And even though I can't stand the pain
,I'll still do it again
,Till I find what I'm looking for
,But I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,Praying to God everyday
,Hoping my luck's gonna change
,Then maybe I'll get my turn (I'll get my turn)
,But I know,
,Soon as I fall she'll be gone
,Don't know what I'm doing wrong
,It seems like I'll never love
,I don't know why
,I keep putting myself though it, why
,I'm so obsessed
,I can't even sleep
,Every time it cuts me so deep
,Don't know why
,But I still believe
,I'll find the one
,But I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,And even though I can't stand the pain
,I'll still do it again
,Till I find what I'm looking for
,But I hate falling in love
,It's getting harder
,Each and every time I try (try try try)
,I'm losing my faith
,But I gotta have it in my life (life life)
,But I just can't deny it
,The more I try to fight it
,The more I want it so bad
,I hate falling in love
,But I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,I hate falling in love
,And even though I can't stand the pain
,I'll still do it again

Bajando la ladera
Por el camino viene bailando
Arrastra la sandalia
La polvareda va levantando
Moviendo la cintura
Y las caderas como ninguna
Tiene la piel morena
Sonrisa clara
Color de luna
Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra!
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna
Arrastra la sandalia
LlÃ©vame en tu locura
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna
La noche es una niÃ±a
Que va pasando, que va creciendo
La mÃºsica no para
Sigue bailando, se va encendiendo
El sudor de su cuerpo le pone brillo a su piel canela
La blusa colorada, la madrugada y esa morena
Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna
Arrastra la sandalia
LlÃ©vame en tu locura
Baila morena, baila
Que tÃº lo bailas como ninguna

,Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
,Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
,A young girl with eyes like the desert
,It all seems like yesterday, not far away
,Tropical the island breeze
,All of nature, wild and free
,This is where I long to be
,La isla bonita
,And when the samba played
,The sun would set so high
,Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
,You Spanish lullaby
,I fell in love with San Pedro
,Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
,Te dijo te amo
,I prayed taht the days would last
,They went so fast
,Tropical the island breeze
,All of nature, wild and free
,This is where I long to be
,La isla bonita
,And when the samba played
,The sun would set so high
,Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
,You Spanish lullaby
,I want to be where the sun warms the sky
,When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
,Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
,Where a girl loves a boy
,And a boy loves a girl
,Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

,Starry, starry night
,Paint your palette blue and grey
,Look out on a summer's day
,With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
,Shadows on the hills
,Sketch the trees and the daffodils
,Catch the breeze and the winter chills
,In colors on the snowy linen land
,Now I understand
,What you tried to say to me
,And how you suffered for your sanity
,And how you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they did not know how
,Perhaps they'll listen now
,Starry, starry night
,Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
,Swirling clouds in a violet haze
,Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
,Colors changing hue
,Morning fields of amber grain
,Weathered faces lined in pain
,Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
,Now I understand
,What you tried to say to me
,How you suffered for your sanity
,How you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they did not know how
,Perhaps they'll listen now
,For they could not love you
,But still your love was true
,And when no hope was left in sight
,On that starry, starry night
,You took your life, as lovers often do
,But I could've told you, Vincent
,This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
,Starry, starry night
,Portraits hung in empty halls
,Frameless heads on nameless walls
,With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
,Like the strangers that you've met
,The ragged men in ragged clothes
,The silver thorn on the bloody rose
,Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
,Now I think I know
,What you tried to say to me
,And how you suffered for your sanity
,And how you tried to set them free
,They would not listen, they're not listening still
,Perhaps they never will

,Я не близок, не далёк - ровно, как и ты мне.
,Дым кружится в потолок по пустой квартире
,И последний фитилёк гаснет в моём мире.
,Осенний туман в твоих глазах
,Развеял обман, и сердце в прах
,Мне больше не жаль: себя, тебя -
,Сгорела душа, потух пожар.
,Говорят, что сердце знает; ну а время, - лечит.
,Нас куда-то унесёт Королева Вечность.
,Ты ушла из моих снов, только шаль на плечи.

It looks like I'm saying
I love you Maria
In the photograph here
We're looking so happy
I call you I'm loco
And I confess my love
To the machine
How funny if there is
A new love in the scene
I see you beside me
I love you, remember
It looks like December
A long golden lost year
It's like a Bolero
Te quiero, te quiero
To say that I long for
Your kisses never more
Tus besos nunca mas
...forget you Maria
In this photograph here
I love you forever
I call you and breathless
I leave all my confusion in the machine
Oh how disconcerting would be
To see my love again
I see you through wet eyes
Insane eyes, December
But when I remember
The long golden lost years
I still sing te quiero
Bolero our rhymes are so banal
Oh how I still long for
Tus besos never more
Tus besos nunca mas

,Barbra Streisand - You Must Believe In Spring
,
,When lonely feelings chill
,The meadows of your mind,
,Just think if Winter comes,
,Can Spring be far behind?
,Beneath the deepest snows,
,The secret of a rose
,Is merely that it knows
,You must believe in Spring!
,
,Just as a tree is sure
,Its leaves will reappear;
,It knows its emptiness
,Is just the time of year
,The frozen mountain dreams
,Of April's melting streams,
,How crystal clear it seems,
,You must believe in Spring!
,
,......
,You must believe in Spring
,You must believe in love
,And trust it's on its way,
,Just as the sleeping rose
,Awaits the kiss of May
,
,So in a world of snow,
,Of things that come and go,
,Where what you think you know,
,You can't be certain of,
,You must believe in Spring and love

C'est si bon 
 De partir n'importe où 
 Bras dessus bras dessous 
 En chantant des chansons 
 C'est si bon 
 De se dir'des mots doux 
 Des petits rien du tout 
 Mais qui en disent long 
 
 En voyant notre mine ravie 
 Les passants, dans la rue, nous envient 
 
 C'est si bon 
 De guetter dans ses yeux 
 Un espoir merveilleux 
 Qui me donne le frisson 
 C'est si bon 
 Ces petit's sensations 
 Ça vaut mieux qu'un million 
 Tell'ment, c'est bon 
 
 C'est si bon 
 De pouvoir l'embrasser 
 Et puis de r'commencer 
 A la moindre occasion 
 
 C'est si bon 
 De jouer du piano 
 Tout le long de son dos 
 Tandis que nous dansons 
 
 C'est inouï ce qu'elle a pour séduire 
 Sans parler de c'que je n'peux pas dire 
 C'est si bon 
 Quand j'la tiens dans mes bras 
 De me dir'que tout ça 
 C'est à moi pour de bon 
 C'est si bon 
 Et si nous nous aimons 
 Cherchez pas la raison 
 C'est parc'que c'est si bon 
 C'est parc'que c'est si bon 
 C'est parc'que c'est... trop.... bon
,Look at me,
,I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
,And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud,
,I can't understand
,I get misty,
,just holding your hand
,
,Walk my way
,And a thousand violins begin to play
,Or it might be the sound of your hello
,The music I hear,
,I get misty the moment you're near
,
,You can't  say that you're leading me on,
,But it's just what I want you to do
,Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost,
,That's why I'm following you
,
,On my own,
,Would I wander through this wonderland alone
,Never knowing my right foot from my left,
,My hat from my glove
,I'm too misty, and too much in love.

  It begins to tell,
 'round midnight, midnight.
 I do pretty well, till after sundown,
 Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
 But it really gets bad,
 'round midnight.
 
 Memories always start 'round midnight
 Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
 When my heart is still with you,
 And ol' midnight knows it, too.
 When a quarrel we had needs mending,
 Does it mean that our love is ending.
 Darlin' I need you, lately I find
 You're out of my heart,
 And I'm out of my mind.
 
 Let our hearts take wings'
 'round midnight, midnight
 Let the angels sing,
 for your returning.
 Till our love is safe and sound.
 And old midnight comes around.
 Feelin' sad,
 really gets bad
 Round, Round, Round Midnight 

This day and age we're living in
Gives cause for apprehension
With speed and new invention
And things like fourth dimension
Yet we get a trifle weary
With Mr. Einstein's thory
So we must get down to earth at times
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress
Or what may yet be proved
The simple facts of life are such
They cannot be removed
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
Well, it's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Oh yes, the world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh
(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile - but she doesn't see (doesn't see)

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listened as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead!
,Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,Missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,Once you'd gone there was never,
,never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People couldn't believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever wanna be king?
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,Missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)

,I hear the bell go Ding Dong
,Deep down inside my heart
,Each time you say  kiss me
,Then I know it's time for Ding Dong to start
,Each time you say hug me
,Ding Dong Ding Dong
,Each time you say love me
,Ding Dong Ding Dong
,I hope I don't wait too long
,To hear my bell go Ding Dong
,
,明明是冷冷清清的长夜
,为什么还有叮叮当当的声音
,听不出是远还是近
,分不出是梦还是真
,原来是一串铃
,打乱了我的心
,
,窗外不再有凄凄切切的幽灵
,只听到喜鹊儿齐鸣
,今夜的轻风 吹来了第二春
,又把消失的夜莺吹醒
,
,I hear the bell go Ding Dong
,Deep down inside my heart
,Each time you say kiss me
,Then I know it's time for Ding Dong to start
,Each time you say hug me
,Ding Dong Ding Dong
,Each time you say love me
,Ding Dong Ding Dong
,I hope I don't wait too long
,To hear my bell go Ding Dong
,It's knowin' that your door is always open
,And your path is free to walk
,That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
,Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
,And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
,By forgotten words and bonds
,And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
,That keeps you in the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
,It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
,And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
,Or something that somebody said
,because They thought we fit together walkin'
,It's just knowing that the world
,Will not be cursing or forgiving
,When I walk along some railroad track and find
,That you're movin' on the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,Planted on their columns now that bind me
,Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
,And the junkyards and the highways come between us
,And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
,'cause she turned and I was gone
,I still might run in silence
,Tears of joy might stain my face
,But not to where I cannot see You
,walkin' on the back roads
,By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
,by dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
,And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
,In some train yard
,My beard a rustlin' coal pile
,And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
,Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
,I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
,That you're waitin' from the back roads
,By the rivers of my memory
,Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

The Shadow Of Your Smile
- Matt Monro

One day we walked along the sand,
one day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
to mend its broken wing
Now I'll remember many a day
and many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song,
The shadow of your smile

The shadow of your smile
when you are gone
The color on my dreams
and light the dawn
Look into my eyes
my love and see
All the lovely things
you are to me

Our wistful little star
was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
and so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy and love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

And now when I remember spring
All the joy and love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
,The gates of Heaven must be open
,I think I saw an angel just walk by
,Hey, the gates of heaven must be open
,I think I saw an angel just walk by
,I heard a blind man screamin', say

,There goes a sight for my sore eyes

,From the beginning to the end
,He was no more than a friend to me
,
,The thought is makin' me hazy
,
,I think I better sit down
,
,Cause like the sweetest serenade
,
,Bet he knows he's got it made with me
,
,Twisting round on a carousel
,
,This speeds' too much to stop
,
,One second I'm thinkin' I'm feeling the lust
,And then I feel a lot
,
,That man is like a flame
,And ooh that man plays me like a game
,My only sin is I can't win

,Now it's like I'm on a mission
,
,Headed everywhere
,And if it takes a little long
,And it feels a little wrong who cares?
,My baby fits the description
,And does it easily
,
,A little Gable, some Astaire
,When he dances I can hardly breathe
,
,Someone call a doctor
,
,Need some help to rescue me
,One second I'm thinkin' I must be lost
,
,And he keeps on findin' me

,
,The clock has ticked eleven and the place is clear
,Reality is kicking in and so is my beer
,I don't make excuses when it's all my fault
,If a heart is made of money he's cleaned out my vault
,I feel a little wounded and it isn't fair
,To sit inside a parlour and see him standing over there
,As smug as a robber that a cop can't catch
,The lipstick on his collar doesn't seem to match mine
,
,Now Joe behind the bar is offering advice
,
,Cause I'm a broken record and he has to tell me twice
,Why don't I understand that he just can't change
,
,I wanna be his woman not his weekend dame
,
,Now Joe has eyes a'rollin' says it's just too bad
,
,And he'll be back tomorrow for my heartbeat crash
,
,I'd like to say goodbye, but hello is the match
,
,Though the lipstick on his collar never seems to match mine
,
,This line is disconnected

,You must remember this
,A kiss is still a kiss
,A sigh is just a sigh
,The fundamental things apply as time goes by
,And when two lovers woo
,They still say "I love you"
,On that you can rely
,No matter what the future brings,
, as time goes by
,Moonlight and love songs never out of date
,Hearts full of passion,
,jealousy, and hate
,Woman needs man,
,and man must have his mate
,That no one can deny
,Its still the same old story
,A fight for love and glory
,A case of do or die
,The world will always welcome lovers
,as time goes by
,
,Someone to hold me tight
,That would be very nice
,Someone to love me right
,That would be very nice
,Someone to understand
,Each little dream in me
,Someone to take my hand
,And be a team with me
,
,So nice, life would be so nice
,If one day I'd find
,Someone who would take my hand
,And samba through life with me
,
,Someone to cling to me
,Stay with me right or wrong
,Someone to sing to me
,Some little samba song
,Someone to take my heart
,And give his heart to me
,Someone who's ready to
,Give love a start with me
,
,Oh yes, that would be so nice
,should it be,you and me
,I could see , it would be nice
,
,Someone to cling to me

Too young to go steady, too young
I hear him (her) say.
He (she) says I'm (we're) not ready
But then why am I (are we) feeling this way?
Too young so he (she) tells me
He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?
Can't he (she) realize he (she) drive me wild
Is he (she) made of stone?
Must he (she) always treat me (act just) like a child?
Won't he (she) ever own up
I'm (we're) grown up?
Some day he'll (she'll) be sorry
Some day just wait and see
He'll (she'll) wish he'd (she'd) gone steady with me!

Though some may reach for the stars
Others will end behind bars
What the future has in store no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn
Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years from drifting by even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn

Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend
Marilyn Monroe
hyq1307
,The French are glad to die for love
,They delight in fighting duels
,But I prefer a man who lives
,And gives
,Expensive jewels
,A kiss on the hand may be quite Continental
,But diamonds are a girl's best friend
,A kiss may be grand
,But it won't pay the rental
,On your humble flat
,Or help you at the automat
,Men grow cold
,As girls grow old
,And we all lose our charms in the end
,But square-cut or pear-shaped
,These rocks don't lose their shape
,Diamonds are a girl's best friend
,Tiffany's. . . Cartier. . .
,Black frost. . .
,Pearl 'bossed. . .
,Talk to me, Harry Winston, tell me all about it!
,There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
,But diamonds are a girl's best friend
,There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer
,Thinks you're awful nice
,But get that ice
,Or else no dice
,He's your guy when stocks are high
,But beware when they start to descend
,Cos that's when those louses
,Go back to their spouses
,Diamonds are a girl's best friend
,I've heard of affairs which are strictly Platonic
,But diamonds are a girl's best friend
,And I think affairs that you
,Must keep Masonic
,Are better bets
,If little pets get big baguettes
,Time rolls on, and youth is gone
,And you can't straighten up when you bend
,But stiff back, or stiff knees
,You stand straight at Tiffany's
,Diamonds, diamonds. . .
,I don't mean rhinestones
,Diamonds. . .
,Are a girl's best. . . best friend
E vem do verde aquele dom
Que a vida traz sem te cobrar
E com azul tem branco mar
Laranja doce vem do céu
Com cor de rosa e lilás
Pássaro preto voa triste
Se esse canto se acabar
Do sorriso vem a verdade
Que pode te curar
Respeito à todas as cores
Que a vida te brindar
Ter sempre clara a vida
Pránunca machucar
Só ter na face aquela
Doçura de criar
E vem do verde aquele dom
Que a vida traz práte curar
E com azul tem branco vivo
Tem coral naquele mar
E do vermelho tem brinquedo
Que abra porsas prásonhar
Com amarelo na janela
Vivo olhar práte cegar
Do sorriso vemá(coro)

,Let them know that I'm glad to go
,Death is no dream,
,For in death I'm caressing you
,With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

,And to reach the highest peak,
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.

Oh the shark babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack knife has old MacHeath, babe
And he keeps it out of sight

You know when the shark bites
with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, uh huh, huh
Oh, Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life
Someone's sneaking round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the knife?

There’s a tug boat, uh huh, huh huh
Down by the river, don’t you know
Where a cement bag’s just a-drooping on down
Oh that cement is just, it’s there for the weight, dear
Five will get you ten ol’ Macky’s back in town

Now d’ya hear about Louis Miller
He disappeared babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy did something rash?

Now Jenny Diver, huh huh, yeah Sookie Taudry
Ooh Miss Lotte Lenya, and old Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky’s back in town

I said Jenny Diver, woah, Woah Sookie Taudry
Look out Miss Lotte Lenya, and old Lucy Brown
Yes the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky’s, back in town

Look out old Macky’s back!

,That you make up for all that you lack
,It don't make no difference
,Escaping one last time
,It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
,Oh this glorious sadness that brings
,Me to my knees
,
,In the arms of the angel
,Fly away from here
,From this dark cold hotel room
,And the endlessness that your fear
,You are pulled from the wreckage
,Of your silent reverie
,You're in the arms of the angel
,May you find some comfort here

,Some say love it is a river
,That drowns the tender reed.
,Some say love it is a razor
,That leaves your soul to bleed.
,Some say love it is a hunger
,An endless aching need.
,I say love it is a flower
,And you it's only seed.
,It's the heart afraid of breaking
,That never learns to dance.
,It's the dream afraid of waking
,That never takes the chance.
,It's the one who won't be taken
,Who cannot seem to give,
,And the soul afraid of dyin'
,That never learns to live.
,When the night has been too lonely
,And the road has been too long,
,And you think that love is only
,For the lucky and the strong,
,Just remember in the winter
,Far beneath the bitter snows
,Lies the seed that with the sun's love
,In the spring becomes the rose.

,There’s a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
,Some where Over The Rainbow skies are blue，
,And the dreams that you dare to dream
,Really do come true.
,Someday I’ll wish upon a star
,And wake up where the clouds are far behind me，
,Where troubles melt like lemon drops，
,A way， above the chimney tops
,That’s where you’ll find me.
,Some where Over The Rainbow bluebirds fly，
,Birds fly Over The Rainbow，
,why then， oh why can’t I?

,Spinning, laughing,dancing
,To her favorite song
,A little girl with nothing wrong
,Is all alone
,Eyes wide open
,Always hoping for the sun
,And shell sing her song to anyone
,That comes along
,Fragile as a leaf in autumn
,Just fallin to the ground
,Without a sound
,Crooked little smile on her face
,Tells a tale of grace
,Thats all her own
,Fragile as a leaf in autumn
,Just fallin to the ground
,Without a sound
,Spinning, laughing, dancing
,To her favorite song
,Shes a little girl with nothing wrong
,And shes all alone
,A little girl with nothing wrong
,And shes all alone
,I can't remember what I planned tomorrow
,I can't remember when it's time to go
,When I look in the mirror
,Tracing lines with a pencil
,I remember what came before
,
,I wanted to think there was endless love
,Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
,In the dead of the night I found out
,Sometimes there's love that won't survive
,
,New York City
,Such a beautiful disease
,New York City
,Such a beautiful,
,Such a beautiful disease
,
,Laura kept all her disappointments
,Locked up in a box behind her closet door
,She pulled down the blinds and listened to the thunder
,With no way out from the family store
,We all told her things could get better
,When you just say goodbye
,I'll lay awake one more night
,Caught in a vision I want to deny
,
,And did I mention the note that I found
,Taped to my locked front door
,It talked about no regrets
,As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor
,I rode the train for hours on end
,And watched the people pass me by
,It could be that it has no end
,Just an action junkie's lullaby
,
,
,We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
,As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
,Caught up in the whole illusion
,That dreams never pass us by
,Came to a tattooed conclusion
,That the big one was knocking on the door
,What started as a mass delusion
,Would take me far from the place I adore
,
,You're my beautiful
,Such a beautiful disease
,
,That's it
,I waited 'til I saw the sun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I left you by the house of fun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,When I saw the break of day
,I wished that I could fly away
,Instead of kneeling in the sand
,Catching teardrops in my hand
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Out across the endless sea
,I would die in ecstasy
,But I'll be a bag of bones
,Driving down the road along
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Something has to make you run
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I feel as empty as a drum
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,Ya no estás más a mi lado corazón
,En el alma solo tengo soledad
,Y si yo no puedo verte
,Qué poder me hizo quererte
,Para hacerme sufrir más
,
,Siempre fuiste la razón de mi existir
,Adorarte para mí era obsesión
,Y en tus besos yo encontraba
,El calor que me brindaba
,El amor y la pasión
,
,Es la historia de un amor
,Como no hay otro igual
,Que me hizo comprender
,Todo el bien' todo el mal
,Que le dio luz a mi vida
,Apagándola después
,?Ay' que vida tan oscura!
,Sin tu amor no viviré

  La Vie En Rose 
 Louis Armstrong 
 
 
 
 
 Hold me close and hold me fast 
 the magic spell you cast 
 this is la vie en rose 
 when you kiss me heaven sighs 
 and tho I close my eyes 
 I see La vie en rose. 
 When you press me to your heart 
 I'm in a world apart 
 a world where roses bloom 
 and when you speak, angels sing from above 
 everyday words seem to turn into love songs 
 give your heart and soul to me 
 and life will always be La vie en rose.

,
You are the sunshine of my life
That why I always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you stay （be） in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning
though I've loved you for a million years
and if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
Whoa
whoa
You are the sunshine of my life
that's why I'll always be around
you are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you
You are the sunshine of my life
that's why I'll always be around
you are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You are the sunshine of my life
（of my life of my life）
（light my fire baby light my fire ）
,i asked her to stay
,But she wouldn't listen
,She left before I had the chance to say
,Oh
,The words that were mend
,the things that were broken
,But now its far too late she's gone away
,Thinking why does this happen to me
,Why does every moment have to be so hard
,It's not over tonight
,Just give me one more chance to make it right
,I may not make it through the night
,I won't go home without you
,The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
,And the noises that she make keep me awake
,Oh
,The weight of things that remain unspoken
,Built up so much it crushed us everyday
,Every night you cry yourself to sleep
,Thinking why does this happen to me
,Why does every moment have to be so hard
,Hard to believe that
,It's not over tonight
,Just give me one more chance to make it right
,I may not make it through the night
,I won't go home without you
,It's not over tonight
,Just give me one more chance to make it right
,I may not make it through the night
,I won't go home without you
,Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
,perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, should not ever let you go oh oh oh
,It's not over tonight
,Just give me one more chance to make it right
,I may not make it through the night
,I won't go home without you
,It's not over tonight
,Just give me one more chance to make it right
,I may not make it through the night
,I won't go home without you
,and I won't go home without you
,and I won't go home without you
,and I won't go home without you
,and I won't go home without you
,Give me a shortcut  show me a way
,
,I just need a side street to your heart
,a faster lane
,
,So I can get closer to the start
,Just a little closer to your heart
,I want to get closer to the start
,Just a little closer
,
,I never felt this
,way before
,My stomach sinks
,down to the floor
,I try to play it cool
,like I ain't a tool
,They say men are dogs
,that explains the drool
,Turning heads with those
,legs and face of yours
,I've never seen such a
,beautiful face before
,Caramel complected  chiropractic
,You got 'em breaking
,neck with all your assets
,MeI'm playing low key like baselines
,I'm in the back like Tito
,Mr  incognito
,You asked mi amigos
,why your friend so emo
,It was at that moment  it got real
,And next thing I'm texting BRB
,A minute later we LOL 'bout an OMG
,You even think the same things too
,I recognize these butterflies  Déjà vu
,
,Give me a shortcut  show me a way
,
,I just need a side street to your heart
,
,a faster lane
,
,So I can get closer to the start
,
,Just a little closer to your heart
,
,I want to get closer to the start
,
,Just a little closer
,It was awkward at that Nas concert
,Guys crowded round you like hounds do
,So you threw your arms around my collar
,The freshest necklace
,I felt like a baller
,And I reciprocated  inundated
,with this feeling so right
,Such a beautiful night  I'll never
,forget the conversations we had
,The one time I didn't mind
,staying out of my lab
,Cause we harmonized with
,the music we made
,You talked about your past
,and how you're afraid
,The hurts that he caused and
,how you escaped
,I confessed my mess you
,expressed how you relate
,Should I  give you space to
,explore options
,Or play the love game and
,let you come stalking
,I'm just joshing  kinda sort of
,Your allure's over my head
,you're my fedora
,
,Give me a shortcut  show me a way
,
,I just need a side street to your heart
,
,a faster lane
,
,So I can get closer to the start
,
,Just a little closer to your heart
,
,I want to get closer to the start
,
,Just a little closer
,
,There's no other place that I'd rather be
,
,With you by my side yes
,we'll drive to the sea
,
,I'll sing you Sinatra
,let's love and be free
,
,No reservations and no minor key
,
,I'll give you my heart if
,you give me yours
,No need to hide it for you I adore
,If you see me shine it's
,your love I glow
,So give me a shortcut
,which nobody knows
,
,Give me a shortcut  show me the way
,
,I just need a side street to your heart
,
,a faster lane
,
,So I can get closer to the start
,
,Just a little closer to your heart
,

,The story started, a made up novel
,With no one in my room
,The story started, a girl with a problem
,And she never saw me around
,It came up sudden，walking normal
,While we tried to conversate
,It stopped me from falling, it help me follow through
,And she never ask me why, the story goes
,We played our rules, we're dancing quiet
,While the storm is raging round
,The candy store, the magic of silence
,And another chance at love
,The made up rules, the man made options
,And a way that we should talk
,We never bothered, we never cared to see
,And we made a life we need
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.
,I want you to stay, around and be with me.
,I want you to stay~
,The story started, a made up calling
,With an awkward rendezvous
,We start off slowly, we stopped off one coffee
,With another long goodbye
,We started talking, we started listening
,And we understood ourselves
,I started to see, that i was not all alone
,And maybe you were here
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.
,I want you to stay, around and be with me.
,I want you to stay~
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.
,I want you to stay, around and be with me.
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.
,I want you to stay, around and be with me.
,I want you to stay~
,That's how the story goes
,And I don't understand why.
,So don't stop now.

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness

That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listened as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead!
,Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,Missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,Once you'd gone there was never,
,never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People couldn't believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever wanna be king?
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,Missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
,Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas please
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me 
LoveGame intuition play the cards with Spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

A little gambling is fun when you're with me 
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in 
moments unforgettable

You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy living
life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road 
get up and go if I knew

That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That may be all I need 
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway 
like branches in a storm
Change the weather still 
together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy living 
life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling
and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you
Find a way to bring myself Back home to you
And you may not know 

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave

That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
Driving slow

Driving slow on sunday morning

And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Woah, Stand by me, stand by me.

,

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me.

Whenever you're in trouble you just stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

站在白沙滩
翘首遥望 情思绵绵
何日你才能回还
波涛滚滚 延绵无边
我的相思泪已干
亲人啊亲人你可曾听见
我轻声的呼唤
门前小树已成绿荫

,Vai minha tristeza
,E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser
,Diz-lhe, numa prece
,Que ela regresse, porque eu não posso Mais sofrer
,Chega, de saudade
,A realidade, É que sem ela não há paz
,Não há beleza
,É só tristeza e a melancolia
,Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai
,Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
,Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
,Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
,Do que os beijinhos que eu darei
,Na sua boca
,Dentro dos meus braços
,Os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
,Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
,Abraços e beijinhos, e carinhos sem ter fim
,Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de você viver sem mim
,Não quero mais esse negócio de você longe de mim...

Je ne voulais pas revenir sur cette plage
Où j'avais été heureuse avec toi
Je ne voulais relevé les yeux
Sur la fenêtre
Où chaque soir nous faisions un voeux
En regardant se coucher le soleil
Je me disais que la mer
Ne serait plus du même bleu
Que le vent n'aurait plus le même parfum
Et que les mouettes lanceraient dans le ciel
Que des cris
Des cris de détresse comme pour un naufrage
Chante la vague
Danse la vague
Coule le sable
De l'amour
Mais j'avais tort
Car c'est à peine si mon coeur a battu un peu plus fort
Quand je suis passé devant notre maison
La mer est toujours d'un bleu profond
Le vent a toujours un goût d'orangers
Et les mouettes crient toujours joyeusement
Dans le ciel de l'oubli
Chante la vague
Danse la vague
Coule le sable
De l'amour
,Io come un albero nudo senza te
,Senza foglie e radici ormai
,Abbandonata così
,Per rinascere mi servi qui
,Non c'è una cosa che non ricordi noi
,In questa casa perduta ormai
,Mentre la neve va giù
,è quasi Natale e tu non ci sei più
,E mi manchi amore mio
,Tu mi manchi come quando cerco Dio
,E in assenza di te
,Io ti vorrei per dirti che
,Tu mi manchi amore mio
,Il dolore è forte come un lungo addio
,E l'assenza di te
,è un vuoto dentro me
,Perchè di noi
,è rimasta l'anima
,Ogni piega ogni pagina
,Se chiudo gli occhi sei qui
,Che mi abbracci di nuovo così
,E vedo noi stretti dentro noi
,Legati per non slegarsi mai
,In ogni lacrima tu sarai per non dimenticarti mai
,E mi manchi amore mio
,Così tanto che ogni giorno muoio anchi'io
,Ho bisogno di te
,Di averti qui per dirti che
,Tu mi manchi amore mio
,Il dolore è forte come un lungo addio
,E in assenza di te
,Il vuoto è dentro me
,Tu mi manchi amore mio
,E mi manchi come quando cerdo Dio
,Ho bisogno di te
,Il averti ancora qui con me
,E mi manchi amore mio
,Così tanto che vorrei seguirti anch'io
,E in assenza di te
,Il vuoto è dentro me
,Grido il bisogno di te
,Perchè non c'è più vita in me
,Vivo in assenza
,In assenza di te

,Yo viviré por darte amor
,Borrando cada dolor,

,Como te amé por vez primera
,Con los anos que me quedan
,Te haré olvidar cualquier error
,No quise herirte, mi amor
,Sabes que eres mi adoración
,Y lo serás mi vida entera.
,No puedo imaginar vivir sin ti
,No quiero recordar como te perdí
,Quizás fué inmadurez de mi parte
,No te supe querer
,Y te aseguro que los anos que me quedan
,Los voy a dedicar a ti
,Hacerte tan feliz
,Que te enamores más de mí
,Yo te amaré hasta que muera
,Cómo comprobar que no soy quien fui

,Que como yo te amé
,Más nadie,
,Te podrá amar jamás

Sol brilhando
E a manhã chamando
Te envolvendo
Até as pontas dos pés
Na esperança de um melhor
Na lembrança, aqui estou
Na esperança de um melhor
Na lembrança aqui estou
Sun is shining
The weather is sweet
Make you want to move
Your dancing feet
To the rescue here I am
Want you to know all
Where I stand
Com arco-íris e a manhã chegando
E se quiser saber tenho luz também
E a esperança de um melhor
E a esperança de um melhor
Sun is shining
And the weather is sweet
Make you want to move
Your dancing feet
To the rescue here I am
Want you to know you all
Where I stand

É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É um caco de vidro
É a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte
É um laço, é o anzol...
É peroba do campo
O nó da madeira
Caingá, Candeia
É o matita-pereira...
É madeira de vento
Tombo da ribanceira
É um mistério profundo
É o queira ou não queira...
É o vento ventando
É o fim da ladeira
É a viga, é o vão
Festa da Cumieira...
É a chuva chovendo
É conversa ribeira
Das águas de março
É o fim da canseira...
É o pé é o chão
É a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão
Pedra de atiradeira...
Uma ave no céu
Uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte
É um pedaço de pão...
É o fundo do poço
É o fim do caminho
No rosto o desgosto
É um pouco sozinho...
É um estrepe, é um prego
É uma ponta, é um ponto
É um pingo pingando
É uma conta, é um conto...
É um peixe, é um gesto
É uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manhã
É o tijolo chegando...
É a lenha, é o dia
É o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana
Estilhaço na estrada...
É o projeto da casa
É o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado
É a lama, é a lama...
É um passo é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato
Na luz da manhã...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É uma cobra, é um pau
É João, é José
É um espinho na mão
É um corte no pé...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É um passo, é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte
É uma febre terçã...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
Pau, Pedra...
Fim do caminho...
Resto de toco...
Pouco sozinho...
Pau, Pedra...
Fim do caminho...
Resto de toco...
Pouco sozinho...
Pedra...
Caminho...
Pouco...
Sozinho...
Pedra...
Caminho...
Pouco...
Sozinho...
Pedra...
Caminho...
É um Pouco.

,Non,pas sur la bouche
,Même si c'est louche
,Puisque ma langue
,A le go?t de ta vertu
,De ton honneur perdu
,Non pas sur les lèvres
,Même si j'en rêve
,Même si je tremble
,Et bien que mon coeur soit nu
,Mon ame est revêtue
,De pudeur et d'impudence
,Sans te faire offense
,Mieux n'vaut pas tenter sa chance
,Rien ne dure
,Au dessus de la ceinture
,Non, pas sur la bouche
,Même sous la douche
,Même si c'est dur
,Je te mordrai c'est promis
,Tous les coups sont permis
,Non, pas sur les lèvres
,Même pas en rêve
,A sang pour s?r
,Ou tu mangeras ton pain gris
,Mon coeur est endur?i
,Ne tire pas sur l'ambulance
,Car de la potence
,Plus rien n'a plus d'importance
,Rien ne dure
,Au dessus de la ceinture
,Non, pas sur la bouche
,Je sais, je touche
,Le fond du lac
,Le temps des cerises est mort
,Le diable est dans le corps
,Non, pas sur les lèvres
,Non c'est pas mièvre
,C'est pas le trac
,Mais je préfère me donner crue
,Sans revers, ni refus
,Rendons nous à l'évidence
,Tout est cuit d'avance
,Mieux n'vaut pas tenter sa chance
,Rien ne dure
,Au dessus de la ceinture
,Non,pas sur la bouche
,Je sais c'est louche
,Puisque ma peau
,A l'odeur de ton odeur
,Au dehors il fait chaud
,Non, pas sur les lèvres
,Jamais de trêve
,Et pas d'assauts
,Le bonheur est dans la pente
,Entre le sol et le ventre
,Entre l'oubli et l'oubli
,Bel oiseau du paradis
,Joue plut?t "jeux interdits"
,Rien ne dure
,Au dessus de la ceinture.

,Elle marche seule dans la nuit sous un ciel de minuit
,En suivant les lampadaires qui s'allument dans la nuit
,Tranquillement elle reprend le même chemin qu'avant
,Les allées qui serpentent jusqu'à l'odéon
,Et dans les vitrines en face, elle se voit passer
,Dans les yeux de marie on voit la vie qui passe
,Le jour plus sombre que la nuit

,Dans une cabine téléphonique
,Elle tente encore de faire son appel transatlantique
,Mais elle tombe sur le son de la tonalité

,Dis moi que si tu es là ce n'est pas juste pour mes jolis yeux
,Dis moi qu'au delà de ça y'a d'autres raisons qui te rendent heureux
,Dis moi si tu aimes biens bien nos paresses et nos matins d'amoureux
,Dis moi que c'est un début mais que tu vois déjà la suite à deux
,Dis moi que je suis la seule que tu n'aies jamais autant désirée
,Je n'ai pas de rendez vous, plus de rencard que j'ai envie d'accepter
,Avec toi c'est évident je suis prête à oublier mon passé
,J'ai toujours aimé charmer mais peu importe s'il n'y a qu'à toi que je plais
,Moi je me dis que c'est toi
,Et je sais que tu y crois
,Tu es celui qui rythme mes bonheurs
,Qui rythme mes humeurs

,Le temps fera l'affaire
,Et toi et moi
,Oh ça ira
,J'aime les airs assurés que tu empruntes aux plus beaux monuments
,Ton regard doux comme un secret tes caresses aux limites de l'indécent
,Tu comprends tous mes silences chacun de mes petits moments d'absence
,Si je vais au paradis j'suis pas sure de voir la différence
,Moi je me dis que c'est toi
,Et je sais que tu y crois

,been feeling suffocated, searching for vindication
,

,these final puzzle pieces, we tried but they're too tight
,but if we ease the pressure, I bet they'll fit just right
,
,sometimes it takes some patience, sometimes it works first try
,but I know that this is worth it, cause this dream's too strong to die

,She's the girl in the corner,
,She's the girl nobody loved.
,But I can't, I can't stop thinking about you everyday,
,And you can't, you can't, you can't listen to what people say.
,They don't know you baby,
,Don't know that you're amazing,
,But I'm here to stay.
,When you lose your way and the fight is gone,
,Your heart starts to break
,And you need someone around now.
,Just close your eyes while I put my arms above you,
,And make you unbreakable.
,She stands in the rain, just to hide it all.
,If you ever turn around,
,I won't let you fall down now.
,I swear I'll find your smile,
,And put my arms above you,
,And make you unbreakable.
,I'll make you unbreakable.
,Cause she's the girl that I never had,
,She's the heart that I wanted bad.
,The song I heard on the radio
,That made me stop and think of her.
,And I can't, I can't, I can't concentrate anymore.
,And I need, I need,
,Need to show her what her heart is for,
,It's been mistreated badly,
,Now her world has started falling apart,
,Falling apart.

,And put my arms above you,
,And make you unbreakable.
,You need to know that somebody's there all the time,
,I'd wait in line, and I hope It's yours.
,Can't walk away 'til your heart knows,
,That it's beautiful.
,Oh, I hope you know, It's beautiful.

,No, stanotte amore
,Non ho piu pensato a te
,Ho aperto gli occhi
,Per guardare intorno a me
,E intorno ha me
,Girava il mondo come sempre
,Gira, il mondo gira
,Nello spazio senza fine
,Con gli amori appena nati
,Con gli amori gli amori gia finiti
,Con la gioia e col dolore
,Della gente come me
,Un mondo
,Soltanto adesso, io ti guardo
,Nel tuo silenzio io mi perdo
,E sono niente accanto a te
,Il mondo
,Non si fermato mai un momento
,La notte insegue sempre il giorno
,Ed il giorno verra
,Un mondo
,il mondo
,non si e’ fermato mai un momento
,La notte insegue sempre il giorno

,It's hard to make sense

,If someone else comes, I'd just sit here listening to the drums
,Previously I never called it solitude
,And probably you know all the dirty shows I've put on
,Blunted and exhausted like anyone
,Honestly I tried to avoid it

,Honestly Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop
,And now all the good kids are messing up.

,And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
,In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
,There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

,When this day is through I hope that I will find

Tanto tiempo disfrutamos de este amor
nuestras almas se acercaron tanto así
que yo guardo tu sabor
pero tú llevas también
sabor a mí.

Si negaras mi presencia en tu vivir
bastaría con abrazarte y conversar
tanta vida yo te di
que por fuerza tienes ya
sabor a mí.

No pretendo ser tu dueño
no soy nada yo no tengo vanidad
de mi vida doy lo bueno
soy tan pobre, qué otra cosa puedo dar.

Pasarán más de mil años, muchos más
yo no sé si tenga amor la eternidad
pero allá, tal como aquí
el la boca llevarás
sabor a mí.

,Valiente y luchadora
,De humilde cuna, aii luna, luna, luna, luna
,Que tortura vive de la calle desafiando a la locura
,Con la piel marcada y con el alma ya sin cura
,Se enfrenta a la vida sin la menor duda

,Aunque sufras no piernas las ganas de amar
,Que la vida hay que sentirl
,De mañana va sin maquillaje, de fingir
,No tiene ganas luego por la noche como siempre
,Se disfraza y sigue su lucha estas cosas pasan
,Si te crees que debes levantar la vida esta pa’ vivirla
,Aunque sufras no piernas las ganas de amar
,Que la vida hay que sentirla
,Si te crees que debes levantar la vida esta pa’ vivirla
,Aunque sufras no piernas las ganas de amar
,Que la vida hay que sentirla
,Y ahora olvida los problemas
,Que ya basta de llorar y sacúdete las penas
,Que ahora toca disfrutar

,What was here now is gone
,Up and down like everyone
,Walked the earth in lonesome cry
,But when the sun comes up
,When the sun comes up
,It will be on your side
,It will be on your side
,To the sound of wheels, all demons die
,Rays of joy, they multiply
,Harmony, you will be my bride
,But when the sun comes up
,I'll let out last breath
,And slumber softly
,Into the death
,My half-breed odyssey
,Your orphan prophecy
,Our destiny, we will not hide
,When the sun comes up

,So you tell me man is an island
,Stuck between sanity and asylum
,When the words you use won't work or fit
,They just hang around and always miss
,Retrace your steps again and again
,Your strength and virtue now coming to an end
,This purgatory, this constant battle
,Pack your bags, wave goodbye to struggle
,If the isolation destroys the worry
,If silence stops you saying sorry
,If the rain comes down and drowns the anxiety
,I'm giving up, I'm sailing to Caldey
,Show me some patience, give me some knowledge
,Show me what saves us, give me some courage
,If I could end with the grace of Leonard Cohen
,Then Caldey is the place, I can hear it calling
,So retrace your steps again
,Your strength and virtue now coming to an end
,This purgatory, this constant battle
,Pack your bags, wave goodbye to struggle
,If the isolation destroys the worry
,If silence stops you saying sorry
,If the rain comes down and drowns the anxiety
,I'm giving up, I'm sailing to Caldey
,If the isolation
,If silence
,If the rain comes down
,I'm giving up, I'm sailing to Caldey

,    Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage,
,  Ou comme cestuy-là qui conquit la toison, Et puis est retourné, plein d'usage et raison,
,  Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son age !
,  Quand reverrai-je, hélas, de mon petit village,
,  Fumer la cheminée et en quelle saison
,  Mais quand reverrai-je, de mon petit village, fumer la cheminée et en quelle saison,

,  Mais quand reverrai-je, de mon petit village, fumer la cheminée et en quelle saison,
,   Mais quand reverrai-je ?
,  Reverrai-je le clos de ma pauvre maison
,  Qui m'est une province, et beaucoup davantage ?
,  Plus me plaît le séjour qu'ont bati mes aïeux,
,  Que des palais Romains le front audacieux,
,  Plus que le marbre dur me plaît l'ardoise fine,
,  Plus mon Loir Gaulois, que le Tibre latin,
,  Plus mon petit Liré, que le mont Palatin,
,  Et plus que l'air marin la douceur angevine.
,  Mais quand reverrai-je, de mon petit village,fumer la cheminée et en quelle saison,
,  Mais quand reverrai-je ?
,  J'ai traversé les mers à la force de mes bras,
,  Seul contre les Dieux, perdu dans les marais
,  Retranché dans une cale, et mes vieux tympans percés,
,  Pour ne plus jamais entendre les sirènes et leurs voix.
,  Nos vies sont une guerre où il ne tiens qu'à nous
,  De nous soucier de nos sorts, de trouver le bon choix,
,  De nous méfier de nos pas, et de toute cette eau qui dort,
,  Qui pollue nos chemins, soit disant pavés d'or.
,  Mais quand reverrai-je, de mon petit village, fumer la cheminée et en quelle saison, mais quand reverrai-je ?
,  Mais quand reverrai-je ?

,动情是容易的 因为不会太久
,远远的 仿佛可以触摸
,留恋是不幸的 因为曾经拥有
,夜夜被思念缠扰着
,
,无奈我们看懂彼此是彼此的过客啊
,爱情是个轮廓不可能私有
,把最初的感动巨细无遗的保留心中
,不容许让时间腐朽了初衷
,
,所以放手 所以隐藏 湿透的袖口
,不要挽留 不要回头 记忆续相守

,快乐是容易的 因为短暂逗留
,不必换算时间磨合
,深爱是残忍的 它不喜新厌旧
,你我 同困在这漩涡

,Don’t build your world around
,volcanoes melt you down
,What I am to you is not real
,What I am to you you do not need
,What I am to you is not what you mean to me
,You give me miles and miles of mountains
,And I’ll ask for the sea
,Don’t throw yourself like that
,In front of me
,I kissed your mouth your back
,Is that all you need?
,Don’t drag my love around

,What I am to you is not real
,What I am to you you do not need
,What I am to you is not what you mean to me
,You give me miles and miles of mountains
,And I’ll ask for what I give to you
,Is just what i’m going through
,This is nothing new
,No no just another phase of finding what I really need
,Is what makes me bleed
,And like a new disease she’s still too young to treat
,What I am to you is not real
,What I am to you you do not need
,What I am to you is not what you mean to me
,What I am to you is not real
,What I am to you you do not need
,What I am to you is not what you mean to me

,From where you are,

,He calls you bluff.
,He is the ace you never thought he played that much.
,And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch.
,You never know if winning this could really be enough.
,Take a look, beyond the moon you see the stars.
,And when you look around, you know the room by heart.

,Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
,I cannot believe it.
,I may never see a night like this.

,Could you ever dream it?
,I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.
,How many times,
,have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes?
,To hear that some one debonaire has just a arrived.
,And opened up to see my world before my eyes.
,That silhouette creates an image on the night I can't forget.
,It has the scent of something special, I can't rest.
,If I resist temptation, oh I know for sure that I will lose the bet.
,I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone.

,Ah lahmlahlah

,I met this girl late last year
,She said don't you worry if I disappear
,I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
,I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
,But then I jump right in
,A week later return
,I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
,But I gave her my time for two or three nights
,Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
,I went away for months until our paths crossed again
,She told me I was never looking for a friend
,Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
,Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
,We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM
,Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
,She's singing
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love
,That heart is so cold
,All over my arm
,I don't wanna know that babe
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love
,I told her she knows
,Take aim and reload
,I don't wanna know that babe
,Ah lahmlahlah
,For a couple weeks I
,Only want to see her
,We drink away the days with a take away pizza
,Before a text message was the only way to reach her
,Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
,Singing out Aretha
,All over the track like a feature
,Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
,But me and her we make money the same way
,Four cities, two planes the same day
,Those shows have never been what it's about
,But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
,I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
,But we should get on a plane
,Or we'll be missing it now
,Wish I'd have written it down
,The way that things played out
,When she was kissing him
,How? I was confused about
,She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love
,That heart is so cold
,All over my arm
,I don't wanna know that babe
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love
,I told her she knows
,Take aim and reload
,I don't wanna know that babe
,Ah lahmlahlah
,on my hotel door
,I don't even know if she knows what for
,She was crying on my shoulder
,I already told ya
,Trust and respect is what we do this for
,I never intended to be next
,But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
,And I never saw him as a threat
,Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
,It's not like we were both on tour
,We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
,And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
,But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
,This is not the way you realize what you wanted
,It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
,All this time God knows I'm singing
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love
,That heart is so cold
,All over my arm
,I don't wanna know that babe
,Ah lahmlahlah
,Don't fuck with my love

,Take aim and reload

,You lit the fire
,Then drank the water
,You slammed that door
,And left me standing all alone
,We wrote the story
,We turned the pages
,You changed the end
,Like everybody said you would
,I should've seen it coming
,It should've sent me running
,That's what I get for loving you
,If I had a time machine
,And if life was a movie scene
,I'd rewind and I'd tell me

,Then it drove me up the wall
,But the higher up you go
,The further you will fall

,My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
,I had to stop for the night
,There she stood in the doorway
,I heard the mission bell
,And I was thinking to myself
,This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
,Then she lit up a candle
,And she showed me the way
,There were voices down the corridor
,I thought I heard them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Plenty of room at the Hotel California
,Any time of year
,Any time of year (background)

,Shes got the Mercedes bends
,Shes got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
,That she calls friends
,How they dance in the courtyard
,Sweet summer sweat
,Some dance to remember
,Some dance to forget
,So I called up the Captain
,Please bring me my wine
,He said
,We havent had that spirit here since 1969
,And still those voices are calling from far away
,Wake you up in the middle of the night
,Just to hear them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California

,We are all just prisoners here
,Of our own device
,And in the masters chambers
,They gathered for the feast
,They stab it with their steely knives
,But they just cant kill the beast
,Last thing I remember
,I was running for the door
,I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
,Relax said the nightman

,Ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
,
,Do you know what's worth fighting for'
,When it's not worth dying for?
,Does it take your breath away
,And you feel yourself suffocating?
,Does the pain weigh out the pride?
,And you look for a place to hide?
,Did someone break your heart inside?
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,When you're at the end of the road
,And you lost all sense of control
,And you're throughts have taken their toll
,When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
,Your faith walks on broken glass
,And the hangover doesn't pass
,Nothing's ever built to last
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,Did you try to live on your own
,When you burned down the house and home?
,Did you stand too close to the fire?
,Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
,from a stone
,When it's time to live and let die
,And you can't get another try
,Something inside this heart has died
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,You and I
,You and I
So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much
Deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
It's not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
You say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
Don't care where I have to run
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
I am in misery
There ain't nobody
Who can comfort me
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
(Girl you really got me bad)
(You really got me bad)
(I'm gonna get you back)
(Gonna get you back)
Not sure if you know this
But when we first met
I got so nervous I couldn't speak
In that very moment
I found the one and
My life had found its missing piece
So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight
What we have is timeless
My love is endless
And with this ring I
Say to the world
You're my every reason
You're all that I believe in
With all my heart I mean every word
So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight
Oooh oh
You look so beautiful in white
So beautiful in white
Tonight
And if a daughter is what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did
Yeah, and when she falls in love, we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the aisle
She'll look so beautiful in white
You look so beautiful in white
So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now til my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight
You look so beautiful in white

Here With Me"
(x Robot Koch)
,Caught in the riptide
,I was searching for the truth
,There was a reason
,I collided into you
,Calling your name in the midnight hour
,Reaching for you from the endless dream
,So many miles between us now
,But you are always here with me
,Nobody knows why
,Nobody knows how and
,This feeling begins just like a spark
,Tossing and turning inside of your heart
,Exploding in the dark
,Calling your name in the midnight hour
,Reaching for you from the endless dream
,So many miles between us now
,But you are always here with me
,Oh inside me
,I find my way
,Back to you
,Back to you
,Calling your name in the midnight hour
,Reaching for you from the endless dream
,So many miles between us now
,But you are always here with me
,Two words
,In your hands
,In your hearts
,It's whole universe
,You are always here with me
,It's always like this, people I know
,read many books and save every dream,
,with all of their hope buried inside, somewhere
,And somewhere a man cries for his love
,a love that is lost, that withered too soon
,with all of his hope buried inside, somewhere
,Shouldn't have to be like that
,......
,So all you can say is we need more time
,to get through the things that need to be said,
,with all our trust buried inside, somewhere
,And even if it takes a lifetime of trust
,to build something strong, what happens to us
,with all our faith buried inside, somewhere
,Shouldn't have to be like that
,......
,Shouldn't have to be like that

  Sitiera mia,
 dime que has hecho
 de nuestro dulce hogar
 Reina que un dia
 fue la alegria
 de todo aquel sitial
 
 Lagrimas vierte
 la sitieria
 que tiende a desolar
 y es por no verte,
 reina que un dia,
 fuiste de aquel lugar
 
 Ya el jilguero se alejo
 de aquel frondoso algarrobo
 y hasta la mata de jobo
 nos da muestras de dolor
 
 La sitiera se ha marchado
 y yo enamorado
 lloro por su amor
 y es para la sitieria
 cual si fuela un dia
 que le falta el sol
 
 Ven sitiera por favor,
 ven conmigo a mi retiro
 y gozaremos de amor
 al son del y el guiro 

Desde el Ecuador hasta Pakistán, aquí al costado de Barcelona
Donde la gente pasa a mirar, porque la tristeza está de moda.
Como sardinas con minifalda, vendiendo el cuerpo comprando almas
No es un pecado si es por el pan, sudar las sabanas del Raval.
Las razas, los rezos, las risas roncas / Los ramos, rameras, las rosas rojas
La rima que rime con remendar / Los ratos rotos en el Raval.
Desde algún Manuel Vásquez Montalbán, hasta un chabón argentino y rasta
Aquí esta toda la humanidad, entre Sant Antoni y las Ramblas
Como un puchero pero de razas, pasa un milagro que nunca pasa
Se besan solos en un zaguán, la marroquí con el Catalán.
Las razas , los rezos, las risas roncas / Los ramos, rameras, las rosas rojas
La rima que rime con resignar / Los ratos rotos en el Raval.
Yo dejé la ruta y encontré un camino
Por las aceras del barrio chino
Hay un poco de luz en esta oscuridad
Es una enciclopedia de la humanidad
Las razas, los rezos, las risas roncas / Los ramos, rameras, las rosas rojas
La rima que rime con respirar / Los ratos rotos en el Raval.
Rogelio, Ronaldo, rodrigo, Roque / Rosario, Rasines, Rashid, René
Roberto, Ramones, Regina, Resco / Reinaldo, Rocio, Raúl, Rubén.
La lucha, los ruidos, la suciedad / la calle, la plaza, la soledad
Te digo, no miento, es la verdad / aquí esta toda la humanidad.

My Way (A Mi Manera)
Paul Potts

El fin muy cerca está, lo afrontaré serenamente,
ya ves, yo he sido así, te lo diré sinceramente
Viví la intensidad y no encontré jamás fronteras
jugué sin descansar y a mi manera.

Jamás viví un amor que para mí fuera importante
tomé solo la flor y lo mejor de cada instante
Viajé y disfruté, no se si más que otro cualquiera
si bien, todo eso fué a mi manera.

Tal vez lloré, tal vez reí,
tal vez gané o tal vez perdí
ahora sé que fuí feliz, que si lloré también amé
y todo fué, puedo decir, I did it my way.

Quizás también dudé cuando mejor me divertía
quizás yo desprecié aquello que no comprendía
hoy sé que firme fuí y que afronté ser como era
y así logré seguir, a mi manera.

Porque ya sabrás que el hombre al fin
conocerás por su vivir
no hay porque hablar, ni que decir,
ni recordar, ni hay que fingir
puedo llegar hasta el final, I did it my way!
Ay niña
Yo te encuentro

나를 미소짓게 하는 바람이
그대의 창가에도 불어 온다면
살며시 입맞춰줘요
내일쯤 다시 내게 돌아 올테니
 
혹시 알고 있나요 지금 내 하루는
그대라는 시계로 돌아가고 있죠
하루에도 몇 번을 바라보는지 몰라요
그대를 그리고 내 마음을
 
바람이 그대 창을 두드린다면
그안에 내 향기가 느껴진다면
천천히 내게로 와요
어둡고 작은 내 밤을 밝혀줘요
 
 
힘든 하루 지나고 긴 어둠이 와도
돌아가는 걸음이 무겁지 않아요
이런 나를 어쩌죠 나조차 두려울 만큼
그대가 커져 버렸어
 
그대가 이런 얘기 좋아한다면
그대가 이런 나를 이해한다면
천천히 내게로 와요
어둡고 작은 내 밤을 밝혀줘요

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and i stare
I know that i'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear lord above
Send back my love
Original lyric
In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and i stare
I know that i'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear lord above
Send back my love

Man shorty, after all this time I thought you was true
Thought you was different
I guess a lie don't care who tell it, listen
I thought we was the same, baby, had the same mind
You and me in game, baby at the same time
Took a while to love you but I had to make you mine
Glad I found someone that's right
But then I started hearin' rumors
And I didn't like their sound
Said you had another life way cross town
Put a lot of honesty and trust into you
Without really thinkin' bout all girls I lied to
Said a lie, I don't care who tell it, baby
All this time I thought you were my lady
Try to be without you but it drives me crazy
There's only thing to do
I gotta let it ride, let it ride, let it ride
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta let it ride, let it ride
That's the only thing that I can do
Maybe I jumped in too fast
I should've took my time
But I was so excited that you wanted to be mine
Girl, I was straight with you
I didn't play no games, stayed true
Even when my boys thought I was a fool
Said a lie, I don't care who tell it, baby
All this time I thought you were my lady
I try to be without you but it drives me crazy
There's only thing to do
I gotta let it ride, let it ride, let it ride
Oh, oh, oh I gotta let it ride, let it ride
That's the only thing that I can do
I gotta let it ride, let it ride, let it ride
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta let it ride, let it ride
That's the only thing that I can do
Said a lie, I don't care who tell it, baby
All this time I thought you were my lady
Try to be without you but it drives me crazy
There's only thing to do
Said I gotta let it ride, let it ride
Oh, oh, oh, I gotta let it ride
Oh, oh, oh, that's the only thing that I can do, ride

,Those fingers in my hair

,'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
,And although, I know, it's strictly taboo
,When you arouse the need in me

,But one I wouldn't switch

,They serve the purpose of changing hydrogen into breathable oxygen.
,And they're as necessary here as the air is, on Earth.
,But I still say, they're flowers.
,If you like...
,Do you sell them?
,I'm afraid not.
,But, maybe we could make a deal.

,
,
, Do some people wind up with the one that they adore
, In a heart-shaped hotel room it's what a heart is for
, The bubble floats so madly will it stay sky-high?
, Hello partner, kiss your name bye-bye
, Ooh sometimes...
, Romantic piscean seeks angel in disguise
, Chinese-speaking girlfriend big brown eyes
, Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
, Hello partner, tell me love can't fail
, And it's you and me in the summertime
, We'll be hand in hand down in the park
, With a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye
, and all the sunshine banishes the dark
, Do some people wind up with the one that they abhor
, In a distant hell-hole room, the third world war
, But all I see is films where colourless despair
, Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
, Ooh sometimes...
, Get up a voice inside says there's no time for looking down
, Only a pound a word & you're talking to the town
, But how do you coin the phrase though that will set your soul apart
, Just to touch a lonely heart
, And it's you and me in the summertime
, We'll be hand in hand down in the park
, With a squeeze and a sigh and that twinkle in your eye
, and all the sunshine banishes the dark
, And it's you I need in the summertime
, As I turn my white skin red
, Two peas from the same pod yes we are
, Or have I read too much fiction?
, Is this how it happens?
, How does it happen?
, Is this how it happens?
, Now, right now
,Reach out and touch faith
,Your own personal Jesus

,when mo one around with I can hear the sound of silence
,when mo one around with I can hear the sound of silence
,Won't you take me away,boy
,Can you hear the sound of silence?
,it's like a chilhood dream an angel was always in my mind
,she appears for a lark on a whim said
,“talk soon”and always soon disappears
,she took me to everywhere
,I want she took me to the west where sands smell salty
,I left you on the beach and let you play,seeing you from far away
,and my affection fot you gets stronger with distance
,seeing you from far away my love for you coming stronger
,say out anything you want and uncontrol
,here with me,my love for you

,when no one around with I can hear the sound of silence
Chorus:
,I was falling fast, so fast from out the sky
,And on the other side of town I wasn't far behind
,They said I can't resist the test for the love
,But ever since we met our hearts just opened up
,oh,who know
,The way this story goes
,Who know,What's going on?
,o_hah,oh,Look at what we started,started

,Only someone like you could really change my life
,And now that I've found the one

,(Verse 1 - Hydroponikz)
,Writer's block, sick of grippin' on this damn pencil
,Messin' with this man's mental. I need to take a break.
,I got simple symptoms of a man, gentle
,Stressing 'cause my fam' miss you. I need to see your face
,On the Grand Central, navigation telling' me to drive slow
,Thinkin' about all of the places I roam and people in my home
,I wanna know why they come and go
,Why I'm getting all these thoughts the piano and the drum evoke
,I'm reminded of the first time we spoke, how you loved the
,First rhyme I wrote, except the curses, but you loved the jokes
,How you told me nights I wasn't actin' right
,Never letting me take some bad advice, we had our fights, but
,It's like your life was meant for you to be my mentor and my guardian
,These feelings that I never want to enter in my heart again
,Are seeping in, I'm weakened, I'm alive but I'm cold
,I imagine you're my passenger, reminisce on the road, back through time
,
,(Chorus - Anika)
,Time, Time Goes By
,Still I cry
,Reminiscing 'bout you
,And at night, I close my eyes
,And ask why
,I have to live without you. (In My Life)
,
,(Verse 2 - Hydroponikz)
,First Michael Jackson passes, now every day I'm askin'
,Why weren't you able to stay?
,Days are only kind of better, so I'm writing you this letter
,Full of things I never got to say.
,First and foremost I love you and that never changes
,When you left, I couldn't gauge it, the pain was outrageous
,But now it's kind of strange, you help me get through the days just
,By thinking of your face and reminiscing through the pages
,Everything I wrote and that I'm saying on them stages
,I'm passionate, I hear your laugh again and little traces
,Of your smile flicker through my closed eyes,
,Wishin' I could nose dive in your heart's ocean and just float by,
,Who knows why I feel the way that I do
,I got more to say but I think that I'll just save it for you
,For that first day we meet again, the stories will be told
,We'll be drivin' through our lives and reminisce on the road, back through time
,
,(Chorus - Anika)
,Time, Time Goes By
,Still I cry
,Reminiscing 'bout you
,And at night, I close my eyes
,And ask why
,I have to live without you. (In My Life)

,
,(Bridge - Anika)
,Reminiscing on the better days, close my eyes and its like I can see your face
,Grandpa always had a joke, I remember like it was yesterday
,Last night when I fell asleep, I dreamed you were here right next to me.
,We were young playing in the street, just kicking it old school like this beat (this beat)
,Best friend always had my back, always real and Im really grateful for that
,Good friends from back in the days, so no one can every, every take your place
,Seems like all my inspiration is moving and leaving and passing on
,Bright stars that inspire me, touch my life and next minute theyre gone

,Feel like a failure

,On s'accorde une deuxième chance
,Rattrapons le temps gaché
,Arrêtons de nous cacher

Belle
C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour
Elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps a jour
Telle
Un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'Enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds
J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
A quoi me sert encore de prier Notre Dame
Oh Lucifer, Oh laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esméralda
Belle
Est-ce le Diable qui s'est incarné en elle?
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le ciel
Elle porte en elle le péché originel,
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel?
Oh Notre Dame, oh laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esméralda
Belle,
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La Demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle?
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et
merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel
J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
A quoi me sert encore de prier Notre Dame
Quel
est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre?
Celui la ne mérite pas d'être sur Terre
Oh Lucifer, Oh laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esméralda
Esméralda

,Mais tout a changé quand
,J'ai compris qu'il parlait de toi
,Mais qu'est-c'que j'ai fait au Bon Dieu?
,Il n'y a eu qu'une seule nuit entre nous deux
,Ne nous approchons plus du feu
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs
,Je t'en supplie laisse-moi t'oublier
,Je ne peux pas lui faire ca
,Ne joue pas avec le danger
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs
,Je t'en supplie laisse-moi t'oublier
,Je ne peux pas lui faire ca
,(Y tu juegas con el peligro)
,Ca fait déjà plus d'une semaine
,Et je n'ai plus trop de tes nouvelles
,N'es tu pas content pour moi?
,Toi qui est mon ami
,Je sens que tu t'éloignes de moi
,A chaque fois que je suis avec elle
,Vos regards ne sont plus les mêmes
,Je deviens parano, toi mon ami
,M'as-tu planté un couteau dans le dos
,Mais qu'est-c'que j'ai fait au Bon Dieu?
,Y'a-t-il eu quelque chose entre eux?
,Notre amitié a-t-elle pris feu?
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs
,Je t'en supplie laisse-moi t'oublier
,Je ne peux pas lui faire ca
,Ne joue pas avec le danger
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs
,Je t'en supplie laisse-moi t'oublier
,Je ne peux pas lui faire ca
,(Y tu juegas con el peligro)
,Amigo, amigo, dis-moi que t'es réglo
,Si je ne le suis pas, que Dieu me jette dans l'fuego
,Alors dis-moi tout et soigne ma parano
,Je l'ai aimé un soir avant que tu lui mettes l'anneau
,Mais pourquoi tu ne me l'as pas dit dans les yeux?
,Parc'que je ne t'ai jamais vu aussi heureux
,Tu es mon frère, plus aucune femme entre nous deux
,Notre amitié m'est plus chère que ses beaux yeux
,Mais qu'est-c'qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu?
,Notre amitié a failli prendre feu
,Plus aucune femme entre nous deux
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs
,Je t'en supplie laisse-moi t'oublier
,Je ne peux pas lui faire ca
,Ne joue pas avec le danger
,No me mirès màs, mirès màs

,C’que tu fais d’moi c’est insensé
,Je n’sais plus sur quel pied danser
,Tout comme les stations de métro
,Pour toi je n’suis qu’un numéro
,Tu me rends ouf, tu m’pousses à bout
,T’as manqué tous nos rendez-vous
,Tu m’as donné tellement de coups
,Que je vais finir KO debout
,J’comprends pas j’suis dépassé
,C’que tu fais c’est déplacé
,Cette nuit où t’étais passée ?
,Là c’est trop
,Moi j’abandonne
,Là c’est trop
,Tu sais c’est pas pour te vexer
,Pour t’le dire j’ai tout essayé
,Tu passes ta vie à me stresser
,Je vais finir par te laisser
,On était bien qu’est-ce qu’on s’aimait
,Mais là le mal est consommé
,Les mots j’peux même plus les trouver
,Dis-moi c’qu’on peut encore sauver
,Pour toi je fais des efforts
,Même tes copines sont d’accord
,Qu’est-ce que tu veux d’moi encore ?
,Là c’est trop (╯°Д°)╯︵ ┻━┻
,On va pas tout gacher,
,Encore se clasher
,Exploser en plein vol et se crasher
,On fait n’importe quoi faut pas s’cacher
,J’ai des choses à te dire quitte à t’facher
,J’ai pas envie de te lacher
,Mais les mots faut pas les macher
,Est-ce qu’un jour enfin tu vas changer?

,
Quand j'ai froid elle se fait lumière
Comme un soleil dans l'existence
Quand j'ai mal elle se fait prière
Elle me dit tout dans un silence
Quand je souffre elle souffre avec moi
Quand je ris, elle rit aux éclats
Mes chansons sont souvent pour elle, elle sera toujours ma merveille
Quand je ne suis pas à la hauteur, elle m'élève plus haut que le ciel
Elle est la splendeur des splendeurs, elle est la sève, elle est le miel
C'est son sang qui coule dans mes veines
Et des souvenirs par centaines
Berçent mon coeur de mille étoiles
Elle est ma quête elle est mon grâal
Oh mon Dieu laissez les moi, les beaux yeux de la mama
Enlevez moi même tout le reste mais pas la douceur de ses gestes
Elle m'a porté avant le monde, elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m'emportera avec elle, je lui serai toujours fidèle
Quand je me blesse elle est douceur, comme une caresse dans l'existence
Quand j'abandonne elle deviens lionne, et me relève avec patience
Quand j'ai la folie des grandeurs, elle me rammène sans me faire mal
Elle est dans ce monde infernal mon étoile parmi les étoiles
Oh mon Dieu laissez les moi, les beaux yeux de la mama
Enlevez moi même tout le reste mais pas la douceur de ses gestes
Elle m'a porté avant le monde, elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m'emporteras avec elle, je lui serai toujours fidèle
Aayyyyyy ayyyy ayyyyy noo me dejes solooo ayyy noooo ayyyyyyyyyyyyy
Oh mon Dieu laissez les moi, les beaux yeux de la mama
Enlevez moi même tout le reste mais pas la douceur de ses gestes
Elle m'a porté avant le monde, elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m'emportera avec elle, je lui serai toujours fidèle
Oh mon Dieu laissez les moi, les beaux yeux de la mama
Enlevez moi même tout le reste mais pas la douceur de ses gestes
Elle m'a porté avant le monde, elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m'emportera avec elle, je lui serai toujours fidèle

,Toujours quelqu'un pour me parler
,Quand j'ai le coeur un peu blessé
,Hey
,Si tu savais comme j'ai pu prier le ciel
,Prier qu'il m'entende

,On dit des mots qu'on ne pense pas
,À trop crier, on reste sans voix
,La vie nous sépare
,Le temps ne répare pas les cœurs en éclats...
,Les cœurs en éclats...
,On se fait du mal parfois sans le vouloir
,On se retrouve seul dans un long couloir
,On prie pour remonter le temps
,Juste une seconde avant de détruire tout espoir
,Ce soir, ma solitude et moi
,On n'parle que de toi
,On attend tous les deux que tu reviennes
,Quand il n'y a que tes yeux qui me retiennent
,Ce soir, ma solitude et moi
,C'est fou comme on a froid
,J'me nourris de silence et tout me pèse
,Je sauve les apparences, mais rien ne m'apaise
,Quand les sanglots ont tué la joie
,Quand on s'est pardonnés trop de fois
,On rêve, on se dessine un présent un peu plus beau qu'avant
,Pour aller vivre où l'amour est roi
,Ce soir, ma solitude et moi
,On n'parle que de toi

,Ce n'est pas ta main dans mes cheveux
,C'est juste le vent capricieux
,Qui souffle sur nos souvenirs
,Et qui me vole à ton sourire
,Ce n'est pas toi derrière la porte
,C'est juste le vent qui t'emporte
,Le silence ne sait pas mentir

,Cachés par les dunes
,Entre terre et mer
,Voler un peu de paix

Je vous parle d'un temps
Que les moins de vingt ans ne peuvent pas connaitre
Montmartre en ce temps-la accrochait ses lilas
Jusque sous nos fenetres et si l'humble garni
Qui nous servait de nid ne payait pas de mine
C'est la qu'on s'est connu
Moi qui criait famine et toi qui posais nue
La boheme, la boheme
Ca voulait dire on est heureux
La boheme, la boheme
Nous ne mangions qu'un jour sur deux
Dans les cafes voisins
Nous etions quelques-uns
Qui attendions la gloire et bien que misereux
Avec le ventre creux
Nous ne cessions d'y croire et quand quelque bistro
Contre un bon repas chaud
Nous prenait une toile, nous recitions des vers
Groupes autour du poele en oubliant l'hiver
La boheme, la boheme.
Ca voulait dire tu es jolie
La boheme, la boheme
Et nous avions tous du genie
Souvent il m'arrivait
Devant mon chevalet
De passer des nuits blanches
Retouchant le dessin
De la ligne d'un sein
Du galbe d'une hanche et ce n'est qu'au matin
Qu'on s'asseyait enfin
Devant un cafe-creme
Epuises mais ravis
Fallait-il que l'on s'aime et qu'on aime la vie
La boheme, la boheme
Ca voulait dire on a vingt ans
La boheme, la boheme
Et nous vivions de l'air du temps
Quand au hasard des jours
Je m'en vais faire un tour
A mon ancienne adresse
Je ne reconnais plus
Ni les murs, ni les rues
Qui ont vu ma jeunesse
En haut d'un escalier
Je cherche l'atelier
Dont plus rien ne subsiste
Dans son nouveau decor
Montmartre semble triste et les lilas sont morts
La boheme, la boheme
On etait jeunes, on etait fous
La boheme, la boheme
Ca ne veut plus rien dire du tout

Quand j'ai froid, elle se fait lumière
Comme un soleil dans l'existence
Quand j'ai mal elle se fait prière
Elle me dit tout dans un silence
Quand je souffre, elle souffre avec moi
Quand je ris, elle rit aux éclats
Mes chansons sont souvent pour elle
Elle se sera toujours ma merveille
Quand je ne suis pas à la hauteur
Elle m'élève plus haut que le ciel
Elle est la splendeurs des splendeurs
Elle est la sève, elle est le miel
C'est son sang qui coule dans mes veines
Et des souvenirs par centaines
Perceur mon cœur de milles étoiles
Elle est ma quête, elle est mon grade
Oh!! mon dieu laissez moi les beaux yeux de la mama
Enlevez moi tout le reste
Mais pas la douceur de ses geste
Elle m'as porté dans le ventre
Elle me porte encore chaque seconde
Elle m'emportera avec elle
Je lui serai toujours fidèle

,Je n'ai qu'une philosophie
,Être accepté comme je suis
,Malgré tout ce qu'on me dit
,Je reste le poing levé
,Pour le meilleur comme le pire
,Je suis gitan mais pas martyre
,J'avance le coeur léger
,Mais toujours le poing levé
,Lever la tête, bomber le torse
,Sans cesse redoubler d'efforts
,La vie ne m'en laisse pas le choix
,Je suis l'as qui bat le roi
,Malgré nos peines, nos différences
,Et toutes ces injures incessantes
,Moi je lèverai le poing
,Encore plus haut, encore plus loin
,Miser la Lune
,Ça me fait pas peur
,Même à l'usure
,J'y crois encore et en coeur
,Des sacrifices
,S'il le faut j'en ferai
,J'en ai déjà fait
,Mais toujours le poing levé
,Moi je n'aime pas toutes ces filles
,Qu'on dévisage, qu'on déshabille
,Moi j'aime les formes et les rondeurs
,Ça sert à réchauffer le coeur
,Fils d'un quartier populaire
,J'y ai appris à être fier
,Bien plus d'amour que de misère
,Bien plus de coeur que de pierre
,Je n'ai qu'une philosophie
,Être accepté comme je suis
,Avec la force et le sourire
,Le poing levé vers l'avenir
,Lever la tête, bomber le torse
,Sans cesse redoubler d'efforts
,La vie ne m'en laisse pas le choix
,Je suis l'as qui bat le roi
,Miser la Lune
,Ça me fait pas peur
,Même à l'usure
,J'y crois encore et en coeur
,Des sacrifices
,S'il le faut j'en ferai
,J'en ai déjà fait

Vous les hommes êtes tous les mêmes
Macho mais cheap, bande de mauviettes infidèles
Si prévisibles, non je ne suis pas certaine
Que tu m'mérites, vous avez d'la chance qu'on vous aime
Dis-moi merci

Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain règlement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous sûrement aux prochaines règles

Cette fois c'était la dernière
Tu peux croire que c'est qu'une crise
Mate une dernière fois mon derrière
Il est à côté de mes valises
Tu diras au revoir à ta mère
Elle qui t'idéalise
Tu n'vois même pas tout c'que tu perds
Avec une autre ce serait pire

Quoi toi aussi tu veux finir maintenant?
C'est l'monde à l'envers
Moi je l'disais pour t'faire réagir, seulement
Toi t'y pensais

Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain règlement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous sûrement aux prochaines règles

Facile à dire je suis gnangnan
Et que j'aime trop les blablablas
Mais non non non c'est important
Ce que t'appelles les ragnagnas
Tu sais la vie c'est des enfants
Mais comme toujours c'est pas l'bon moment
Ah oui pour les faire, là tu es présent
Mais pour les élever y aura des absents

Lorsque je n'serai plus belle
Ou du moins au naturel
Arrête je sais que tu mens
Il n'y a que Kate Moss qui est éternelle

Moche ou belle? C'est jamais bon!
Bête ou belle? C'est jamais bon!
Belle ou moi? C'est jamais bon!
Moi ou elle? C'est jamais bon!

Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous au prochain règlement
Rendez-vous, rendez-vous, rendez-vous sûrement aux prochaines règles

Tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes et y en a marre
Tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes et y en a marre
Tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes et y en a marre
Tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes, tous les mêmes

,Tu me regardes et fais ton entrée
,Premier regard je suis charmé
,Tu es un ange venu me tenter
,Et je pourrais bien succomber
,Entre nous y'a le fuego, l'envie
,Tant de désirs inassouvis
,Si le désir est de la partie
,Me laisse pas solo solo
,J'veux pas m'imposer
,Mais j'tai dans la peau

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
,Somebody that you used to know
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,you didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,somebody I used to know

,Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
,Some nights, I call it a draw
,Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
,Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
,But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
,Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
,What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
,Most nights, I don't know anymore...
,This is it, boys, this is war
,what are we waiting for?
,Why don't we break the rules already?
,I was never one to believe the hype
,save that for the black and white
,Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
,but here they come again to jack my style
,And that's alright
,I found a martyr in my bed tonight
,She stops my bones from wondering
,just who I am, who I am, who I am
,Oh, who am I? Oh, who am I?

,Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
,This one is not for the folks at home
,I'm sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
,Who the f*ck wants to die alone
,all dried up in the desert sun?
,My heart is breaking for my sister
,and the con that she called "love"
,But when I look into my nephew's eyes...
,Man, you wouldn't believe
,the most amazing things that can come from...
,Some terrible nights.
,The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream
,I just had about you and me
,I called you up, but we'd both agree
,It's for the best you didn't listen
,It's for the best we get our distance, oh
,For the best you didn't listen
,It's for the best we get our distance, oh...

,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,I told the World one day I would pay it back
,say it on tape, and lay it, record it
,so that one day I could play it back
,but I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m saying that
,ya’ll starting to creep in, everyday it’s just so grey and black
,hope, I just need a ray of that
,cause no one see’s my vision when I play it for ‘em
,they just say it’s wack
,they don’t know what dope is
,and I don’t know if I was awake or asleep
,when I wrote this,
,all I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
,you picked me up, breeding life in me
,I owe my life to you
,before the life of me, I don’t see why you don’t see like I do
,but it just dawned on me you lost a son
,Demon's fighting you, it’s dark.
,let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
,I don’t think you realize what you mean to me
,not the slightest clue
,cause me and you were like a crew
,I was like your sidekick
,you gone either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
,or you go hug me
,but I’m not an option, there‘s nothing else I can do cause…
,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,It hurts when I see you struggle
,you come to me with ideas
,you say there just pieces so I’m puzzled
,cause the shit I hear is crazy
,but your either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
,seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
,can’t make a decision you keep questioning yourself
,second guessing and it’s almost like your begging for my help
,like I’m your leader
,your supposed to fucking be my mentor
,I can endure no more,
,I demand you remember who you are
,it was YOU, who believed in me
,when everyone was telling you don’t sign me
,everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
,you risked your career for me
,I know it as well as you
,nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy
,Dre, I’m crying in this booth
,you saved my life, now maybe it’s my turn to save yours
,but I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
,but I ain’t giving up faith and you ain’t giving up on me
,get up Dre, I’m dying, I need you, come back for f-ck’s sake
,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor
,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,bring me back to life
,bring me back to life
,(I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life)
,It literally feels like a lifetime ago
,but I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
,you walked in, yellow jump suit
,whole room, cracked jokes
,once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
,went through friends, some of them I put on
,but they just left, they said they was riding to the death
,but where the f-ck are they now
,now that I need them, I don't see none of them
,all I see is Slim
,f-ck all you fair-weather friends
,all I need is him
,fucking backstabbers
,when the chips were down you just laughed at us
,now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
,you go see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f-ck we been?
,you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
,little crack a jack beat making wack math,
,backwards producers, I'm back bastards
,one more CD and then I’m packing up my bags and as I’m leaving
,I’ll guarantee they scream Dre don’t leave us like that man cause…
,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
,I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
,And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
,No post code envy
,But every song's like gold teeth,
,grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
,Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
,We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.
,But everybody's like cristal, maybach,
,diamonds on your time piece.
,Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
,We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
,And we'll never be royals..
,It don't run in our blood,
,that kind of lux just ain't for us.
,We crave a different kind of buzz.
,Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen B
,And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
,Let me live that fantasy.
,My friends and I we've cracked the code.
,We count our dollars on the train to the party.
,And everyone who knows us knows
,that we're fine with this,
,we didn't come from money.
,But every song's like gold teeth,
,grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
,Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,

,We're bigger than we ever dreamed,
,and I'm in love with being queen.
,life is game without a care
,We aren't caught up in your love affair.
,And we'll never be royals,
,it don't run in our blood

,Six feet under screams
,But no one seems to hear a thing
,Do you know that there's still a chance for you
,'Cause there's a spark in you
,You just gotta ignite the light
,And let it shine
,Just own the night
,Like the Fourth of July
,'Cause baby you're a firework
,Come on show 'em what you're worth
,Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh"
,When you shoot across the sky-y-y

,I'll see you in the sunlight
,I'll hear your voice everywhere
,I'll run to tenderly hold you
,But baby you won't be there
,I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
,Knowing the love we'll miss
,So let us make a pledge to meet in September
,And sealed with a kiss
,
,
,
,I'll send you all my dreams everyday in a letter
,Sealed with a kiss
,Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
,But I'll fill the emptiness
,I'll send you all my love everyday in a letter
,Sealed with a kiss
,(Though we gonna say goodbye)
,Sealed with a kiss
,(I don't wanna say goodbye)
,Sealed with a kiss

,Me and my guitar play my way
,It makes them frown
,A little pieces by the high way
,Break me down
,Money's not a hardest stone
,I am only skin and bone now
,Now a little pieces, little pieces of my own
,Why don't you give me some love?
, I've taken a shit load of drugs
,I'm so tired of never fixing the pain
,valium said to me
,I'll take you seriously
,and we'll come back of someone else
,who's better than yourself
,Many faces at the door way
,All hang around
,Watch me fighting in the whole way but
,Made no sounds
,So standing all alone
,And I'm only skin and bone
,So many faces but they all look out for that own.
,Why don't you give me some love?
,I've taken a shit load of drugs

,And let it all out someday
,I know that someday soon we'll all be gone
,So let it all out
,Let it all out
,Today
,And give me some love
,Yeah give me some love
,Come on give me some love

,When sky blue gets dark enough
,To see the colors of the city lights
,A trail of ruby red and diamond white
,Hits her like a sunrise
,She comes and goes and comes and goes
,Like no one can
,Tonight she's out to lose herself
,And find a high on Peachtree Street
,From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
,Heavy into everything
,She comes and goes and comes and goes
,Like no one can
,She comes and goes and no one knows
,She's slipping through my hands
,She's always buzzing just like
,Neon' neon
,Neon' neon
,Who knows how long' how long' how long
,She can go before she burns away
,I can't be her angel now
,You know it's not my place to hold her down
,And it's hard for me to take a stand
,When I would take her anyway I can
,She comes and she goes
,Like no one can
,She comes and she goes

,If you wanna see that Italian tower leaning
,Baby we can leave right now
,If that's too far
,We can jump in the car and take a little trip around town
,They say that California is nice and warm this time of year
,Baby say the word and we'll just disappear
,Cause if you wanna go Baby let's go
,If you wanna rock on ready to roll
,And if you wanna slow down

,And that's not an invitation, that's all I get
,If this is communication I disconnect
,I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect, so I disconnect
,Well this is an invitation, it's not a threat
,If you want communication that's what you get
,I'm talking and talking but I don't know how to connect
,And I hold a record for being patient with your kind of hesitation
,I need you, you want me but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect

,Blowing in the Wind
,Bob Dylan
,How many roads must a man walk down
,
,Before you call him a man?
,
,How many seas must a white dove sail
,
,Before she sleeps in the sand?
,
,How many times must the cannon balls fly
,
,Before they\'re forever banned?
,
,The answer' my friend' is blowin\' in the wind'
,
,The answer is blowin\' in the wind.
,
,How many years can a mountain exist
,
,Before it\'s washed to the sea?
,
,How many years can some people exist
,
,Before they\'re allowed to be free?
,
,And how many times can a man turn his head'
,
,And pretending he just doesn\'t see?
,
,The answer' my friend' is blowin\' in the wind'
,
,The answer is blowin\' in the wind.
,
,How many times must a man look up
,
,Before he can see the sky?
,
,How many ears must one person have
,
,Before he can hear people cry?
,
,And how many deaths will it take till he knows
,
,That too many people have died?
,
,The answer' my friend' is blowin\' in the wind'
,
,The answer is blowin\' in the wind.

,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca

,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet

,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by

Better, oh, baby, give me a sign
(Go wild!)
If you wanna be forever young
(Be young!)
Let me know, not the only one

,
Criticists would write that I wouldn't make it
Now they write about what I make
Acting like the game, I couldn't take it
Now the whole world for the taker
Everyday my birthday
Everyday I get cake, now mommy, lemme see you in yo birthday suit
And lets, lets, lets play

,
It's Chico here, he got it x2
No question, dawg, don't doubt it
Now get loose, get radical
Dope with them loose, don't see 'em
Your playas meet? I don't cheat 'em
Well, I'm taking ova these companies,
I got steel bands and twelve dealers

,
My music is hot, defending the block
Put the hand on the court, defend the ,
Then play with the pot, handle the rum
Bag them up, then hit it with mine
Also, I'm drillin' it, overseas, I'm killin' it
I jsut came to have some fun, so see you, Lo
Keep singin' it!

Lets get trippin' at the private party
Black girl twerk like Miley Cyrus
Lets see how many model chicks
Can fit inside my Ferrari
You a bad girl? Trim it how you knot
The kill don't hurt nobody
I'm rollin' up that loud pack
My groove fatter than a hot tomalle
We sippin' lean, poppin' bottles
I take more shots than the paparazzi
These gaters don't need no problems
I got more goons than John Gotti
Maybe, lately, it's going down like greatly
Stick yo good to my whole team,
Then leave it up like mayweather
In the V. I. P., I pop 100D
That's Juicy J and this pappy
You might have to go and find a party
We owning all of these parties
Like a ,
Get more blink than a gold chain
These college girls got no shame
Party hard all cold night

,Les Vacances Au Bord De La Mer

,
,On allait au bord de la mer
,Avec mon père, ma soeur, ma mère
,On regardait les autres gens
,Comme ils dépensaient leur argent
,
,Nous
,Il fallait faire attention
,Quand on avait payé le prix d'une location
,Il ne nous restait pas grand chose
,
,Alors on regardait les bateaux
,On suçait des glaces à l'eau
,Les palaces, les restaurants
,On n'faisait que passer d'vant
,Et on regardait les bateaux
,Le matin, on s'réveillait tôt
,Sur la plage, pendant des heures
,On prenait de belles couleurs
,
,On allait au bord de la mer
,Avec mon père, ma soeur, ma mère
,Et quand les vagues étaient tranquilles
,On passait la journée aux îles
,Sauf quand on pouvait déjà plus
,
,Alors on regardait les bateaux
,On suçait des glaces à l'eau
,On avait l'coeur un peu gros
,Mais c'était quand même beau

,Des yeux qui font baiser les miens

,De l'homme auquel j'appartiens
,Quand il me prend dans ses bras
,Il me parle tout bas
,Je vois la vie en rose
,Il me dit des mots d'amour
,Des mots de tous les jours
,Et ca me fait quelque chose
,Il est entre dans mon coeur
,Une part de bonheur
,Dont je connais la cause
,C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui
,Dans la vie
,Il me l'a dit, l'a jure pour la vie
,Et des que je l'apercois
,Alors je sens en moi
,Mon coeur qui bat
,Des nuits d'amour a ne plus en finir
,Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place
,Des enuis des chagrins, des phases
,Heureux, heureux a en mourir

,Le bal allait bientōt se terminer
,Devais-je m'en aller ou bien rester
,L'orchestre allait jouer le tout dernier morceau
,Quand je t'ai vu passer près de moi
,C'était la dernière valse
,Mon coeur n' était plus sans amour
,Ensemble cette valse
,Nous l'avons dansée pour toujours
,On s'est aimé longtemps toujours plus fort
,Nos joies, nos peines avaient le même accord
,Et puis un jour j'ai vu changer tes yeux
,Tu as brisé mon coeur en disant adieu
,C'était la dernière valse
,Mon coeur restait seul sans amour
,Et pourtant cette valse aurait pu durer toujours
,Ainsi va la vie, tout est bien fini
,Il me reste une valse et mes larmes
,La La La...
,C'était la dernière valse
,Mon coeur restait seul sans amour
,Et pourtant cette valse aurait pu durer toujours
,Toujours...
,Toujours...

早晨
仍是昨夜的清风 渗于四周
仍是这样轻的手 贴于我手
在那窗纱尽头 随着软风晨光透
燃亮着在桌上 没喝完的酒
梦也片刻逗留 才幻化痴情一缕
到此方知酒醒 而热爱仍旧
仍是昨夜的温馨 彷佛永久
仍是灼热的相拥 谁理时候
在这小小地球 缘份到底难猜透
原来但愿你能 伴我便足够
共你这么自由 甜蜜笑声常拥有
那管天光天黑 仍紧握你手

,The look of love
,Is in your eyes
,The look your smile can't disguise
,The look of love
,Is saying so much more
,Than just words could ever say
,And what my heart has heard
,Well it takes my breath away
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,You've got the look of love
,It's on your face
,A look that time can't erase
,Be mine tonight
,Let this be just the start
,Of so many nights like this
,Let's take a lover's vow
,And then seal it with a kiss
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,Don't ever go
,Don't ever go
,I love you so
,I can hardly wait to hold you

,De partir n'importe ou,
,Bras dessus, bras dessous,
,En chantant des chansons.
,C'est si bon
,De se dir' des mots doux,
,Des petits rien du tout
,Mais qui en disent long.
,En voyant notre mine ravie
,Les passants, dans la rue, nous envient.
,C'est si bon
,De guetter dans ses yeux
,Un espoir merveilleux
,Qui donne le frisson.
,C'est si bon,
,Ces petit's sensations.

,Tout le long de son dos
,Tandis que nous dansons.
,C'est inou? ce qu'elle a pour séduire,
,Sans parler de c'que je n'peux pas dire.
,C'est si bon,
,Quand j'la tiens dans mes bras,
,De me dir'que tout ?a
,C'est à moi pour de bon.
,C'est si bon,
,Et si nous nous aimons,
,Cherchez pas la raison :
,C'est parc'que c'est si bon,
,C'est parce que c'est si bon,
,C'est parce que c'est trop bon.

Sean, what can I say?
When you think you've had enough
And there's no more games to play
If you're feeling life has just passed you by
And the stories all end the, the same
If the little lies that you tell each night
Don't impress, then you need to change
Well, it's all right here in the game
Can you see yourself fall in or out of love
It's always the same
Can you be yourself and give enough for us?
Well, no one can play
If you're feeling out of touch
While your dreams all slip away
If you're feeling tired of the bumpy ride
And the roads all lead you away
From the city life and the phony smiles
Don't forget, your home's where you stay
But it's all just part of the game
Where you see yourself go in or out of love
You're always the same
Can you free yourself and live enough for us?
Ah, la da, da da
Well, it's all right here in the game
Can you see yourself fall in or out of love
It's always the same
Can you be yourself and give enough for
All just part of the game
Where you see yourself go in or out of love
You're always the same
Can you free yourself and live enough for us?
There's a soul in you and I
Only it can make you cry
Don't let it pass you by
If you feel that it's passed you by
And if you're feeling tired
Living the city life
There's a soul living in you and I
Only it can make you cry
Don't let it pass you by
If you feel that it's passed you by
And if you're feeling tired
Living the city life
But don't let it pass you by, no, no

,We're bound to get in tune again
,Before too long
,There'll be no desafinado

,
,I can hear the earth in orbit
,
,In the night air
,In The night air
,
,in The night air
,

,
,And each thought like a thief is driven

Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
I can only love you
It feels like poison
If not for you
No love in front of me
Nobody told you
It's not how it's supposed to be
Make a wish and blow it out
Love will begin again
I don't want to be a clown
The whole town is laughing
Behind my back, you're supposed to be a friend
If not for you
No love in front of me
Nobody told you
It's not how it's supposed to be
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
It’s not how it’s supposed to be
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison

,I'll be dreaming of good times
,Oh, I'm sure it'll stop the cryin'
,If only you'd come back to me
,Baby maybe then
,I can stop this lyin'
,To myself
,Oh...
,All these sounds
,Sometimes silence can be so damn loud
,Baby girl if
,I could have my choice
,I'd only hear your voice
,Feel you breathe and feel the earth move when you're touchin' me
,So many things that
,I wish that I can do with you
,So maybe if
,I close my eyes maybe then
,I can see you smiling

,Couldn't capture what you mean to me, girl
,If a picture's worth a thousand words
,No million pictures could speak for her
,La la la la la la la la la la la...

,The Shadow of Your Smile
,- John Gary
,
,The shadow of your smile
,when you are gone
,Will color all  my dreams
,and light the dawn
,Look into my eyes
,my love ,and see
,All the lovly things
,you are to me
,
,Our wistful little star
,was far too high
,A teardrop kissed your lips
,and so did I
,Now when I remember spring
,All the joy that love can bring
,I will be remembering
,The shadow of your smile
,
,Look into my eyes
,my love ,and see
,All the lovely things

,and so did I
,Now when I remember spring

,I will be remembering
,The shadow of your smile
,The shadow of your smile
,
,
,So I hopped on a train
,Three in the afternoon
,I don't know when I'm coming back
,But I hope that it's soon
,See I never thought, never thought, that I'd have to leave your side, your side
,It's only physically
,But know that you will be on my mind
,Twenty four hours at a time24
,'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine
,No matter where you go
,I won't be very far
,'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
,'Cause love has no distance baby
,Love has no distance baby
,No, not when it comes to you and me
,See she wrote me a letter
,Said the weather wasn't better
,But she said that she was doing fine
,I wanna see you face to face
,That's what she wrote to me that day
,And I knew that it was all a sign
,So I wrote back with this song
,Promise it won't be too long
,Wanna make up for all our lost time
,'Cause in my eyes you were mine, you were mine
,No matter where you go
,I won't be very far
,'Cause in my head I'll be right there where you are
,'Cause love has no distance baby
,Love has no distance baby
,No, not when it comes to you and me
,So I'm going through these boxes
,My life's gone off track
,'Cause it's been three years
,She hasn't written back
,But in my eyes
,She's still mine
,And I know it sounds so stupid
,To be waiting this long
,But I'm still in love and I know I'm not wrong
,'Cause in my eyes
,She was mine
,No matter where you go
,I won't be very far

Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them goodness knows
My honeysuckle rose

Fly was dropping side when you're passing by
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's so sweet when you stir it up

On the avenue people look at you
And I know just why they do
You're much sweeter goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Ela é meu treino de futebol
Ela é meu domingão de sol
Ela é meu esquema
Ela é meu concerto de rock'roll
Nação, minha torcida gritando gol
Minha Ipanema
Ela é meu curso de anatomia
Ela é meu retiro espiritual
Ela é minha história
Ela é meu desfile internacional
Ela é meu bloco de carnaval
Minha evolução...
Galega
Tento descrever o que é estar com você
Princesa
Todos vão saber que eu estou muito bem com você
Ela é minha ilha da Fantasia
A mais avançada das terapias
Meu Playcenter
Ela é minha pista alucinada
A mais concorrida das baladas
Meu inferninho
Ela é meu esporte radical
Poderosa, viciante, mas não faz mal
Meu docinho
Ela é o que meu médico receitou

Minha chapação...

Nem dá pra dizer o que é estar com você

Mon dieu que c'est lache

Quelle tragedie,quel tracas
Mon dieu que c'est vache
Mon amoureux est reparti la-bas
Mon dieu que c'est triste
Il m'aimait si peu
Moi je l'aimais tant je crois
Mon dieu tu t'en fiches
Toi tu n'as d'yeux
Que pour une autre que moi
Meme si le temps passe
Je n'oublie pas
La samba
La samba des jours avec toi

La samba de mon coeur qui bat

C'est ennuyeux
Tu t'es joue de moi
Mon dieu que c'est cloche
De se dire adieu
Et Paris est si froid
Mon dieu si tu existes meme un peu
Ramene-moi
Mon aquarelliste
Si vaniteux
Qui ne peignait que moi
Meme si le temps passe
Je n'oublie pas
If blood will flow when fresh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
On and on the rain will fall
On and on the rain will fall
Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are
On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star
On and on the rain will see how fragile we are
If blood will flow when fresh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star
On and on the rain will see how fragile we are
how fragile we are, how fragile we are
How fragile we are, how fragile we are

, Of the stranger she meets in her dreams
, He'll come alone to her from out of the shadows
, And brighten up the stars always so dim
, He’ll lead her to a dance in the moonlight
, Then she’ll kiss him like she never did
,
, And the music will go on
, And she won't be alone
,
, She leaves her nightly dreams with abandon
, She likes to feel the rain on her skin
, She doesn't know his name, never asked him (had to)

,
, They’ll be walking on the streets of a new world
, There'll be no familiar places, no one they know
, Only they will fill up all of the spaces with emotion
, It's her dream, and she knows he'll be gone soon
, Soon, soon, soon
, So soon...

, The lover of her life
, When she opens up her eyes
, He’ll be there right by her side

I don't know what's playing
Deep in my emotions
I live so close to the river
My dreams sing in slow motion
I wait by the waterfront
That's where 
I'll be holding
These goddamn feelings, 
I'm feeling
I shall be folding
I step on slippery sidewalks
I'm slowly moving along
Through somber paths in the alley
My weakness gets strong
Bajo a tomar un café, tropiezo casi caigo y siento que,por un momento pierdo la fé.
Me consuelo pensando que ya no muerdo el anzuelo,levanto el alma del suelo, prendo un pucho, y salgo de este sucucho.
Llevo en la mano el cigarro y pienso "otro crack con pies de barro".
Mejor jugar de callado y nunca treparse al carro,ando emperrado en encontrar el tiempo perdido, en lamentos apretados,en penales casi siempre mal pateados.
Laburo por chirolas, no quiero seguir y decido salir de la cola.
Y aunque el lobo no puede, y aunque las gambas casi no quieren,doy una vuelta a ver si todavía llueve.
Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción
El vidrio que me mira, la gente que dobla la esquina, la bocanada casi me tiray la rambla, que sigue vacía.
Suelo mojado, el tránsito encajonadocomo un perro que ladra encerrado en una trampa desconocida
La lluvia que salpica la memoria enrojecida por la nostalgia,como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas
Tiempo mejor, cielo de miel, ahora que sale el sol...y empieza a calentar la piel.
Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción
Bronco tosarrón de tanto fumar, ganas de empezar a caminary dejar de pensar en flores que se queman de frío, en un sucio jarrón vacío en un 
Río de Plata marrón que ahora miro sin apuro.
Chiflo bajo, me pateo el hormigón mientras pienso, calentón, que me rajo del laburo y que me rajó con razón.
Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción
Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción
Ya no duele el corazón
Ya no duele el corazón
Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción
Leyó otra vez,casi sin verenvuelto en una densa nube de emociónperdió su olor… y aquél saborde las mañanas, de una vida que venció…hoy, hoy, hoy
Leyó otra vez, y caminobajo esa puta lluvia que no deja de golpeary la sintió… que va a sentirmientras las lagrimas brotaban a granelleyó otra vez, se sorprendióbuscando auxilio un remedio compasióny en un café se refugioy afuera el mundo continuaba sin razón
Hoy no supo y no es grupo esta roto por adentrofue tan bruta la sentenciaesa clínica evidencia
Ella ahora esta ahí… y ahí palmoen esa zona a donde arruga hasta el dolory es que además… no puede verporque el futuro hoy se le desmoronoy el vidrio intenta desempañarcomo si así fuera a borrar su maldición
Leyó otra vez, se dijo adiósen adelante solo habría despedidas

Avanzo y escribo
Decido un camino
Las ganas que quedan se marchan con vos
Se apaga el deseo
Ya no me entre veo
Y hablar es lo que se me va mejor
Con los ojos no te veo
Se que se me viene el mareo
Y es entonces cuando quiero salir a caminar
Con los ojos no te veo
Se que se me viene el mareo
Y es entonces cuando quiero salir a caminar
El aire me siega, hay vidrio en la arena
Ya no me da pena, dejarte un adios
Asi son las cosas, amargas borrosas
Son fotos veladas de un tiempo mejor
Con los ojos no te veo
Se que se me viene el mareo
Y es entonces cuando quiero salir a caminar
Con los ojos no te veo
Se que se me viene el mareo
Y es entonces cuando quiero salir a caminar

Porque no voy a luchar por tu amor 
si no tengo na' que perder 
si no me lo das tu 
otro lo hará 
y volveré como siempre 
a sentirme bien 
porque sin amor yo no vivo 
soy como el nido...

los asesinatos sin testigos 
no mendigo, solo pido 
porque tengo mucho que ofrece 
ahí esta el placer de sabe 
ese ruido 
aunque me equivoque todo vale 
mi mente en vida 
desde el principio con la verdad a cuestas 
me acuesto con los mismiticos que me levanté 
soy lo mismo que ayer... 
soy lo que me enseñaron 
los viejos y viejas que escuché 
dejamelo hacer 
yo creo que esta bien 
nunca es tarde pa rectificar 
tu y yo lo podemo hace 

CORO: 
Pierdo esta puerta 
pero estoy en el andén 
de aquí no me muevo 
no pienso perder el tren 
tengo las palabras mágica 
papi escuchame. X2 

deja de pensar 
que deja de pensar 
bueno... 
raíz cuadra' de la mitad 
eleva' y dividia' 
por la razón de los cosenos 
mi materia gris frente a ti 
se convierte en un potente veneno 
checha lo profundo 
derrite el sola' 
dame una señal y ahi pon freno 
a todas las injusticias 
en el mundo de Alicia 
por no tener claro porque vamos 
en este carro sin frenos 
mi viejo sueño 
ya llevamos un buen trago (yo) 
no me lavo las manos como un matasano 
esos se va a caer tarde o temprano 
la mala muerde la manzana...

Look into the others eyes, many frustrations
Read between the lines, no words just vibrations,
Don't ignore hidden desires
Pay attention, you're playing with fire
Silence must be heard, noise should be observed
The time has come to learn, that silence...
SILENCE MUST BE HEARD
Or diamonds will burn, friendly cards will turn
'Cause silence has the right to be heard
People talk too much for what they have to say
Words without a meaning, they are fading away
Silence must be heard, noise should be observed
The time has come to learn, that silence...
SILENCE MUST BE HEARD
Or diamonds will burn, friendly cards will turn
'Cause silence has the right to be heard

I come very briefly to this place.

I watch it shake. 
Kumowaku yamano. 
Watashino sakebi.

Ushano kokoku. 
Watashiwa sokoni.

Mountain with clouds. 
A cry. My voice. 
Home of the brave. 
I'm here now. 
And lost. 
They say the dead will rise again. 
And here they come now. 
Strange animals out of the 
Ice Age. And they stare at you. 
Dumbfounded. 
Like big mistakes. 
And we say: 
Keep cool. 
Maybe if we pretend this never happened, they'll all just go away.

Closed. Birds are there. 
Hearing something. 
Shouting.

Birds are there. 
Hearing something. 
A shout. They say the world is smaller n ow. 
Small world. 
They say that man is taller now. 
Tall man. 
They say the stars are closer now. 
Thank you, lucky stars. 
You come very briefly to this place. 
Jikanwa tomaru. 
Ushano kokoku. 
Time is stopped. 
Home of the brave. 
And on a very distant star, slimy creatures scan the skies. 
They've got plates for hands. 
And telescopes for eyes. 
And they say: 
Look! Down 
They say: 
Watch it move. 
Watch it shake. 
Watch it turn. 
And shake.

My eyes are shut. 
Shut. And we say: 
Watch us move. 
Watch us shake. 
We're so pretty. 
We're so pretty. 
We say: Watch us move now. 
Watch us shake. 
We're so pretty. 
Shake our hands. 
Shake our heads. 
We shake our feet. 
We're so fine. 
The way we move. 
The way we shake. 
We're so nice.
She’s wearing a tuxedo
Her hands are painted black
She walks like a superhero
With the grace of a cat
She sets her eyes on you
Catches you with a lasso
You don’t know what you’ll go through
It’s too late to
She moves she moves around
you as the beat gets to you
It makes you sing sing sing with the song
You turn around she’s already gone
And then she spins she spins around you
See her face beside you
Like a young girl to you
She only needs one shot
She directs her carci nova
Bright lights under a spot
And just what you can do
Move as fast as you can
The best thing she can do
She moves she moves around
you as the beat gets to you
It makes you sing sing sing with the song
You turn around she’s already gone
And then she spins she spins around you
She is s tretching her back next to you
See her face beside you
Like a young girl you

Estamos salvos e estamos vivos
Agora não temos mais nada a perder
Nós nos tornamos imortais
Nós temos o alimento dos deuses
O alto das montanhas não tem mais segredo para a gente
Descalços caminhamos sobre o fogo
Podem até rir na nossa cara
Nós temos o alimento dos deuses

,墙壁上面挖一个壁炉 大得很欧洲
,眯着眼睛 喝一杯酒 笑得很懒惰
,你说要 找个画家画一个我 挂在壁炉上面
,我要画不传音符的 我要画不传音符的
,我的生活要重新开始 还是结束了
,我是站在热带雨林里 还是在沙漠
,你的微笑和我的回忆在恋歌房里
,抢麦克风 快捂耳朵
,角落里有一个人 一个似曾相识的人
,居然听得动了感情 动了感情 动了真感情

,哪怕只是昙花
,也会一夜长大　小想法终究会发芽
,出发吧不要怕
,候鸟到达前没有家　逆风中也优雅
,这一刹那看着同一片的晚霞
,你也像我吗　怀疑过吗
,理想的存在吗　天使从不说话
,纸屑被吹起又落下
,因为你　我找到第二个家
,我是我是你也可以是他
,我把我的执着都放下
,心在哪天堂就在哪
,因为你　我找到第二个家
,我是我是你也可以是他
,我把我的盔甲都卸下
,然後更潇洒
,时间会被风化
,为何还放不下　浪花也曾经是海沙
,混乱中有规划
,有白鸽也会有乌鸦　有期待有惊讶
,这一刹那看着同一片的晚霞
,你也像我　吗否定过吗
,美好的存在吗天　使从不回答
,有人说梦话在沙发
,因为你　我找到第二个家
,我是我是你也可以是他
,我把我的执着都放下
,我在哪不太重要吧
,因为你　我找到第二个家

,It came up sudden，walking normal
,While we tried to conversate
,It stopped me from falling, it help me follow through
,And she never ask me why, the story goes
,We played our rules, we're dancing quiet
,While the storm is raging round
,The candy store, the magic of silence
,And another chance at love
,The made up rules, the man made options
,And a way that we should talk
,We never bothered, we never cared to see
,And we made a life we need
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.
,I want you to stay, around and be with me.
,I want you to stay~
,The story started, a made up calling
,With an awkward rendezvous
,We start off slowly, we stopped off one coffee
,With another long goodbye
,We started talking, we started listening
,And we understood ourselves
,I started to see, that i was not all alone
,And maybe you were here
,Don't understand, the way you carried me.

Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice
Someone to understand
Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand
And be a team with me
So nice, life would be so nice
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me
Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me
Some little samba song
Someone to take my heart
And give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to
Give love a start with me
Oh yeah, that would be so nice
I could see you and me, that would be nice
Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right

O pato vinha cantando alegremente, quém, quém
Quando um marreco sorridente pediu
Pra entrar também no samba, no samba, no samba
O ganso gostou da dupla e fez também quém, quém
Olhou pro cisne e disse assim \"vem, vem\"
Que o quarteto ficará bem, muito bom, muito bem
Na beira da lagoa foram ensaiar
Para começar o tico-tico no fubá
A voz do pato era mesmo um desacato
Jogo de cena com o ganso era mato
Mas eu gostei do final quando caíram n'água
E ensaiando o vocal
Quém, quém, quém, quém
Quém, quém, quém, quém

,Oh tell me if that fear will one day disappear
,I think that I’ve tasted a part of the answer
,And all that I know doesn’t make me a knower
,How can I see things with the eyes of unconcern?
,I don’t know, no I don’t know
,Will I find innocence without being burnt?
,I do not dare to ask you for a solution,
,Because I need to draw myself a conclusion.
,If I keep faltering, I’ll surrender
,Then I must master my dark side

,My own everlasting child
,That he comes back as a glorious saviour

 Kill me
 This Friday night
 What have you found
 More clocks, more walls
 Please, don't play with me
 Don't play with me
 
 When in times I grow
 I need more time
 I was young and old
 I had dreams
 And wrecks all over bring out
 An engineer to clear this path
 Mothers and fathers tell me
 Did I do good
 Were you pleased with me
 
 When in times I grow
 I need more time
 I was young and old
 I had thoughts
 So many thoughts
 
 When in times I grow
 I need more time
 I was young and old
 I had dreams
 Oh, dreams

Se você disser que eu desafino amor
Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor
Só privilegiados têm ouvido igual ao seu
Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu
Se você insiste em classificar
Meu comportamento de anti-musical
Eu mesmo mentindo devo argumentar
Que isto é bossa-nova, isto é muito natural
O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente
É que os desafinados também têm um coração
Fotografei você na minha Roleiflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão
Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor(assim do meu amor)
Que é o maior que você pode encontrar
Você com sua música esqueceu o principal
Que no peito dos desafinados

Nação, minha torcida gritando gol
Minha Ipanema

Ela é minha história
Ela é meu desfile internacional
Ela é meu bloco de carnaval
Minha evolução...

Tento descrever o que é estar com você
Princesa
Todos vão saber que eu estou muito bem com você
Ela é minha ilha da Fantasia
A mais avançada das terapias
Meu Playcenter
Ela é minha pista alucinada
A mais concorrida das baladas
Meu inferninho
Ela é meu esporte radical
Poderosa, viciante, mas não faz mal
Meu docinho
Ela é o que meu médico receitou

Minha chapação...

Nem dá pra dizer o que é estar com você

É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É um caco de vidro
É a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte
É um laço, é o anzol...
É peroba do campo
O nó da madeira
Caingá, Candeia
É o matita-pereira...
É madeira de vento
Tombo da ribanceira
É um mistério profundo
É o queira ou não queira...
É o vento ventando
É o fim da ladeira
É a viga, é o vão
Festa da Cumieira...
É a chuva chovendo
É conversa ribeira
Das águas de março
É o fim da canseira...
É o pé é o chão
É a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão
Pedra de atiradeira...
Uma ave no céu
Uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte
É um pedaço de pão...
É o fundo do poço
É o fim do caminho
No rosto o desgosto
É um pouco sozinho...
É um estrepe, é um prego
É uma ponta, é um ponto
É um pingo pingando
É uma conta, é um conto...
É um peixe, é um gesto
É uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manhã
É o tijolo chegando...
É a lenha, é o dia
É o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana
Estilhaço na estrada...
É o projeto da casa
É o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado
É a lama, é a lama...
É um passo é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato
Na luz da manhã...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É uma cobra, é um pau
É João, é José
É um espinho na mão
É um corte no pé...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É um passo, é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte
É uma febre terçã...
São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração...
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho...
É pau, é pedra

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh
(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile - but she doesn't see (doesn't see)
(She just doesn't see, she never sees me, )

Um cantinho, um viol?o

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor, que lindo

Se que voc eu desafino disertaciÃ³n amor
Saiba isso que em mim provocaciÃ³n imensa dor
S privilegiados tm ouvido ao seu Igual
Eu possuo apenas o que deus me deu
Se insiste em voc classificar
Meu comportamento de anti-musical
Eu mesmo mentindo devo argumentar
Que isto bossa nova, isto muito natural
O que voc no pressente nem sequer sabe
Que os desafinados tambm tm um corao
Na minha fotografei voc roleiflex
Revelou-se una sua enorme ingratido
S assim ningÃºn poder falar do meu amor
Este o maior que voc pode encontrar
Com sua voc msica esqueceu o principales
Que no peito dos desafinados
No fundo hacer peito bate calado
Que no peito dos desafinados
Tambm corao um bate

Ela é carioca
Ela é carioca
Basta o jeitinho dela andar
Nem ninguém tem carinho assim para dar
Eu vejo na cor dos seus olhos
As noites do Rio ao luar
Vejo a mesma luz
Vejo o mesmo céu
Vejo o mesmo mar
Ela é meu amor, só me vê a mim
A mim que vivi para encontrar
Na luz do seu olhar
A paz que sonhei
Só sei que sou louco por ela
E pra mim ela é linda demais
E além do mais
Ela é carioca
Ela é carioca
Só sei que sou louco por ela
E pra mim ela é linda demais
E além do mais
Ela é carioca
Ela é carioca

 Pega esse aviÖo
 VocÉ tem razÖo
 De correr assim desse frio
 Mas veja o meu Rio de Janeiro
 Antes que o aventureiro lance mÖo
 
 Pede perdÖo
 Pela duraÃÖo dessa temporada
 Mas nÖo diga nada
 Que me viu chorando
 E pros da pesada, diz que eu vou levando
 
 VÉ como È que anda
 Aquela vida Þ toa
 E se puder, me manda
 Uma notÌcia boa

,Embarrassed by the crowd.
,I felt he read my letters
,And he just read them out loud.
,I prayed that he would finish.

,Singing my life with his words,

,Some say love,
,it is a river
,that drowns the tender reed.
,Some say love,
,it is a razor
,that leaves your soul to bleed.
,Some say love,
,it is a hunger,
,an endless aching need.
,I say love,
,it is a flower,
,and you it's only seed.
,It's the heart,
,afraid of breaking,
,that never learns to dance.
,It's the dream,
,afraid of waking,
,that never takes a chance.
,It's the one
,who won't be taken,
,who cannot seem to give.
,And the soul,
,afraid of dyin',
,that never learns to live.
,
,When the night has been too lonely,
,and the road has been too long,
,And you think that love is only
,for the lucky and the strong,
,Just remember
,in the winter
,far beneath the bitter snows,
,Lies the seed,
,that with the sun's love,
,in the spring becomes the rose

,You ask me if I love you
,And I choke on my reply
,I'd rather hurt you honestly
,Than mislead you with a lie
,For who am I to judge you
,In what you say or do
,I'm only just beginning
,To see the real you
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,Romance's an honest strategy
,Leaves me battling with my pride
,But through the insecurity
,Some tenderness survives
,I'm just another writer
,Still trapped within my truth
,A hesitant prize-fighter
,Still trapped within my youth
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,At times I'd like to break you
,And drive you to your knees
,At times I'd like to break through
,And hold you endlessly
,At times I understand you
,And I know how hard you try
,I've watched while love commands you
,And I've watched love pass you by
,At times I think we're drifters
,Still searching for a friend
,A brother or a sister
,But then the passion flares again....
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,Fly me to the moon
,And let me play among the stars
,Let me see what spring is like
,On Jupiter and Mars
,In other words,
,Hold my hand
,In other words,

,有时候也宁可当作你在为我加油
,
,不知道在妄想什么 只告诉自己 I Believe
,你总会看到我 在某个时候
,
,想让你陪伴的是我
,
,I Believe 没有回应的时候
,
,只不过 正好你在电话中
,
,I Believe 语音信箱的沉默
,

,就算牵的不是我的手
,我真的不难过
,
,不知道在高兴什么 你的笑容
,有时候也宁可当作你在为我加油
,
,不知道在妄想什么 只告诉自己I Believe
,你总会看到我　在一切之后
,留在你身边的是我
,那延续太久的一时冲动
,
,在你身后的独角戏　聚光灯没亮过
,怀疑　是自己编造的内容
,
,你从不真的认得我
,不知道在高兴什么　你的笑容
,有时候也宁可当作你在为我加油
,
,不知道在妄想什么　只告诉自己I Believe
,一定会有结果
,
,在很久以后　留在你身边的是我

,别让悔熏乌了从前
,也许碎片才能让回忆展颜
,何妨瓷花拼凑明天

,却自己谜中困锁
,谁为我留下缱绻的天涯
,信物是抹晚霞

,若是真爱配尝几分苦甜
,意念婆娑时间里推磨

,誓言斑驳情雾只是经过
,风雨中且让

,Wanderlove - Rita Calypso
,Come my love and we shall wander
,all of life to see and know
,when the seasons lost her trembling
,all things come and all things go
,We'll climb up the snowy mountain,
,sail across the rolling seas.
,We shall live for one another,
,I for you, and you for me.
,We'll go down to green grass meadows,
,where the cold winds never blow.
,If we taste the wine of loving,
,only you and I shall know.
,Come now my love
,and we shall wander
,just to see what we can find.
,If we only find each other,
,still the journey's worth the time
,still the journey's worth the time.

,sunsets to be ridden into
,Not a lot I can do but give in to the drifter

,Kiss you my love
,Kiss you and never miss you my love
,If I could only be like the stars
,Hold you my love
,Spend the tender nights

,Календарь - таблицы из ненужных чисел.
,Вариантов нет, одному никак.
,Я найду твой след, навстречу сделай шаг.
,Этот мир для тебя ввесь,
,Раздели его со мной. Останься здесь.
,Это я, - и я твой ввесь!
,Любовь к тебе от земли до небес.
,Губы словно мёд! Глазками зовет.
,Одна на миллион! Я в тебя влюблен.
,Губы словно мёд. Её губы меня манят.
,Глазками зовет, они взглядом меня ранят.
,Одна на миллион, ты одна и нету слаще.
,Я в тебя влюблен и не знаю, как жить дальше.
,Я тону в твоих глазах,
,И теперь мне неведом страх.
,Утопаю целиком, без остатка.
,Затянул азарт, ты моя загадка.
,Меня от себя не гони.
,Я ключи подберу и открою.
,В своё сердце меня ты впусти,
,И собою тебя я укрою.
,От тебя мне не нужно слов.
,Может станет другой твоим мужем.
,Ведь все равно любить я готов,
,Даже если тебе я не нужен.
,Губы словно мёд! Глазками зовет.
,Одна на миллион! Я в тебя влюблен.

 When she told me that she loved me . . .

, I'm a fight until free
, find our freedom from defeat
, I wanna honor who you are, not try'na play on
, See the other guys you relied on
, They broke your heart but it grew strong
, We can be the perfect love song
, and watch the skies fall
, Wake up in the morning from the nights calm
, And see the sunrise while we stay tall
, Perfect intuition, you're my angel one I visioned
, that I always could envision
, To be wifey for my children cuz together we can fly
, Forever you and I on this mission

, I never told you how I love you
, kept my heart on the other side
, Looking for a safer ride, easier to say goodbye
, So bad when I want it but front when I lose it
, So I turn to the music
, And you turn to your phone
, and you wish what we had
, will remain in our home
, from the names we were call
, Never was a gentleman
, making scenes at the mall
, Yea just for the little things
, always was so ignorant
, Never thought the love
, that you bring was the best for me
, And you the smarter me
, I'm the loser in this tragedy
, In the ugly side, gently blinded me
, No romeo inside of me, to begin with be proud
, In my head would be time patient through the fights
, On this stage we call life, we can glide you and I
, Complicated from the start, so we aiming for the stars
, Start with the sentiment, I'm a gentleman
, I'll be the one to catch you
, when you're falling from the sky
, I'll be the one to hold you baby
, together we can fly

,it's time to feel my broken heart
,betray my mind crawling in my soul and body
,it's time to light the night
,so let me get mine standing in the fire
,burn me maybe
,white snow
,all around me
,幽灵般的嘲笑我的恐惧
,black smoke
,all around me
,监视一举一动感觉快要窒息
,red skin all around me
,没收我们一切本就应该有的武器
,blue sea
,all around me
,一次又一次的突破风浪包围后我才知道
,生命是多么渺小
,他们都喜欢站在高处
,批判中总是带着多少不屑
,风在吼马在叫
,为何自视甚高却不敢画上句号
,自己的剧本自己写自己的问题还是自己解
,别人的烦恼千丝万缕也是自己剪
,这世上根本没有所谓纯粹濒临灭绝
,究竟什么样的交易才能安心一些，把双手交叉
,放在谁的胸口 到底又扼杀了多少理想的凶手
,十字路口看你笑话的人
,没太在意不苟言笑叫骂了神
,层叠阴霾逼近
,往往心怀敌意
,属于我的奇迹
,打破你的鄙弃
,it's time to feel my broken heart
,betray my mind crawling in my soul and body

,关于这首歌的画面
,不是白色但也不是黑色
,just like rainbow
,转眼间不知不觉
,已经过了三年
,四分之一个解释是我的对手
,但花开终究面临花落
,对将要逝去的好奇
,迫使我勇敢的接受
,不断的欺骗自己
,伪装成你想看到的样子
,才能掩饰我的开口
,给我退 直线加速的坠
,快接近地心表面
,冲动燃烧成了灰
,ain't nobody give a fuck about mercy
,复制故事粘贴无知
,这够不够赦免我的罪
,我从始至终根本不想理会那些勾心斗角
,听一些不痛不痒的建议根本不奏效
,等待迁徙的候鸟偏离轨道畏手畏脚
,像讨厌整个冬天一样真的没完没了
,太多的包袱变成了倒数
,停不下的放肆着欲望张牙舞爪
,堆积如山bull shit的生活
,需要重新new check
,拜托的照顾见证了套路
,一次又一次的尝试着自我封闭
,不顾一切的声嘶力竭有谁能够听见
,太阳像往常一样升起
,没有你我地球依然继续转
,心爱的人正在慢慢老去
,活着是为了带着微笑死去
,it's time to feel my broken heart
,betray my mind
,crawling in my soul and body
,it's time to light the night
,so let me get mine

,Hey commander, can you unplug me?
,Just for a minute, I need some privacy.
,Headset off and stretch her neck out
,Down the rocks to her head's safe house
,Yeah I remember it all
,Bleed and shout out my calls
,The air was so dusty
,Her armor getting rusty
,She found thoughts she never had
,Her young ones were just as bad
,She winced out her weapon
,Hole in her heart, feel like a lady
,Fingers apart, cold, rugged and waiting
,I can't believe it, Jim, how did you know where to find me?
,I kept the feelings in and really thought it had cost me."
,Drops in her goggles aren't of love
,Something's really wrong and it feels awful
,Even though her body's back to normal
,She once was a villain and it's hiding in her soul
,I don't want to know what she did
,She is not who I am
,At least that's what I thought
,Now I'm second guessing
,I can't put my gun down
,My suit's getting heavy
,Something wants to be released
,Something dark inside me ,Dark familiarity
,Something dark inside me, dark familiarity
,Something dark inside me, dark familiarity
,Something dark inside me, dark familiarity
,She opened her eyes and watched the ruins
,And thought of her life and love to lose
,She shook out her lenses, they'd want her back soon
,The moments alone becoming scarce and few
,Sure she could fight but she's getting visions
,Deeds that were unspeakable and personally did
,She couldn't pose a threat to the ghost like this
,He rescued her once, now it's her turn to save him

Avalon
  -Blackmore's night
  -"Under a Violet Moon"
To the days of Avalon
Where magic rules as king
The moon beneath the castle walls
As the nightingale sings...
The golden bird
He gave to me
What happiness he brings
Like a star on a Christmas tree
As the nightingale sings
And so we sat, hand in hand and watched the fireflies
And never spoke a single word
But lived to do or die
We lived to do or die

Back to the days of Avalon
Where magic ruled as king
The moon beneath the castle walls
As the nightingale sings...
And so we sat, hand in hand and watched the fireflies
And never spoke a single word
But lived to do or die
We lived to do or die

We read of tales of treason
A soldiers legacy
Blood beneath the crimson sky
Fighting without reason
But the crime of loyalty
A tattered flag left to fly...
Back to the days of Avalon
Where magic ruled as king
The moon beneath the castles walls
As the nightingale sings...
The branches bent
Like an archers bow
As he spread his wings
And flew beneath the gentle snow
As the nightingale sings...
Back to the days of Avalon
Where magic rules as king
The moon beneath the castle walls
As the nightingale sings...
As the nightingale sings...
