,And the bright brace
,We got in summertime
,Seemed like a breath of fresh air,
,Back in the summertime.
,When we were more like brothers,
,but that was years ago.
,So if it doesn t sing like a broken chord
,L
,I'm running out of heart today.
,I'm running out of open roads to you and
,I know, you are emoting and your days.
,Is something broke inside you, cause at the moment
,I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
,If I'm losing you again.
,Oh when we fly tomorrow,
,over the Java sea,
,and my younger mass,
,will be there with me,
,'Cause they remind me of swimming
,out too far one day.
,Then, the cold was gone.
,But I didn't care anyways.
,I was running out of heart that day,
,I was running out of open roads to you and
,I know, I was emoting I was dazed.
,Is something broke inside me, cause at the moment
,I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
,If I'm losing you again.
,I'm running out of heart dear, you're just
,sitting out in the corn still doubting my day
,but I don't know what it is..
,I'll sweat it out the toxins. Is my
,Terracotta heart breaking? I don't know
,If I'm losing you,
,If I'm losing you again.

,On the last night on earth when the horses run free
,The scriptures foretell of a party in Hackney
,In a dimly lit room full with loathing and hate
,They're selling their souls and I just can't wait
,I shrivel inside at the sight of your beauty
,I fall to the floor as she's shaking her booty
,She said she,and then she, until I turned blue
,Oh , the things we get up to, to get through the night
,After you
,After you
,I knew it was wrong; I began to suspect
,When she reached over and pressed the eject
,I was up to the gunnels against all advice
,I felt so ashamed that I did it twice
,From disco to disco; from Safeway to Tesco
,We're shopping around from the cradle til death row
,From Tesco it's down to the 7-11
,To chase through the night time, to chase through the night
,After you
,After you
,I can't explain why I need to be free
,But if you need to be naked that's alright by me
,It's the fast track express to the graveyard, I know
,So what are you waiting for? Hey ho, let's go
,From disco to disco; from Safeway to Tesco
,We?re shopping around from the cradle til death row
,Don't stop til the train has pulled into the station
,Then I'll hold the door for you - no, I insist
,After you
,After you
,Woo~After you
,Oh,after you
,Yeah~After you
,After you
,After you
,After you
,After you...

,The lights go out and I can't be saved
,Tides that I tried to swim against
,You've put me down upon my knees
,Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing
,Come out of things unsaid
,Shoot an apple off my head, and a...
,Trouble that can't be named
,A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
,You are...
,You are...
,Confusion never stops
,Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
,Come back and take you home
,I could not stop that you now know, singing
,Come out upon my seas
,Curse missed opportunities, am I
,A part of the cure
,Or am I part of the disease? singing

,Walked off the stage
,Faded away into the clouds
,To the gig in the sky
,And when I arrived
,The angels were singing a song
,Yeah you know the one
,Are you singing along?
,Thought I’d know just what to do
,That it'd be how I wanted it to be of so new
,But counting me in
,I had to give in
,Make the thunder and lightning sing
,In the eye of the storm there’s no right and no wrong
,So long, so long
,Someday all the world will sing my song
,Still life remains
,Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on
,
,Thought it was the end of the world
,Deep with guitars and all that I understand is here
,Through mental un word I’m mis understood
,Wasting my money and fame
,I’d throw it away just to prove that I can
,I’m the last of a dying breed
,And it’s not the end of the world, oh no
,It’s not even the end of the day
,So long, so long
,Someday all the world will sing my song

Just walking the street and what do 
I findPeople walking in the wrong way
Grab something to eat, praying to her
Baby, someday, somewhere
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling down again
She brings me the music
And my feet won't touch the ground, oh, again
Ah, logic can't prove it
And I don't know where 
I am bound
She brings me the music
And now I'm floating in her sound
And now I'm floating in her sound
I love this town but 
I'm flying home
You know I take a little on my way
Well, boys, it's been sweet, love and death
We deal with our shit in our own ways
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling in her grace
Man, she don't prove it
She just walks in a room, you just see her face
She brings me the music
And I am slowly falling down again
She don't have to prove it'
Cause I'm falling in her sound
And I am a-falling in her sound
And I'm a-falling, falling, oh, baby
For you, falling, falling, oh, baby
Just a-calling you, calling you, oh, my baby
I'm a-calling, calling you, oh, yeah
Oh, I'm a-calling you, calling you, oh, baby
I'm just calling you, calling you, oh, baby
I'm just calling you, calling you all night
I'm just a-calling, calling, through the darkness
I'm a-calling you, calling you, oh, bring me home
I'm a-calling you, calling you, bring me home(I know I'm calling for you, now bring me home)
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home...

,When I find myself in times of trouble
,Mother Mary comes to me
,Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
,And in my hour of darkness
,She is standing right in front of me
,Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
,Let it be,
,Let it be, Let it be
,Let it be
,Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
,And when the broken hearted people
,Living in the world agree,
,There will be an answer, let it be.
,For though they may be parted there is
,Still a chance that they will see
,There will be an answer, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be.
,Let it be, Let it be
,There will be an answer, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be.
,Let it be, Let it be
,Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be.
,Let it be, Let it be
,Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
,And when the night is cloudy,
,There is still a light that shines on me,
,Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
,I wake up to the sound of music
,Mother Mary comes to me
,Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be.
,Let it be, Let it be
,There will be an answer, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be,
,Let it be, Let it be
,There will be an answer, let it be.
,Let it be, let it be,
,Let it be, Let it be
,Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
,Pardon me,
,I didn't realize what's in your eyes
,My arms are open wide
,But I can't ever decide what I want to do
,I'm staring at the sky
,But I can't tell which way my thoughts are traveling
,I try to listen to your words
,But I can feel my head and it's unraveling
,Sometimes I no longer know
,What it means to care about things you want to do
,Everybody's living or they're dead
,And I'm still in my bed
,And I don't have a clue
,I won't lie and tell you it's alright
,I won't lie and tell you it's alright

,Will you tear it down
,Will you decide

,So you tell me man is an island
,Stuck between sanity and asylum
,When the words you use won't work or fit
,They just hang around and always miss
,Retrace your steps again and again
,Your strength and virtue now coming to an end
,This purgatory, this constant battle
,Pack your bags, wave goodbye to struggle
,If the isolation destroys the worry
,If silence stops you saying sorry
,If the rain comes down and drowns the anxiety
,I'm giving up, I'm sailing to Caldey
,Show me some patience, give me some knowledge
,Show me what saves us, give me some courage
,If I could end with the grace of Leonard Cohen
,Then Caldey is the place, I can hear it calling
,So retrace your steps again
,Your strength and virtue now coming to an end
,This purgatory, this constant battle
,Pack your bags, wave goodbye to struggle
,If the isolation destroys the worry
,If silence stops you saying sorry
,If the rain comes down and drowns the anxiety
,I'm giving up, I'm sailing to Caldey
,If the isolation
,If silence
,If the rain comes down

,Welcome to Nirvana at the Beat hotel
,The sweet smell of Pernod, a Gauloise cigarette
,It's a cosmic congregation but you ain't seen nothing yet
,It's an open invitation, an existential clientele
,All looking for Nirvana at the Beat hotel
,They looked for it in New York City and San Francisco Bay
,They looked for in bebop jazz and it blew them all away
,They tried out every avenue and then said "What the hell,
,We'll look for it in Paris at the Beat hotel"
,Burroughs came up from Tangiers, Ginsberg from New York
,Kerouac came up from Italy and slept out in the park

,Fame is in a whisper when you pay the taxi fare
,It's just this side of Heaven and a long, long way from Hell

, 作曲 : Spoken Word
,San Francisco, in the middle of 60s,
,was a very special time and space to be a part of,
,but no explanation,
,no mix of words or musical memories
,can touch that sense of knowing
,that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world
,Whatever it meant
,it was madness in any direction
,at any hour
,you can strike sparks anywhere
,there was a fantastic universal sense that
,whatever we were doing was right
,that we were winning
,and that, I think, was the handle.
,that sins of inevitable victories over the forces of old and evil
,none of any mean or military sins, we didn't need that;
,our energy would simply prevail.
,We had all the momentum,
,we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave,
,so now, less than five years later,
,you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west
,and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high water mark
,that plays with the wave finally broke and rolled back
,
, Today, the Gods made me bleed again
, They chained my feet, so tight,
, I could barely move
, I bleed through my socks,
, last month was my left ankle,
, today it was the right
, When I wash,
, the soap burns like fire
, but I have to keep my ankles clean
, because I don't have any alcohol,
, or broxide
, nothing to kill a bacteria or infections
, and this place is filthy
, I can't remember what it's like
, to walk as a human being anymore
, my cell is so small
, that I can only take two steps
, any time when I'm brought out,
, I walk briefly or infrequently,
, I have chains on my hands and feet
, as well as guards hanging on me
, And well over sixteen years since I have barely walked anywhere
, sometimes I still can't read my mind about now
, I'm working on my seventeenth year now,
, There were times when I thought,
, "surely, someone's gonna put a stop to this.
, Surely someone is going to do something"
, But they never do
, Time just rolls on
, It's insanity
, I'm truly amazed of what they've gonna allow to get away with
, and for how long
, Oh well,
, there's no good to dwell on it
, either I waste my energy by focusing on things I cannot change
, or I can serve my energy
, and to bled to small things I can change.
, That's what the I Ching calls --
, the taming power of the small.
And she spread her wings and she flew
Yup, the nation was flying now
Taken to the air, in few hours time you could fly over
All those trails blazed by the pioneers
Phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day
Alexanders ragtime band
My mother was a lady and here's a song my mama sing
Back about 1910 or 1915
Come take a trip in my airship
Come take a trip round the stars
Come take a sail around Venus
Come take a sail around Mars
No one to watch while we're kissin'
No one to see while we spoon
Come take a trip in my airship
We'll visit the man in the moon

,Welcome to the Late Night Tales story – Undone
,Written by Anam Sufi, read by David Tennant
,Here is the truth. Exactly how I remember it
,And perhaps in being so, it is inevitably undone
,Here when the hour is late and the bottle long gone
,Where thoughts like constellations blur in and out of focus
,Nothing more than buoyant memories
,Acquiesced melancholy
,The shoreline recedes into darkness, betraying grains of the past
,They catch light of the moon
,Giving song and sparkle to this late night tale
,Here's the truth, I swear
,Word for word, picking through a pile of sedimentary emotion
,The crackle of fire, the cold in my bones
,And the pitter-patter of rain takes me back
,Echoes of footfalls crushing fallen leaves
,All that's left of the yellow wood racing back in time
,Back to where it all started
,The beginning of the end
,We'd set up camp between risk and consequence
,Reckless in the way that only youth can know
,Our hearts of cursor, pulsing, eager to forge the story of our lives
,There was no such thing as a photo without flash
,A song without bass or too much faith in the future
,Little did we know
,What happened over, what is felt is of little consequence
,The sheer impact remaining impervious to desire
,You to me, a hem caught by a hook in time
,Inexplicably attached
,Like the dead weight subscription of newspaper in a digital world of click stories
,And short glass love affairs
,The orchestra of our past carries on listlessly
,Erratic, yet somehow segued, like time
,And all of our choices embalmed incubate the senses
,The smell of your skin
,The sound of your breath
,The question mark curve in your ear
,Now these seem hollow, like the nape of your neck
,Where once I touched and felt you
,Alas. Remember the end, outside the Admiral
,I inhaled
,I exhaled
,Reflecting
,I didn't notice you arrive but you stood there alongside me as the rain fell down
,I don't think this was a good idea, I said
,Lying
,You shuffled your weight on both feet
,And I knew you wanted to say something
,I didn't let you
,And you disappear like mist suspended in sight
,Betrayed by my grasp
,How I wish I'd run after you and said
,"Hold me like you would a photograph, from the edges and lightly"
,Because anything more and I'll be stained
,Sullied by the desire of what would always and inevitably leave me undone

,You have been listening the Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for
,
,Followed you down to the end of the world
,To wait outside your window
,In the heat of the rain I will call your name
,But you just pass me by
,If you put me up like a fly on the wall
,
,You'll be to blame when the heavens fall
,Give me a sign that you hear me call
,But you just pass me by
,
,The colours around me are fading away
,And I'll be waiting, come what may
,I'll find you (I'll find you),
,Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
,If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone
,
,I followed the stars and I sailed to the sun
,With heaven in my fingers
,Alone on a beach, on my own out of reach
,But you just passed me by
,I'd give you the world if you take my hand
,But you left me alone in the sinking sand
,Strike up the band for one last stand
,But you just pass me by
,
,Show me the rules of the games you play
,I'll be waiting, come on lady
,I'll find you (I'll find you),
,Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
,If I've got to be the man who walks the earth
,I'll find you (I'll find you),

,If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone
,
,Followed you down to the end of the world
,To wait outside your window
,In the heat of the rain I will call your name
,But you just pass me by
,Wherever you run I'll be on your tail
,Wherever you're hiding behind your veil
,I'll find you (I'll find you),
,Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
,If I've got to be the man who walks the earth
,I'll find you (I'll find you),
,Yes I'll find you (Yes I'll find you)
,If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone
,I won't let your smile
,Get lost in the fall
,I won't let your dreams
,Run away in the dark
,Still recall the way you were
,And that look in your eyes
,Still recall the way you were
,And that look in your eyes
,Can't hear the sound
,A thought ringing in my ear
,I still feel the pain
,I carried with me for years
,Still recall the way you were
,And that look in your eyes
,Still recall the way you were
,And that look in your eyes
,You could leave when the walls fall down
,I can tell by the look in your eyes
,You're alone on the rope
,And if you can't find no hope
,Don't look down
,Don't look down

,I can tell by the look in your eyes

,To catch the rain from a lonely waterfall
,But I might beware
,Cos they could drown me like a doll

,I feel like a Bona Fide
,Keeper of the right and wrong
,And I've known all along, but let me just make it clear
,Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution
,But faith in any god is gonna bury us all
,No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
,Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all
,Carry us all
,I slip my skin as the prophets reappear
,But I pay no mind
,I'm just trying to persevere
,With the sins I have to shake from me within
,Though I might beware
,Cos they're just trying to wear me thin
,They got me running in and out of time
,I feel like a Bona Fide
,Keeper of the right and wrong

,If they don't mind and you don't mind
,I'm gonna write that in a song
,But, can you keep a secret?
,On the cover of a magazine
,You wore a face that I've seldom seen
,You spilled your guts but you've got none
,You're driving round in a beat up car
,That you found on the road you run

,I do believe that you were wasting my time
,There’s no more tears left to cry myself blind
,If love is the law
,Then this is a crime
,Memories
,Forever set in stone
,When all is said and done
,They’re just like the fallen leaves
,That you gather in your head
,When the sun’s about to set
,I sail out on stormy seas

,Date night, I'll make it.

,You should know by now I'm a bad pretender for you

,She told me that it's all a part of the choices that your making
,Even when you think you're right
,You have to give to take
,
,But there's still tomorrow
,Forget the sorrow
,And I can be on the last train home
,Watch it pass the day
,As it fades away
,No more time to care
,No more time, today
,
,But we sing
,If we're going nowhere
,Yeah we sing
,If it's not enough
,And we sing
,Sing without a reason
,To ever fall in love
,
,I wonder if you're listening
,Picking up on the signals
,Sent back from within
,Sometimes it feels like I don't really know whats going on
,Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here
,
,But there's still tomorrow
,Forget the sorrow
,And I can be on the last train home
,Watch it pass the day

,If you'd get inside my head
,Then you'd understand
,Then you'd understand me
,Why I've felt so alone
,Why I kept myself from love

,So let me take you right now
,And swallow you down
,I need you inside
,If we had this night together
,If we had a moment to ourselves
,If we had this night together
,Then we'd be unstoppable
,Do you think that this is right
,Or is it really wrong
,I know that this is what we've been wanting
,And all this is burning in my soul
,It fills up to my throat
,It fills up till my heart is breaking
,If we had this night together
,If we had a moment to ourselves
,If we had this night together
,Then we'd be unstoppable
,Now, we can both learn
,Somehow, you'll see it's all we have
,Love, it keeps us together
,And I need love
,
,When I wake up without you
,Knowing you're not there
,I'm only feeling half as good
,Well I'm gonna find a way

,You make me feel alive

,I know how it feels to lie
,All I wanna do is trade this life for something new

,Yo yo what was that when I thought it was done?
,I thought it felt right, but the right was wrong
,All caught up in the eye of the storm
,And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
,And I don't even know what kind of things I said
,My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
,So picking up the pieces now where to begin
,The hardest part of that is starting again
,All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
,Holding on to what I haven't got
,This is not the end, this is not the beginning

,I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters
,Because I might be too busy trying to participate
,So, if this does end up being the last letter
,I just want you to know that
,I was in a bad place before I started high school
,And you helped me
,Even if you didn't know what I was talking about
,Or know someone who's gone through it
,It made me not feel alone
,Because I know there are people who say
,all of these things don't happen
,And there are people
,who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17
,I know these will all be stories someday
,And our pictures will become old photographs
,And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad
,But right now
,these moments are not stories
,This is happening
,I am here
,And I am looking at her
,And she is so beautiful
,I can see it
,This one moment when you know you're not a sad story
,You are alive
,And you stand up and see the lights on buildings
,And everything that makes you wonder
,And you are listening to that song on that drive
,With the people you love most in this world
,And in this moment
,I swear...
,We are infinite.

,Something’s crept in under our door
, Silent soaking through the floor
,
, Pinching like a stone in my shoe
, Some chemical is breaking down the glue
, That’s been binding me to you
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
,
,Well I thought that love watched over this house
, But you’re boarding up the windows now
,
, We’ve been leaning on each other so hard
, Tied so tight we wound up miles apart
, Making simple things so hard
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
, We’ve been disconnected somehow
,
,There’s an invisible wall between us now
, But I’ve been wrong and I’ve been down so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
,
,I see the landscape change before my eyes
, The features I’ve been navigating by
, No nothing looks the way it did before
, I don’t know where to look or what to look for
,
,I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind

,now for the final part of the four-part Late Night Tales story Flat of Angles
,written by Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I didn't know anything could be so perfect
,the lights of the Mirabal
,a thousand swirling eyes
,I dream of relaxing nights
,there are loads of people in my flat when I got home
,I'm already one for big crowds
,makes me want to retreat into my shell
,I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out
,this is a reconstruction
,I can't tell how it happened
,there are too many angles,too many reflections
,the harder I look at another,the more I see myself
,it feels like I'm here alone in this crowd
,myself projected round the room
,the Mirrorball,a beam splitter
,when contentment comes upon me ,I have to find ways to destroy it
,I slide the hairs in the coffee cup up its walls
,click the Catalan while it rushes and hisses
,I danced with spiders
,one of those spindly ones or legs and angles made up of lines is feasting on its prey caught up in a mesh
,the kettle clicks off
,my skin creeps and my head hurts
,I need to suffer more
,I was feeling too comfortable for a second there I guess
,he was there to save me
,alone in a freezing wooden flawed flat which I couldn't heat
,he sent me this Mirabal ordered on the Internet
,he came later
,I'd had no money for a fewdays
,he was desperate for a cigarette
,I remembered that when I was younger
,I'd hid some in a tin full of movie stubs
,and limited edition chocolate bar wrappers
,I found that in and inside was one single cigarette
,throwing the stuff aside
,I placed the cigarette carefully on my dry lips and patter caked my pockets in a panic
,located lighter and flicked the flame into existence
,I drew deeply tobacco and paper
,crackling my alveoli filled my blood vessels roared
,my scalp tingled and stomach turned
,hairs on my arm stood up and so did I
,lunging headfirst for the window flung open in one motion
,drinking down the black cool air as my mind shrieked
,I can't feel my arms
,now I'm here who's been a happy person
,I work hard and try not to let people down
,if they would not be there
,there would be no one to let down
,things have to be a certain way
,there is a beauty in order
,I've cleaned this flat today before leaving for work there
,I cleaned the storeroom arranged items in
,the window smile that the customers
,chose appropriate music wrap gifts gave
,change smile that the staff told them stories of my past
,smoked a cigarette by the bins,ordered sage colored visors from the parlaying catalogue
,lay down on the four-poster bed with no mattress
,glanced out of the window ,cleaned the windows ,warm some soup,dusted the labs ,waited for the Sun to set,counted listened locked
,and then it was time to walk home
,this is not my town ,but then again where is?
,these are not my people,but is anyone really?
,he is here again
,wind milling round the rooms
,knocking ashtrays over
,bellowing to be heard
,desperation in his eyes
,I know how he feels
,but he does something about it
,he gets out of his face ,waits for a gap in the conversation
,and jabbers his philosophy without solicitation
,our eyes meet across the room
,and I feel a little like the spider
,I gathered the spent cans in a blue plastic off-licence bag and smile as I stoop
,how is your weak beam
,well work was quite good sold the chiminea last and looking forward to tonight
,you've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for
,
,And now for the third part of four-part Late Night Tales story
,"Flat of Angles"
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benendict Cumberbatch
,I just can't access my thoughts
,Or put them into words
,I think now my brain recycle been awaiting deletion
,Still no reply to my text, I send to its ...
,Oh, let me see
,9:48, and it's now 10 o'clock
,She hasn't texted to me in response
,To my imploring, longing, yearning message
,full of wiring sudden grief
,Thus, morning!
,How are you
,I enjoyed our journey in the dark so can't wait this night!
,Back at my place, looking forward to the gig tonight
,what time can you get there?
,Where is Rhythm Factory?
,Have a great day!
,Kiss.
,As many questions as possible all crying out for response
,surface lightness, reflective even
,Asking after, referring to events our showing her I'm thinking of her
,The kiss bow
,That was contemplative for a good five minutes although we held hands briefly
,Near McDonald's on the Earl's Court Road last night
,I don't know that was to forward the kiss, too presumptuous now
,But, her touch, sent a clean electric impulse  through me
,up my arm, into my brain
,It cuts through the K, the sodium light
,the rain I longed to protect her from my arms
,Now he's check of the message this phone results
,a little clutch of pain somewhere of the sanity is heart
,The snails are climbing all over the wall in my bathroom
,There is a bush outside the window
,when it rains if I've left the window open
,which I need to, sometimes
,They crawl in
,The iridescent tracery they leave on
,Unknown journey sparkles in the bob light
,I take a Tesco-bag glove and gather them,
,bundle them out the window.
,My time spend with you before the war.
,She said she was going to Spain, hoped it wouldn’t rain,
,heard it wouldn’t rain. I wanted to go too,
,she said she was a solo traveler,
,But it was her rule,
,she goes on journeys alone.
,With plenty to read.
,I recommend some books, so that perhaps a thought of me would go with her.
,Perhaps I am the only thought she had.
,Or more probably, she never thought of me, as I did of her.
,I wanted to say these things,
,but there was always a wall around me,
,I could never tell people how much they meant to me.
,I could tell others how much I hated some people,
,but could never even tell a friend I appreciated their company
,until I’d had 10 cans, then it would descend into a stereotypical drunken
,“You’re my best mate, you are.”
,So we opened that bottle of absinthe, and sat on the couch.
,I knocked a copy of The Face onto the floor,
,and cleared away a few cans with my boots.
,We turned to face each other there,
,an my knee touched hers.
,I looked at our knees together,
,hers at the top of the black leather boots, hidden in grey woollen tights,
,with little bobbles on them.
,Her knee moved imperceptibly away,
,but I felt it.
,I looked up to her face
,as she said “Drink a shot with me, and look me in the eye as you do.”
,We did.
,I didn’t feel the effect of the alcohol,
,but her eyes gave me a warm glow,
,I was swallowed by them,
,as she swallowed the green liquid.
,I couldn’t get enough.
,We did it again and again.
,Rinse, then repeat.
,As needed.
,Well, we were fabric for a drama bass night
,we were about to bow about four
,Just getting our coats, when we were
,Tim getting some sorts of trouble
,with the coat room attendant, he lost his ticket
,She said "we'd have to wait until the end to get the coat
,So we had to sit outside
,by the meat market, in the freezing cold
,At least wear our coats
,Until 8, when it was finally over
,Tim's was only coat hanging around in the middle of this desert
,And then Tim, put his hand, in his jeans' pocket
,and pulls out a sweat rubbish ruffled ticket
,saying "I had it all along"
,Doug, saw this, he just screws his hands up into his face
,forces them to his side
,shaking, grating his teeth, groaning
,moving off slowly, muttering "fuuuuuuuu(ck)"
,Oh no, my number will be on her phone.
,They’ll know.
,I need to get round there and delete the calls.
,So it
,Out of the strong, came forth sweetness.
,It says that on the tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup.
,Have you ever noticed that?
,It has a picture of a lion, dead,
,surrounded by bees, buzzing around,
,and feasting on the lion’s innards.
,It is from a Biblical story,
,someone was going somewhere,
,saw the lion dead in the sunshine,
,and carried on.
,On his way back,
,the bees had started to form a hive within the lion,
,and were creating honey.
,Hence out of the strong...
,I have enough here to join her, to join the lion.
,I can’t walk around the block once more, again.
,I’ve been doing that for years, and I have never escaped.
,I don’t even know why I’m doing it.
,I’m going nowhere, like those snails, except out the window.
,The streets are full of mercenary eyes.
,Veins full of evil serum.
,90 degrees from window.
,Right down to its gables.
,You've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for.
,
,
,And now for the second part of the fourth part late night tale stories
,Flat of Angles
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,Is there any more drink around here?
,Do you have any?
,Its alright, I haven’t been to bed yet
,I’m not drinking in the morning!
,I swear I had a couple of…
,No I think I had them before I headed out last night.
,I sometimes feel like I am in the 1980s
,Or perhaps it's part  of my mom's fault watching Esatenders
,With  my family lying back on the green velour sofa
,Looking out at the sodium lights of the A505
,Hands fiddling with the glass on the tarnished aluminium of
,The Secondary double glazing thinking imagining romantic futures
,Set out for me by songs
,From top of the pops Twisted by lyrics of Genesis
,Starry starry nights
,Paint your pallid blue and grey
,Red and gold
,Are royal colors
,Yeah, yeah
,Industrial state
,Instead
,Anyway, like I say, it was great
,I was waiting in the corridor, to go to the toilet,
,Standing right in front of the door.
,It opened, and this girl was standing there.
,I was a little shocked, hadn’t expected it, and jumped a little.
,She did the same thing a second later, smiling.
,I tilted my head left, about to speak, and look sympathetic,
,And she tilted her head right.
,I raised my right hand, she raised her left.
,I put it back by my side, straightened my head,
,And she did the same.
,“I’ll be your mirror.” she said.
,Nothing else existed for a second there, I felt calm, and wanted no more.
,Then some chump who had slunk up the corridor goes
,“Awww, that is so cute!”
,I barged past her and slammed the door,
,Shot the lock across,the handle fell off.
,This can’t actually have happened.
,She is only 28.Only.
,What are we doing with our lives?
,Why are we carrying on like this?
,For God’s sake, why don’t we grow up?
,Pretending we are hip,
,Throwing our bodies around the room,around the town,
,Projected on cheap MDMA and ciders with ice, our shadows are long.
,They slip over the horizon, grow thinner,
,And disappear only the all-encompassing shadow of night takes over.
,That is greater than any of us.
,Then morning comes, and it goes away.
,It peels the film from eyes,
,Sparks cells into action,
,And eventually resurrects those who have avoided it.
,It says here is a day
,Do with it as you will.
,I am back, but she…
,I’m well up for keeping the session going
,Why did I even come back here?
,God knows.
,I’ll give her a call,
,See what she’s up to.
,We could swing down the Talbot for a few cures.
,Its ringing.
,Oh nooo… What happened?
,I think that…
,Hey! Where did you get to last night?
,Fancy a Bloody Mary at The Talbot?
,Give us a call when you get this!
,No. She wouldn’t move.
,I think I lied next to her.
,I lied.
,We had that methlathyl-whatever when I got out of the toilet.
,She had given that bloke the heave-ho.
,I can’t even remember her face.
,Just the strange flock texture on the wallpaper behind her in the corridor,
,The magnolia paintwork,
,The sick yellow light from a bare bulb,
,And decades of greasy black hand marks by the top of the stairs.
,Her eyes were…
,Black.
,
or worse, someone who knows me walks by.
,I hope you enjoy the finally files Late Night Tales selection
,Welcome
,To the first part of the four part late night tell story Flat of Angles
,Written by  Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I’ll miss you,
,I’ll miss our walks,
,trying to pretend we are in perfect step.
,Out of step now,
,sick on the floor,
,out of the room,
,fenced in, trapped.
,I can still hear the schoolchildren play outside at their usual 10:30.
,It always used to annoy me, as I was trying to sleep, but it doesn’t now.
,It seems alright.
,A replacement, a continuation.
,Their sound jangles around the room,
,it sounds so different from where I’ve been.
,A party, alone.
,Packed in with others, but never feeling so alone.
,People dance too close.
,She was there, I had only gone because I hoped she would be.
,I had arrived early, as the the streetlights were coming on,
,so I took a long walk around the block,
,taking a few extra lefts and rights,
,past the Chicken Cottage and the Costcutter,
,then along a crescent that arced me out of my way,
,past a group of figures huddled under the entrance to the flats,
,shielding the flicking lighter from the wind.
,This... area is little more than a traffic island,
,a triangle around which cars and coaches stream into town up the bleak Old Kent,
,or out into Kent and the coast.
,The same faces trudge around there for yeas.
,“Spare some change please? Much as possible.”
,“You want to buy some weed.”
,“Do you have a spare cigarette?”
,He always wants one.
,And that one about weed was not a question.
,There is a Samaritans office between two everely dilapidated buildings on a black-bricked terrace.
,It has a thermometer painted on a 10 ft wooden board nailed to the outside.
,There is red paint up to the ￡0 mark, and, an ambitious 10 ft higher,
,is written ￡200,000. It never got any warmer there.
,The Man begging in the corner makes me take a huge detour when going towards my flat.
,He looks up with a pitiful stare that makes me want to kick the misery out of him.
,His dipit wee cup of unwanted coffee.
,A child’s sleeping bag.
,JJB sports.
,A crack, a release, his poor exhaust.
,He was lost.
,The Broadway.
,The Town Hall, such a grand building, all nautical reminiscences, here, far from water.
,It would be quite a sight if you could get far back enough from it to take a look.
,But my back is up against the black panelling of the gay sauna opposite,
,a coach thunders by, and I run past the video shop that I owe ￡5 to.
,Meaning go way back.
,I may be becoming one of those people you see in New Cross.
,I have a book, peeping out of one pocket, at least want to look vaguely intellectual if someone I know,
,I throw down the finish can into the pile between two walls, outside my flat.
,Look, there’s the hardware store.
,It has a large cutout of a radiant man and woman in overalls,
,the woman handing the man a tin of paint, up his ladder, beaming.
,It has faded in the sun.
,I bought creosote from there, once.
,What a night!
,Pure ment..!
,It was messy!
,It was out of hand! It was out of space!
,I rapped on that track once, at Bagley’s, remember it?!Skibbadee handed me the mic,
,I got to shout “I’M GONNA SEND HIM TO OUTER SPACE TO FIIIND ANOTHER RACE!”
,Absolutely fantastic, those days…
,The pills these days are not the same, they don’t work.
,No love.
,I was chatting to this bloke in the kitchen, and he said something,
,I can’t remember what,
,but I had to push him over, crashed his arse on the coffee table,
,ash tinnies and CDs everywhere!
,Spilled the lines too, the fat bastard.
,I can’t get you out of my head,
,your loving is all I think about,
,no I can’t get you out of my head,
,something something is all I think about.
,I can’t get this loop out of my head,
,no I think I’ll have to…
,I need to sit down.
,I can’t stop my leg jiggling,
,it wants to be somewhere else.
,I need to get out of here.
,I can hear sirens – can you hear them?
,Then again, they are always here,
,the background to day to day life here.
,When music is playing, and they come,
,they sometimes sync up.
,The New Cross Remix, I call it.
,I used to... call it.
,This isn’t how it advertised itself.
,It was fun, it was Technicolour, the music made me feel liquid,
,I melted into the company and was chief among them.
,I was in the kitchen, pouring pint after pint of water over myself, insisting to a stranger that
,“No, no… The drinks are on me!”
,I can’t remember what happened after that.
,Except her there. I had managed to talk to her,
,I was talking about an art gallery, I thought she’d be impressed,
,but her eyes kept dancing around the space behind me,
,smiles flickered on her lips as her eyes focussed on scenes I was oblivious to.
,I heard laughter. It was from my throat, but I didn’t feel it.
,I was just trying to breathe life into a long-dead persona.
,
,My heart aches,and a drowsy numbness pains
,My sense,as though of hemlock I had drunk,
,Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
,One minute past,and Lethe-wards had sunk:
,’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
,But being too happy in thine happiness,--
,That thou,light winged Dryad of the trees,
,In some melodious plot
,Of beechen green,and shadows numberless
,Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
,O,for a draught of vintage! That hath been
,Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
,Tasting of Flora and the country green,
,Dance,and Provencal song,and sun-burnt mirth!
,O,for a beaker full of the warm South,
,Full of the true,the blushful Hippocrene,
,With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
,And purple stained mouth;
,That I might drink,and leave the world unseen,
,And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
,Fade far away,dissolve,and quite forget
,What thou among the leaves hast never known,
,The weariness,the fever,and the fret
,Here,where men sit and hear each other groan;
,Where palsy shakes a few,sad,last gray hairs,
,Where youth grows pale,and spectre-thin,and dies;
,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
,And leaden-eyed despairs,
,Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
,Or new Love pine at them beyond tomorrow
,Away!away!for I will fly to thee,
,Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
,But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
,Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
,Already with thee!tender is the night,
,And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
,Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays;
,But here there is no light,
,Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
,Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
,I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
,Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
,But ,in embalmed darkness,guess each sweet
,Wherewith the seasonable month endows
,The grass,the thicket,and the fruit-tree wild;
,White hawthorn,and the pastoral eglantine;
,Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves;
,And mid-May’s eldest child,
,The coming musk-rose,full of dewy wine,
,The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
,Darkling I listen;and ,for many a time
,I have been half in love with easeful Death
,Call’d him soft names in many a mused rime
,To take into the air my quiet breath;
,Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
,To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
,While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
,In such an ecstasy!
,Still wouldst thou sing,and I have ears in vain—
,To thy high requiem become a sod.
,Thou wast not born for death,immortal Bird!
,No hungry generations tread thee down;
,The voice I hear this passing night was heard
,In ancient days by emperor and clown:
,Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
,Through the sad heart of Ruth,when,sick for home,
,She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
,The same that oft-times hath，
,Charm’d magic casement,opening on the foam
,Of perilous seas,in faery lands forlorn.
,Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
,To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
,Adieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well
,As she is fam’d to do,deceiving elf.
,Adieu! adieu! Thy plaintive anthem fades
,Past the near meadows,over the still stream,
,Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep
,In the next valley-glades:
,Was it a vision,or a waking dream?
,Fled is that music:--do I wake or sleep?

,Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Benedict Cumberbatch
,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
,A stately pleasure-dome decree :
,Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
,Through caverns measureless to man
,Down to a sunless sea.
,So twice five miles of fertile ground
,With walls and towers were girdled round :
,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;
,And here were forests ancient as the hills,
,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
,But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !
,A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
,By woman wailing for her demon-lover !
,And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
,A mighty fountain momently was forced :
,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
,Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :
,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
,It flung up momently the sacred river.
,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
,Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :
,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
,Ancestral voices prophesying war !
,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
,Floated midway on the waves ;
,Where was heard the mingled measure
,From the fountain and the caves.
,It was a miracle of rare device,
,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !
,A damsel with a dulcimer
,In a vision once I saw :
,It was an Abyssinian maid,
,And on her dulcimer she played,
,Singing of Mount Abora.
,Could I revive within me
,Her symphony and song,
,To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
,That with music loud and long,
,I would build that dome in air,
,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !
,And all who heard should see them there,
,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
,His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
,Weave a circle round him thrice,
,And close your eyes with holy dread,
,For he on honey-dew hath fed,
,And drunk the milk of Paradise.
,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
,All mimsy were the borogoves,
,And the mome raths outgrabe.
,'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
,The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
,Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
,The frumious Bandersnatch!
,He took his vorpal sword in hand:
,Long time the manxome foe he sought
,So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
,And stood awhile in thought.
,And as in uffish thought he stood.
,The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
,Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
,And burbled as it came!
,One, two! One, two! And through and through
,The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
,He left it dead, and with its head
,He went galumphing back.
,'And thou hast slain the Jabberwock?
,Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
,O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
,He chortled in his joy.
,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
,All mimsy were the borogoves,
,And the mome raths outgrabe.
,
,Well, I’ve never been a man of many words,
,and there’s nothing I could say that you haven’t heard.
,But I‘ll sing you love songs till the day I die.
,The way I’m feeling,
,I can’t keep it inside.
,I’ll sing a sweet serenade whenever you’re feeling sad,
,and a lullaby each night before you go to bed.
,I’ll sing to you for the rest of your life.
,The way I’m feeling,  I can’t keep it inside.
,No, I can't keep it inside.
,
,Remote and isolated，
,the islands of the South Pacific have a life of their own.
,Animals have been living in seclusion for so long,
,they've evolved in the most curious and surprising ways.
,But island living can carry a high price.
,Recently, some dramatic changes have been sweeping through these strange islands.
,At the western limits of the Pacific ocean,
, this is New Guinea, the world's largest tropical island.
,In these isolated jungles,
,there are creatures only recently discovered by westerners and mountains that they have never visited.
,This is the home of a mammal first seen by scientists as recently as 1994.
,Even the locals rarely see it, and it has never been filmed until now.
,It lives in trees, but it's not a monkey.
,Primates never made the jump across the water to this island.
, This is a rare glimpse of an almost unknown island oddity - the dingiso.
,
,About the size of a Labrador
,and with bear-like features
,it is amazingly a type of kangaroo, a tree kangaroo
,It lives at a higher altitude than any other kangaroo
,hence the woolly coat.
,Kangaroos usually feed on grass
,but here on New Guinea,
,they've climbed into the trees where the greenery is more abundant
,So the dingiso is a kangaroo which lives high in the mountains and climbs trees
,But then islands do have a habit of producing rather unusual animals
,Why?
,Because islands offer fresh opportunities to the creatures that find their way there.
,With no monkeys in New Guinea
,the freedom to browse in the trees has gone to the kangaroos
,
,New Guinea is a vast island nestled close to the continental landmass of Australia.
,As we move south and east, to smaller, more distant islands,
,the wildlife becomes even more unusual.
,The little-known island of New Caledonia is a small sliver of Australia
,that was cast adrift over 60 million years ago.
,It's home to a creature that seems to have evolved quite strangely.
,It has wings, but it can't fly.
,It is the kagu.
,Kagu families stick together,
,with young from previous years helping to declare the family territory.
,All intruders are chased away.
,It's the breeding season,
,when males rekindle the flame with their life-long partners.
,It's hard to know what the kagu is related to,
,a heron, a rail, or maybe a pigeon.
,Its closest relative may actually be the sunbittern of South America,
,7,000 miles to the east.
,
,She may not seem too impressed, but then,
,kagus always keep their feet very firmly on the ground.
,Their wings are too weak to get them airborne,
,but why fly when all the food you need is on the ground?
,And with no large predators stalking this island,
,there's not much cause to take flight.
,But this life is not without its worries.
,A newly hatched chick is hiding among the leaves.
,As with babies the world over, getting food into mouth can be quite a challenge.
,Perhaps slimy worms just don't appeal.
,The chick's camouflage helps to hide it from aerial predators like the New Caledonian crow.
,Fortunately, Dad's wings still have a use - to help him look big and intimidating.
,The kagu may be an island oddity,
,but with few prowling predators reaching the Pacific's isolated islands,
,flightless birds are more common here than anywhere else on earth.
,
,Islands are a topsy-turvy world,
,where evolution seems to follow a different set of rules.
,North of New Caledonia lies the Solomon Islands archipelago,
,a scattering of a thousand tropical islands.
,For the select few animals that arrived here,
,these were brave new worlds, filled with possibilities.
,And to make the most of what they found here,
,some adopted a whole new way of life.
,Among the successful colonists were skinks
,- lizards that are usually small with short legs.
,Quite a variety live here in the Solomons,
,but there is one in these forests that's unlike any other skink on the planet.
,The monkey-tailed skink is up to 50 times heavier than your average skink,
,and is the world's largest.
,Most skinks spend their lives on the ground, but not this monster.
,This is the only skink to possess a prehensile tail
,and unlike nearly all other skinks which dine on insects,
,this gentle giant is entirely vegetarian.
,
,As in New Guinea, there are no monkeys on these islands,
,so this skink simply filled the gap in the market and branched out.
,It even forms social bonds with other monkey-tailed skinks,
,a rare characteristic among reptiles of any description.
,This skink may be an oddity, but that is exactly why it thrives here.
,For a leaf-eater these islands are paradise.
,For others, though, life can be a little harder.
,Islanders only succeed by making the most of what's around them.
,Even spiders have their uses.
,On Santa Catalina Island in the Solomons,
,a fisherman prepares to go fishing.
,He seeks out a particular spider web,
,one that is strong and intricately spun.
,The fish he's after can't be caught on hooks,
,their mouths are too narrow.
,So he has to be creative.
,No rod or reel, just a kite,
,and the spider silk, wound into a lure.
,
,
,The spider-silk lure hangs below the kite,
,flitting across the water like an insect.
,Now he must steer the kite to where he thinks the fish are gathered.
,Somewhere, just beneath the surface, shoals of needlefish lie in wait.
,He keeps a close eye on the kite - if it drops, a fish is snared.
,No hook is needed.
,The sharp teeth and rough scales of the needlefish are tangled in the spider silk.
,It's clever, it's effective...
,..and many fish can be caught in this way.
,Their ability to adapt and find food both on land and at sea
,was crucial to the survival of the Pacific's first human colonisers.
,But it wasn't all plain sailing...
,the Pacific's more remote islands
,were some of the last places on Earth to be discovered by humans.
,And the island chain of Hawaii is the remotest of them all.
,These islands are so hard to reach that before humans arrived,
,only one new species of plant or animal turned up here every 35,000 years.
,For those lucky few that made it, this was a land of milk and honey.
,undefined
,
,This bird's beak is perfect for sipping nectar from tubular flowers.
,It's an 'I'iwi...
,a long-billed honey creeper only found in Hawaii.
,But when blown to these shores four million years ago,400
,its ancestors looked very different.
,Those first Hawaiian honey creepers were finch-like,
,with short bills, perhaps quite similar to this modern honey creeper, the palila.
,Its stout bill is perfect for ripping open tough seed pods.
,But once here, the honey creepers made the most of it,
,evolving into a variety of birds with some very distinctive bills.
,The Maui parrotbill has a strong, hooked beak
,for getting at the grubs inside dead wood.
,And then there's the 'akiapola'au,
,with one of the most remarkable beaks of any bird.
,Its lower mandible is straight and chisel-like
,and can puncture the bark to drink the sap...
,..while its upper mandible is long and curved for winkling out grubs.
,It's as close as a bill gets to a Swiss Army penknife.
,
,
,Amazingly,
,one single type of finch evolved into 58 different species and all because the birds that normally fill these roles,
,like hummingbirds and woodpeckers, never made it to these islands.
,Landfall in the Pacific is a risky business.
,Most islands are small, low and rather uniform,
,with few lifestyle choices on offer.
,But there is an archipelago that truly bucks the trend.
,Two of the largest islands in the Pacific have everything a castaway could dream of.
,Here lives a greater diversity of unique island creatures than almost anywhere else in the South Pacific.
,Forested valleys, turbulent rivers and glacier-topped peaks，
,this is New Zealand.
,A thousand miles long and with a mountainous spine rising one-and-a-half miles above the ocean,
,New Zealand offered a world of possibilities to creatures that found their way here.
,
,
,Alpine parrots, called ''kea'', after their calls.
,Living higher than any other parrots,
,these are possibly the world's most playful birds.
,But most of New Zealand's pioneering creatures were drawn to the forests below.
,And here, too, given the strange nature of life on Pacific islands,
,it pays to expect the unexpected.
,And the last thing you might expect to see here is penguins.
,These are Fiordland crested penguins, named after this corner of south New Zealand,
,They're on their daily trip to the sea.
,Despite hanging out in the forest, they haven't lost their taste for fish.
,So why are these woodlands so attractive to penguins?
,Because there are no large predators here,
,it's a safe place for bringing up baby.
,A freshwater stream through the forest makes a handy highway for a parent penguin heading home from a fishing trip with a crop full of food.
,undefined
,
,Born in the forest,
,they stay in the forest,
,while Mum and Dad bring fresh meals straight from the ocean.
,They can hear the waves,
,they can even smell the spray,
,but they have no idea what it looks like.
,These chicks won't have their first splash in the ocean
,until they're three months old,
,when they'll finally set off on their first fishing trip, alone.
,1,500 miles from the nearest continent,
,New Zealand is beyond the reach of most mammals.
,Marine mammals aside,
,the only ones that did succeed,
,before humans arrived, had wings.
,Bats.
,This is the short-tailed bat.
,It roosts in tree cavities and comes out at night to feed.
,So far, so normal.
,But these bats have been living the island life
,far too long not to have become a little ''different''.
,And they're not the only ones.
,Wetas are primitive relatives of the locust,
,but they can't fly.
,
,Seeing an opportunity,
,the bats pounced.
,After all,
,why waste energy hawking for insects in the sky,
,when there is such a feast on the forest floor?
,New Zealand's night-time creepy-crawlies are at the mercy of these bats.
,Some try to put up a fight
,but they're no match for this army of predators.
,These bats have special sheaths that protect their wings,
,all the better to burrow through the leaves.
,So even worms aren't safe.
,The very first bat evolved from a mouse-like mammal many millions of years ago.
,Here on New Zealand,
,it seems evolution has gone into reverse.
,And if New Zealand's bats have turned to mice,
,what on earth has happened to the birds?
,In these forests lives a bird that
,is about as un-bird-like as it is possible for a bird to be.
,It's nocturnal,
,though it sometimes wakes up before sunset.
,It has whiskers so it can feel its way in the dark.
,
,It's a parrot,
,and weighing up to four kilos,
,it's the world's heaviest.
,And yes, you've guessed it,
,it can't fly.
,Meet the kakapo.
,Too heavy and short-winged to get airborne,
,it climbs trees instead.
,Kakapo were once one of the most successful
,and abundant herbivores in New Zealand,
,the Kiwi equivalent of our rabbit.
,In 1899, explorer Charlie Douglas wrote,
,''They could be caught in the moonlight by simply shaking the tree
,or bush until they tumbled to the ground,
,like shaking down apples.''
,Its favourite food is up above,
,the tiny seeds of the rimu tree.
,This fruit fuels kakapo reproduction
,and they only breed when the trees produce a bumper crop,
,so about once every four years.
,Kakapo breed slower than any other bird,
,but they also live longer,
,sometimes more than a hundred years.
,The male's "song'' is as peculiar as the bird itself.
,
,More frog than parrot,
,it can be heard up to three miles away.
,In a breeding season,
,he will boom non-stop for eight hours every night for up to three months.
,But a female will only respond if there are plenty of rimu seeds about.
,So while these birds may nest in burrows like rabbits,
,unfortunately,
,they don't breed like them.
,And their numbers have dwindled dramatically.
,Today,
,fewer than a hundred kakapo survive and precious chicks receive a helping hand.
,Captive rearing has helped raise the number of kakapo from just 51 in 1995
,to the 91 birds alive today.
,They used to number in the hundreds of thousands.
,Today, their future is truly in our hands.
,So is this now an empty forest Actually,
,the trees are under attack like never before.
,There's a menace lurking amongst the foliage.
,During the day, it slumbers.
,But under cover of darkness,
,an invader is revealed.
,
,Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
,the mammals have finally arrived in force.
,Australian possums.
,Imported for their fur two centuries ago,
,they soon reached plague proportions,
,stripping trees of their vegetation.
,A war is being waged against them.
,Traps set and poison scattered.
,And yet they are now far more numerous than the kakapo ever were.
,A staggering 70 million possums overrun New Zealand's forests,
,where a bird failed, a mammal has succeeded.
,But why?
,The possums were unwitting immigrants,
,while the kakapo have lived here for millennia,
,perfectly adapted to this forest.
,It's an irony that is by no means unique to the kakapo and the possum.
,Right across the Pacific, similar scenes have been unfolding.
,Tiny islands off the coast of New Zealand
,are the last refuge for a host of animals
,now vanished from the two main islands.
,This is Stephens Island,
,one square mile of rock protruding from the ocean. （
,
,It's home to a living fossil,
,a relict,
,barely changed for over 100 million years. The tuatara.
,And half the world's population survive on this one island refuge.
,During the reign of the dinosaurs,
,the ancestors of the tuatara were everywhere.
,They survived the cataclysm that killed off the dinosaurs,
,but then couldn't compete with the mammals and died out.
,Everywhere, except on what was then a mammal-free New Zealand.
,Unlike mammals,
,tuatara live life in the slow lane.
,Days can pass when they barely move a muscle.
,Sometimes taking just one breath an hour.
,They feed on wetas,
,beetles and other invertebrates
,but don't appear very good at catching them.
,Even after millions of years of practice,
,eye-mouth co-ordination is not what it could be.
,"Survival of the fittest" just doesn't seem to apply here. “
,The tuatara's survival,
,first on New Zealand,
,now on Stephens Island,
,proves a point - islands are pretty safe places to be,
,at least until invaded.

,I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
,I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
,I know that it is out there
,There is got to be something for my soul somewhere
,I've  been looking for someone to share some lights
,Not just somebody just to get me through the night
,I could use some direction
,And I'm open to your suggestions
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart again
,I guess I am hoping you'll be there for me in the end
,Ho~
,Hu yeah~ ng~~
,There are moments when I don't know if it's real
,Or if anybody feels the way I feel
,I need inspiration
,Not just another negotiation
,
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart to you
,I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
,And if you help me to start again
,You know that I'll be there for you in the end
,Ho~
,Da da la ta la~
,Ho~

,I've seen the world
,Done it all, had my cake now
,Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now
,Hot summer nights mid July
,When you and I were forever wild
,The crazy days, the city lights
,The way you'd play with me like a child
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer young and beautiful
,Will you still love me
,when I got nothing but my aching soul
,I know you will, I know you will
,I know that you will
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer beautiful
,I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
,Channeling angels in, the new age now
,Hot summer days, rock and roll
,The way you'd play for me at your show
,And all the ways I got to know
,Your pretty face and electric soul
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer young and beautiful
,Will you still love me
,when I got nothing but my aching soul
,I know you will, I know you will
,I know that you will
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer beautiful
,Dear lord when I get to heaven
,Please let me bring my man
,When he comes tell me that you'll let him in
,Father tell me if you can
,Oh that grace, oh that body
,Oh that face makes me wanna party
,He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer young and beautiful
,Will you still love me
,when I got nothing but my aching soul
,I know you will, I know you will
,I know that you will
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer beautiful
,Will you still love me
,when I'm no longer beautiful
,Will you still love me
,when I'm not young and beautiful

,Мой бриллиант спит, лег рядом follow me.
,В унисон сихронный дайвинг.
,Мы не берем, только дарим, my diamond.
,Преданность прикрыта бронежилетом.
,Господь, Бог под одним небом.
,Время дороже золота, объятия Ангела.
,В любви дружба, все остальное грязное.
,Приобретенное опытом чужой рассы.
,Соль сладкая, был горький сахар.
,Настоящие чувства разные пазлы.
,Настоящие чувства хотел каждый.
,Моно или стерео судьбы когда ты один, а вас два, дотла.
,И если тело умрет раньше половины.
,Я продолжу жить в самом прямом смысле.
,Моя душа в ее сердце, в серидине.
,Память в поступках, плоть просто кейсы.
,И слова без действий пшик, полу-гейзер.
,Бесконечный мы э мэйзинг.
,Водопадами, удары МиМиМи.
,Мои милый мир ты, ты сохрани.
,В омут с головой, навстречу за мечтой.

,Piledriver Waltz
,
,
,
,I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
,And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
,I heard an unhappy ending
,It sorta sounds like you're leaving
,I heard the piledriver waltz
,It woke me up this morning
,
,You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
,And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
,Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
,If you're gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
,
,Mysteries flashing amber
,Go green when you answer
,But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
,
,I heard the news that you're planning
,To shoot me out of a cannon
,I heard the piledriver waltz
,It woke me up this morning
,
,You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
,And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
,Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
,If you're gonna try and walk on water make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
,
,Aaah, piledriver
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,As the cheerless towns pass my window
,I can see a washed out moon through the fog
,And then a voice inside my head breaks the analogue
,And says
,"Follow me down to valley below “
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
,I survived against the will of my twisted folk
,But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
,And said
,"Follow me down to valley below “
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
,"Follow me down to valley below ”
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
,"My David don't you worry ”
,This cold world is not for you
,So rest your head upon me
,I have strength to carry you"
,(Ghosts of the twenties rising Golden summers just holding you) （20
,"Follow me down to valley below ”
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
,"Follow me down to valley below “
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
,Come to us Lazarus
,It's time for you to go"
,It's time for you to go"
,The mirror's image
,It tells me it's home time
,But I'm not finished
,Cause you're not by my side
,And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
,Carrying your shoes
,Decided that once again I was just dreaming
,Of bumping into you
,Now it's three in the morning
,And I'm trying to change your mind
,Left you multiple missed calls
,And to my message you reply
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,High
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,Somewhere darker
,Talking the same shite
,I need a partner
,Well, are you out tonight?
,Gets harder and harder to get you to listen
,More I get through the gears
,Incapable of making alright decisions
,And having bad ideas
,Now it's three in the morning
,And I'm trying to change your mind
,Left you multiple missed calls
,And to my message you reply
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,High
,Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,And I can't see you here wondering where am I
,Sorta feels like I'm running out of time
,I haven't found what I was hoping to find
,You said you gotta be up in the morning
,Gonna have an early night
,Then you started to bore me
,Baby, Why'd you only call me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
,Arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
,And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
,She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
,And when she needs to shelter from reality
,She takes a dip in my daydreams
,My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
,That little lady sitting on the passenger side
,It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
,The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
,As Arabella, oh
,As Arabella
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
,You can't be sure
,Arabella's got a '70s head
,But she's a modern lover
,It's an exploration she's made of outer space
,And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
,And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place
,(That's magic) in a cheetah print coat
,(Just a slip) underneath it I hope
,(Asking if) I can have one of those
,(Organic) cigarettes that she smokes
,(Rubs her lips) 'round a Mexican Coke
,(Makes you wish) that you were the bottle
,(Takes a sip) of your soul, and it sounds like
,Just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
,You can't be sure
,Oh no, it’s not me
,I just forgot to tell you
,Didn’t mean, it seems obscene
,We just lost track along the way
,I’m coming to terms
,I’m starting to learn
,This ain’t all it’s cracked up to be
,’Cause I’m using you, you’re using me
,It’s never as easy as we believe
,’Cause this hurts, I can’t leave
,I understand, but can you
,I’m just scared, you’re lonely
,Everyone knows you’re better than me
,I’m coming to terms
,I’m starting to learn
,This ain’t all it’s cracked up to be
,’Cause I’m using you, you’re using me
,It’s never as easy as we believe
,Is this what you need?
,Am I what you need?
,I’m coming to terms
,I’m starting to learn
,This ain’t all it’s cracked up to be
,’Cause I’m using you, you’re using me

,Na na na na…

,I’m not the kind of fool who’s gonna sit and sing to you about stars, girl
,But last night I looked up into the dark half of the blue, and they’d gone backwards
,Something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
,Forcing them to get an early night
,I have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
,As the one I caught when I saw your
,
,Fingers dimming the lights
,Like you’re used to bein’ told that you’re trouble
,And I spent all night stuck on the puzzle
,Nobody I asked knew how we came to be the one to who you surrendered
,Any man who wasn’t led way in to the other room, stood pretending
,Something in your magnetism haven’t just made him drop
,Whoever’s hand it was that he was holding
,I have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
,As the one I caught when I saw your
,
,Fingers dimming the lights
,Like you’re used to bein’ told that you’re trouble
,And I spent all night stuck on the puzzle
,
,I tried to swim to the sand
,But my feet got caught in the middle
,And I thought I’d seen the light
,But oh no!
,I was just stuck on the puzzle
,Stuck on the puzzle
,
,Why do I have to fly over
,every town up and down the line?
,I'll die in the clouds above
,and you that I defend I do not love
,
,I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
,I was fighting but just fell tired to be fighting
,Guess I'm not the fighting kind
,
,Where will I meet my fate?
,Baby I'm a man and I was born to hate
,And when will I meet my end
,In a better time you could be my friend

,To be learned by heart
,by all children of men
,It's the hour of the morning
,on the day after the dawning
,When the sun they said would never set
,finally set again
,Was it Cromwell or Orwell
,who first led you to the stairwell
,Which leads only forever to kingdom come
,Rushed alone by guiding hands
,whispers of the promised land
,They wished you luck
,and handed you a gun

,Life could be so handsome
,Life could be so gay
,We're going nowhere

,Racking out the lines of shite
,Putting to right
,All of the world's great wrongs
,Yes we thought that they were brothers
,Then they half-murdered each other
,Then they did a karaoke turn
,And murdered our best song
,
,Told the governor's wife
,About the last night of his life
,She turned away in tears
,Called you a liar
,Where are all the old dreams now?
,The batallion, once so proud
,Lost in some old song

,And we got booted out the boozer
,Cause someone smashed the glass

,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Louder louder
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,
,To think I might not see those eyes
,It makes it so hard not to cry
,And as we say our long goodbye
,I nearly do
,Light up light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Louder louder
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,Slower slower
,We don't have time for that
,All I want is to find an easier way
,To get out of our little head
,Have heart my dear
,We're bound to be afraid

,You get a shiver in the dark
,It's raining in the park but meantime
,South of the river you stop and you hold everything
,A band is blowing Dixie double four time
,You feel alright when you hear that music ring
,You step inside but you don't see too many faces
,Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
,Too much competition too many other places
,But not too many horns can make that sound
,Way on downsouth way on downsouth London town
,You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords
,Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
,And an old guitar is all he can afford
,When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
,And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
,He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
,He can play honky tonk just like anything
,Saving it up for Friday night
,With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing
,And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
,Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
,They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
,It ain't what they call rock and roll
,And the Sultans played Creole
,And the man he steps right up to the microphone
,And says at last just as the time bell rings
,'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
,And he makes it fast with one more thing
,'We are the Sultans of Swing'
,
,There's gold in the city
,But never quite enough now to pay the rent
,You could've had it all
,But the pity is
,Everything you're gonna need is heaven sent
,Maybe the dream that we had is gone
,The people round here are like a setting sun
,They're picking you up when they're knocking you down
,But they can't stop me from loving you
,
,Do you want a butterfly
,The deals don't let it by
,You do the damage kid
,If love's what it's all about
,It's soul I can shock you now
,You do the damage kid
,
,Like a stone I was falling
,Would anybody come and get me out of here
,I waited in rain for the calling
,Would anybody come and get me out of here
,Maybe the dream that we had is gone
,The people round here are like a setting sun
,They're picking you up when they're knocking you down
,But they can't stop me from loving you
,
,Do you want a butterfly
,The dream's don't fly it by
,You do the damage kid
,If love's what it's all about
,It's soul I can show you now
,You do the damage kid
,Be my butterfly
,Please don't fly it by
,You do the damage kid
,If love's what it's all about
,It's soul I can show you now

,Every time that I see ya,
,A lightening bolt fills the room,
,The underbelly of Paris,
,She sings her favorite tune,
,She'll drink you under the table,
,She'll show you a trick or two,
,But every time that I left her,
,I missed the things she would do.
,
,She was the one - for me,
,She opened my eyes - to see,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.
,
,It was a cold September,
,Before the Indian summer,
,That's the thing I remember,
,When she gave me her number,
,Went from station to station,
,On a train 'cross the nation
,And the rain of November,
,That's the time that we ended,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.
,
,Vodka with Coca Cola,
,Cocaine tucked in her shoes,
,Cigarettes over coffee,
,Her halo slipped to a noose,
,Take a slow boat to China,
,You fly a rag 'round the moon,
,She could take it or leave it,
,I knew it had to end soon.
,
,She was the one - for me,
,She opened my eyes - to see,
,She was the one - for me,
,Well alright.

,
,Something’s crept in under our door
, Silent soaking through the floor
,
, Pinching like a stone in my shoe
, Some chemical is breaking down the glue
, That’s been binding me to you
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
,
,Well I thought that love watched over this house
, But you’re boarding up the windows now
,
, We’ve been leaning on each other so hard
, Tied so tight we wound up miles apart
, Making simple things so hard
,
,Uuuuuh
, I feel like I just don’t know you anymore
, But I’ve been burned and I’ve been wrong so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
, We’ve been disconnected somehow
,
,There’s an invisible wall between us now
, But I’ve been wrong and I’ve been down so many times
, We walk in circles,
, The blind leading the blind
,
,I see the landscape change before my eyes
, The features I’ve been navigating by
, No nothing looks the way it did before
, I don’t know where to look or what to look for
,

,Please don't see 　　
,just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies 　　
,Please see me 　　
,reaching out for someone I can't see 　　
,Take my hand， let's see where we wake up tomorrow 　　
,Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand 　　
,I'd be damned， Cupid's demanding back his arrow 　　
,So let's get drunk on our tears 　　
,And God, tell us the reason 　　
,Youth is wasted on the young 　　
,It's hunting season 　　
,And the lambs are on the run 　　
,Searching for the meaning 　　
,But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark? 　　
,I thought I saw you out there crying 　　
,I thought I heard you call my name 　　
,I thought I heard you out there crying　
,Just the same 　　
,And God, tell us the reason

,I really don’t think so
,that you’d think I’d be incapable
,of being on my own
,
,No…
,I really don’t think so
,that I would for a second let you
,back in through my door
,
,I have spent
,many a-nights even when
,you were by my side
,I shed tears I couldn’t dry
,I shed tears I couldn’t dry
,But I should thank you for
,taking my blindfold off
,now I ain’t jaded no more, no more
,And I take pride
,in bein’ the one that said goodbye
,that could only mean
,I am me, once more
,
,You would turn
,your head the other way
,so you wont have to listen
,to what I had to say
,You assumed
,that I needed you
,but you didnt realize that
,I needed no one but myself

,When you were very young,
,the world was younger than you,
,As merry as a carousel,
,The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky,
,Above the ring I loved so well.
,Now the young world has grown old,
,gone are the silver and gold,
,Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,
,Old girl, you're through.
,Just sit there and count your little fingers,
,unlucky little girl blue.
,Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you,
,It's time you knew,
,All you can count on are the raindrops that
,fall on little girl blue.
,No use, old girl, you might as well surrender,
,Your hopes are getting slender,
,Why won't somebody
,send a tender blue boy to cheer up little girl blue.
,No use old girl
,You might as well surrender
,'Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
,Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
,To cheer up little girl blue
,I waited 'til I saw the sun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I left you by the house of fun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,When I saw the break of day
,I wished that I could fly away
,Instead of kneeling in the sand
,Catching teardrops in my hand
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Out across the endless sea
,I would die in ecstasy
,But I'll be a bag of bones
,Driving down the road along
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Something has to make you run
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I feel as empty as a drum
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,There's no combination of words
,I could put on the back of a postcard
,No song that I could sing
,But I can try for your heart
,Our dreams--and they are made out of real things
,like a shoebox of photographs
,with sepia-toned loving
,Love is the answer
,at least for most of the questions in my heart
,Why are we here? and where do we go?
,And how come its so hard?
,Not always easy and
,sometimes life can be deceiving
,I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
,
,Chorus:
,Mmm' Its always better when we're together
,Yeah we'll look at the stars when we're together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,And all of these moments
,just might find their way into my dreams tonight
,But I know that they’ll be gone
,when the morning light sings
,or brings new things
,for tomorrow night you see
,that they’ll be gone too'
,too many things I have to do
,But if all of these dreams might find their way
,into my day to day scene
,I'd be under the impression
,i was somewhere in between
,With only two'
,Just me and you'
,Not so many things we got to do
,or places we got to be
,We'll Sit beneath the mango tree
,
,yeah its always better when we're together
,Mmm We're somewhere in between together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,
,I believe in memories
,they look so pretty when I sleep
,And when I wake up'
,you look so pretty sleeping next to me
,But there is not enough time'
,and there is no song I could sing
,and there is no combination of words I could say
,but I will still tell you one thing
,We're Better together
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,There's nothing for me, in this world full of strangers
,It's all someone else's idea
,I don't belong here, and you can't go with me
,You'll only slow me down
,
,Until I send for you, don't wear your hair that way
,If you cannot be true, I'll understand
,Tell all the others, you'll hold in your arms
,That I said I'd come back for you
,I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
,That's all that I can do
,
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,See the pyramids along the Nile
,Watch the sun rise from the tropic isle
,Just remember darling all the while
,You belong to me
,See the market place in old Algiers
,Send me photographs and souvenirs
,Just remember till a dream appears
,You belong to me
,And I'll be so alone without you
,Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
,Fly the ocean in a silver plane
,See the jungle when it's wet with rain
,Just remember till you're home again
,You belong to me
,(MUSIC)
,Oh I'll be so alone without you
,Maybe you'll be lonesome too
,Fly the ocean in a silver plane
,See the jungle when it's wet with rain
,Just remember till you're home again
,You belong to me
,Do you know what's worth fighting for'
,When it's not worth dying for?
,Does it take your breath away
,And you feel yourself suffocating?
,Does the pain weigh out the pride?
,And you look for a place to hide?
,Did someone break your heart inside?
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,When you're at the end of the road
,And you lost all sense of control
,And your thoughts have taken their toll
,When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
,Your faith walks on broken glass
,And the hangover doesn't pass
,Nothing's ever built to last
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,Did you try to live on your own
,When you burned down the house and home?
,Did you stand too close to the fire?
,Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
,When it's time to live and let die
,And you can't get another try
,Something inside this heart has died
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her,
,or anyone, or anything, yeah
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill

,I threw a wish in the well
,Don’t ask me I’ll never tell

,Through the crowd
,And I need you
,And I miss you

,If I could just see you... tonight
,It's always times like these
,When I think of you
,And I wonder if you ever think of me
,Cause everything's so wrong
,And I don't belong
,Living in your precious memory
,Cause I need you
,And I miss you
,And now I wonder
,If I could fall
,Into the sky
,Do you think time
,Would pass me by,oh

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off of love, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going?
,"I'm leaving you"
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great
,I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
,But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped
,Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even knows what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
,You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em
,Throw 'em down pin 'em
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's the rage that took over it controls you both
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over, it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pane
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,I'm just gonna
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,I let it fall, my heart
,And as it fell, you rose to claim it
,It was dark and I was over
,Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
,My hands, they were strong
,but my knees were far too weak
,To stand in your arms
,without falling to your feet
,But there's a side to you
,that I never knew, never knew
,All the things you'd say
,they were never true, never true
,And the games you'd play
,you would always win, always win
,But I set fire to the rain
,Watched it pour as I touched your face
,Well, it burned while I cried
,'Cause I heard it screaming out your name

,Summer in the hills
,Those hazy days I do remember
,We were running still
,Had the whole world at our feet
,Watching seasons change
,Our roads were lined with adventure
,Mountains in the way
,Couldn't keep us from the sea
,Here we stand open arms
,This is home where we are

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

  The continent of Atlantis was an island
 Which lay before the great flood
 In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
 So great an area of land, that from her western shores
 Those beautiful sailors journeyed to the South
 And the North Americas with ease
 In their ships with painted sails.
 To the east, Africa was a neighbor,
 Across a short strait of sea miles.
 
 The great Egyptian age is but a remnant
 Of the Atlantian culture.
 The antediluvian kings colonized the world;
 All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
 In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis.
 
 Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.
 On board were the Twelve:
 The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,
 And the other so-called Gods of our legends,
 Though Gods they were.
 And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,
 Let us rejoice and let us sing and dance and ring in the new . . .
 Hail Atlantis!
 
 Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be . . .
 Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be . . .
 
 My antediluvian baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah,
 I want to see you some day.
 My antediluvian baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah,
 My antediluvian baby.
 My antediluvian baby, I love you, girl;
 Girl, I want to see you some day.
 My antediluvian baby, oh yeah,
 I want to see you some day, oh,
 My antediluvian baby.
 My antediluvian baby, I want to see you;
 My antediluvian baby—gotta tell me where she gone—
 I want to see you some day,
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, oh yeah;
 Oh glub glub, down down, yeah . . .

,<Verse 1 : Peter Doherty>
,He was just a young boy in the city
,Clouds of smoke he sought to find his dreams
,Suedehead and his pipe he wove through the white city
,The hows-your-father bookie's runner scene
,<Verse 2 : Carl Barât>
,She was just a young girl in the city
,Struggling with life love and money
,Weaving through the streets and looking so so pretty
,The rummest sort Stockwell had ever seen
,The rummest sort Stockwell had ever seen... seen
,<Chorus>
,I've spent my days in the haze with the iceman
,I've spent my nights wandering the wards
,I've spent my days in the haze with the iceman
,It means the iceman is always on call
,
,<Verse 3 : Peter Doherty>
,She started work on the last day of November
,Spilling drinks in a seedy cabaret show
,He met her on the first day of December
,Outside a a bookshop on the Charing Cross road
,<Verse 4 : Carl Barât>
,Those winter nights they'd walk along the river
,He'd chain-smoke and she'd stare up at the sky
,And say this life, this love, this river has to end
,But just for now we have all the time
,Just for now we have all the time... time
,<Chorus>
,Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
,Don't spend your nights wandering the wards
,Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
,Because it means nothing at all

,<Bridge>
,Don't spend your days in the haze with iceman
,Don't spend your nights wandering the wards(Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman)
,Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman(Don't spend your nights wandering the wards)
,It means nothing at all

,Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
,Don't spend your nights wandering the wards
,Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman

,and stayed that way
,oh well, okay
,i got pictures, i just don't see it anymore
,climbing hour upon hour through a total bore
,with the one i keep where it never fades
,in the safety of a pitch black mind

,I've been searching
,The fossil that once was a fawn
,I've been waiting
,For the sun to rise up with the dawn
,Sleeping for 21 hours a day
,Fending the doctors away
,Bleeding decay
,Oh, sweet surrender
,Collapse to my knees
,Beg and plead
,Fill me with everything
,I threw this in the fire
,Fueled by my desires
,Gave it all away
,Led the flock astray
,Bent and broken vine
,Choking at the spine
,Oh, sweet surrender
,Collapse to my knees
,Beg and plead
,Fill me with everything

,What else could the ocean be
,What else is the sea
,But a hundred million drops of water
,What else but a memory
,Of faded memories
,Was everything that came before you
,And i dont know
,Where we'll go
,Or where we're gonna be
,I don't know, much at all
,but when i think of you
,I Do
,Roll the dice again to see
,The roads we gonna tread
,Then go whichever way you want to
,What else could i ever be
,But the man who lost his head
,And let his cold cold heart adore you
,And i don't know
,Where we'll go
,Or where we're gonna be
,I don't know, much at all
,But when i think of you
,I Do
,I won't fight it anymore
,As we wash up on the shore
,I still love you
,I Do
,What else could the ocean be
,What else is the sea
,But a hundred million drops of water
,With every word I live again
,Through the eyes of another
,We'll meet at night wet from the rain
,And surprise each other
,With how we take away the pain
,Could you be the one to find me safe and sound
,Love is how it's lost not how it's found
,I don't know those eyes
,But I see beauty there always
,I know it's wrong to love you from afar
,But it's a craze
,You recognize my pain
,Could you be the one to find me safe and sound
,Love is how it's lost not how it's found
,Love is how it's lost not how it's found
,You take away your pain
,Could you be the one to find me safe and sound
,Love is how it's lost not how it's found
,Love is how it's lost not how it's found
,Love is when i am lost not when i am found

,Don’t you think you’ve had enough
,The past and the present
,Doesn’t seem God sent
,You’re waiting but the times get tough
,Open up your eyes and say all your goodbyes
,As you walk outside the door to leave
,No, you never looked back
,Never took a real chance
,You just locked the door and took the key
,You can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun
,Hop in your car
,Turn the radio on
,Singing songs like we were singing along
,When the morning comes
,You’ll be so far gone
,Wish I would’ve got the chance to say
,That if you never come back
,I just want you to know
,I’m gonna love you either way
,Hey pretty momma
,Don’t you start cryin’
,Don’t let yourself go frail and weak
,There’s hope in tomorrow
,Happiness to borrow
,Till’ you you get to where you need
,I know your baby’s left
,But it’s really for the best
,It’s not the future that you wanted to see
,But maybe some day soon
,She’ll be back in this room
,And finally be the woman she outta be
,She can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun

,Hold your tongue we never swayed,
,pour the faults all away
,Cold in lungs and in face
,A golden heart, of what became?
,It was an awful lot for our young days
,Is it love you want 'cus it's love you've made
,The cheer within will find a home,
,the fear you bring burns below
,I can taste the wait and watch you waste away
,But I can't face the days, you were born astray
,It was an awful lot for our young days
,and what an ache i've made for a hollow embrace,
,with the blood you flaunt why would you stay
,I'm stackin' up on what i'll take,
,but the ballot doesn't hold your name
,You're wrapping up when winter fades,
,I'm holding on the callow ways.
,It was an awful lot for our young days.

,Fore go this ritual of silence,

,The night falls earlier these days,
,But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze.
,Drifting away me,
,My love will be waiting near so hungry,
,Throw away my necessities,
,And you will be in my past
,The nights fall easier your way,
,But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
,Oh you're paramount and i'm just shallow now in your tides,
,Oh you're paramount so leave me narrow and surmount my mind...
,And so we drift...
,Become individual,
,My vibrance is gone with the wind,
,We are numb, we have heard it all before,
,Our silence escapes your thoughts
,The night falls earlier these days,
,But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze.
,Oh you're paramount and i'm just shallow now in your tides,
,Oh you're paramount so leave me narrow and surmount my mind...
,Oh you're paramount and i'm just shallow now in your tides,
,Oh you're paramount so leave me narrow and surmount my mind...
,And so we drift...
,Well, I've never been a man of many words,
,
,and there's nothing I could say that you haven't heard.
,
,But I'll sing you love songs till the day I die.
,The way I’m feeling,
,I can't keep it inside.
,
,I'll sing a sweet serenade whenever you're feeling sad,
,
,and a lullaby each night before you go to bed.
,
,I'll sing to you for the rest of your life.
,
,The way I'm feeling,
,I can't keep it inside.
,No, I can't keep it inside.

,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
,All mimsy were the borogoves,
,And the mome raths outgrabe.
,'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
,The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
,Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
,The frumious Bandersnatch!
,He took his vorpal sword in hand:
,Long time the manxome foe he sought
,So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
,And stood awhile in thought.
,And as in uffish thought he stood.
,The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
,Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
,And burbled as it came!
,One, two! One, two! And through and through
,The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
,He left it dead, and with its head
,He went galumphing back.
,'And thou hast slain the Jabberwock?
,Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
,O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
,He chortled in his joy.
,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;

,And the mome raths outgrabe.

,Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Benedict Cumberbatch
,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
,A stately pleasure-dome decree :
,Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
,Through caverns measureless to man
,Down to a sunless sea.
,So twice five miles of fertile ground
,With walls and towers were girdled round :
,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;
,And here were forests ancient as the hills,
,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
,But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !
,A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
,By woman wailing for her demon-lover !
,And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
,A mighty fountain momently was forced :
,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
,Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :
,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
,It flung up momently the sacred river.
,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
,Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :
,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
,Ancestral voices prophesying war !
,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
,Floated midway on the waves ;
,Where was heard the mingled measure
,From the fountain and the caves.
,It was a miracle of rare device,
,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !
,A damsel with a dulcimer
,In a vision once I saw :
,It was an Abyssinian maid,
,And on her dulcimer she played,
,Singing of Mount Abora.
,Could I revive within me
,Her symphony and song,
,To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
,That with music loud and long,
,I would build that dome in air,
,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !
,And all who heard should see them there,
,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
,His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
,Weave a circle round him thrice,
,And close your eyes with holy dread,
,For he on honey-dew hath fed,
,And drunk the milk of Paradise.
,
,My heart aches,and a drowsy numbness pains
,My sense,as though of hemlock I had drunk,
,Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
,One minute past,and Lethe-wards had sunk:
,’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
,But being too happy in thine happiness,--
,That thou,light winged Dryad of the trees,
,In some melodious plot
,Of beechen green,and shadows numberless
,Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
,O,for a draught of vintage! That hath been
,Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
,Tasting of Flora and the country green,
,Dance,and Provencal song,and sun-burnt mirth!
,O,for a beaker full of the warm South,
,Full of the true,the blushful Hippocrene,
,With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
,And purple stained mouth;
,That I might drink,and leave the world unseen,
,And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
,Fade far away,dissolve,and quite forget
,What thou among the leaves hast never known,
,The weariness,the fever,and the fret
,Here,where men sit and hear each other groan;
,Where palsy shakes a few,sad,last gray hairs,
,Where youth grows pale,and spectre-thin,and dies;
,Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
,And leaden-eyed despairs,
,Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
,Or new Love pine at them beyond tomorrow
,Away!away!for I will fly to thee,
,Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
,But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
,Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
,Already with thee!tender is the night,
,And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
,Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays;
,But here there is no light,
,Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
,Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
,I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
,Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
,But ,in embalmed darkness,guess each sweet
,Wherewith the seasonable month endows
,The grass,the thicket,and the fruit-tree wild;
,White hawthorn,and the pastoral eglantine;
,Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves;
,And mid-May’s eldest child,
,The coming musk-rose,full of dewy wine,
,The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
,Darkling I listen;and ,for many a time
,I have been half in love with easeful Death
,Call’d him soft names in many a mused rime
,To take into the air my quiet breath;
,Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
,To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
,While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
,In such an ecstasy!
,Still wouldst thou sing,and I have ears in vain—
,To thy high requiem become a sod.
,Thou wast not born for death,immortal Bird!
,No hungry generations tread thee down;
,The voice I hear this passing night was heard
,In ancient days by emperor and clown:
,Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
,Through the sad heart of Ruth,when,sick for home,
,She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
,The same that oft-times hath，
,Charm’d magic casement,opening on the foam
,Of perilous seas,in faery lands forlorn.
,Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
,To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
,Adieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well
,As she is fam’d to do,deceiving elf.
,Adieu! adieu! Thy plaintive anthem fades
,Past the near meadows,over the still stream,
,Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep
,In the next valley-glades:
,Was it a vision,or a waking dream?
,Fled is that music:--do I wake or sleep?
,undefined
or worse, someone who knows me walks by.
,I hope you enjoy the finally files Late Night Tales selection
,Welcome
,To the first part of the four part late night tell story Flat of Angles
,Written by  Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I’ll miss you,
,I’ll miss our walks,
,trying to pretend we are in perfect step.
,Out of step now,
,sick on the floor,
,out of the room,
,fenced in, trapped.
,I can still hear the schoolchildren play outside at their usual 10:30.
,It always used to annoy me, as I was trying to sleep, but it doesn’t now.
,It seems alright.
,A replacement, a continuation.
,Their sound jangles around the room,
,it sounds so different from where I’ve been.
,A party, alone.
,Packed in with others, but never feeling so alone.
,People dance too close.
,She was there, I had only gone because I hoped she would be.
,I had arrived early, as the the streetlights were coming on,
,so I took a long walk around the block,
,taking a few extra lefts and rights,
,past the Chicken Cottage and the Costcutter,
,then along a crescent that arced me out of my way,
,past a group of figures huddled under the entrance to the flats,
,shielding the flicking lighter from the wind.
,This... area is little more than a traffic island,
,a triangle around which cars and coaches stream into town up the bleak Old Kent,
,or out into Kent and the coast.
,The same faces trudge around there for yeas.
,“Spare some change please? Much as possible.”
,“You want to buy some weed.”
,“Do you have a spare cigarette?”
,He always wants one.
,And that one about weed was not a question.
,There is a Samaritans office between two everely dilapidated buildings on a black-bricked terrace.
,It has a thermometer painted on a 10 ft wooden board nailed to the outside.
,There is red paint up to the ￡0 mark, and, an ambitious 10 ft higher,
,is written ￡200,000. It never got any warmer there.
,The Man begging in the corner makes me take a huge detour when going towards my flat.
,He looks up with a pitiful stare that makes me want to kick the misery out of him.
,His dipit wee cup of unwanted coffee.
,A child’s sleeping bag.
,JJB sports.
,A crack, a release, his poor exhaust.
,He was lost.
,The Broadway.
,The Town Hall, such a grand building, all nautical reminiscences, here, far from water.
,It would be quite a sight if you could get far back enough from it to take a look.
,But my back is up against the black panelling of the gay sauna opposite,
,a coach thunders by, and I run past the video shop that I owe ￡5 to.
,Meaning go way back.
,I may be becoming one of those people you see in New Cross.
,I have a book, peeping out of one pocket, at least want to look vaguely intellectual if someone I know,
,I throw down the finish can into the pile between two walls, outside my flat.
,Look, there’s the hardware store.
,It has a large cutout of a radiant man and woman in overalls,
,the woman handing the man a tin of paint, up his ladder, beaming.
,It has faded in the sun.
,I bought creosote from there, once.
,What a night!
,Pure ment..!
,It was messy!
,It was out of hand! It was out of space!
,I rapped on that track once, at Bagley’s, remember it?!Skibbadee handed me the mic,
,I got to shout “I’M GONNA SEND HIM TO OUTER SPACE TO FIIIND ANOTHER RACE!”
,Absolutely fantastic, those days…
,The pills these days are not the same, they don’t work.
,No love.
,I was chatting to this bloke in the kitchen, and he said something,
,I can’t remember what,
,but I had to push him over, crashed his arse on the coffee table,
,ash tinnies and CDs everywhere!
,Spilled the lines too, the fat bastard.
,I can’t get you out of my head,
,your loving is all I think about,
,no I can’t get you out of my head,
,something something is all I think about.
,I can’t get this loop out of my head,
,no I think I’ll have to…
,I need to sit down.
,I can’t stop my leg jiggling,
,it wants to be somewhere else.
,I need to get out of here.
,I can hear sirens – can you hear them?
,Then again, they are always here,
,the background to day to day life here.
,When music is playing, and they come,
,they sometimes sync up.
,The New Cross Remix, I call it.
,I used to... call it.
,This isn’t how it advertised itself.
,It was fun, it was Technicolour, the music made me feel liquid,
,I melted into the company and was chief among them.
,I was in the kitchen, pouring pint after pint of water over myself, insisting to a stranger that
,“No, no… The drinks are on me!”
,I can’t remember what happened after that.
,Except her there. I had managed to talk to her,
,I was talking about an art gallery, I thought she’d be impressed,
,but her eyes kept dancing around the space behind me,
,smiles flickered on her lips as her eyes focussed on scenes I was oblivious to.
,I heard laughter. It was from my throat, but I didn’t feel it.
,I was just trying to breathe life into a long-dead persona.
,
,And now for the second part of the fourth part late night tale stories
,Flat of Angles
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,Is there any more drink around here?
,Do you have any?
,Its alright, I haven’t been to bed yet
,I’m not drinking in the morning!
,I swear I had a couple of…
,No I think I had them before I headed out last night.
,I sometimes feel like I am in the 1980s
,Or perhaps it's part  of my mom's fault watching Esatenders
,With  my family lying back on the green velour sofa
,Looking out at the sodium lights of the A505
,Hands fiddling with the glass on the tarnished aluminium of
,The Secondary double glazing thinking imagining romantic futures
,Set out for me by songs
,From top of the pops Twisted by lyrics of Genesis
,Starry starry nights
,Paint your pallid blue and grey
,Red and gold
,Are royal colors
,Yeah, yeah
,Industrial state
,Instead
,Anyway, like I say, it was great
,I was waiting in the corridor, to go to the toilet,
,Standing right in front of the door.
,It opened, and this girl was standing there.
,I was a little shocked, hadn’t expected it, and jumped a little.
,She did the same thing a second later, smiling.
,I tilted my head left, about to speak, and look sympathetic,
,And she tilted her head right.
,I raised my right hand, she raised her left.
,I put it back by my side, straightened my head,
,And she did the same.
,“I’ll be your mirror.” she said.
,Nothing else existed for a second there, I felt calm, and wanted no more.
,Then some chump who had slunk up the corridor goes
,“Awww, that is so cute!”
,I barged past her and slammed the door,
,Shot the lock across,the handle fell off.
,This can’t actually have happened.
,She is only 28.Only.
,What are we doing with our lives?
,Why are we carrying on like this?
,For God’s sake, why don’t we grow up?
,Pretending we are hip,
,Throwing our bodies around the room,around the town,
,Projected on cheap MDMA and ciders with ice, our shadows are long.
,They slip over the horizon, grow thinner,
,And disappear only the all-encompassing shadow of night takes over.
,That is greater than any of us.
,Then morning comes, and it goes away.
,It peels the film from eyes,
,Sparks cells into action,
,And eventually resurrects those who have avoided it.
,It says here is a day
,Do with it as you will.
,I am back, but she…
,I’m well up for keeping the session going
,Why did I even come back here?
,God knows.
,I’ll give her a call,
,See what she’s up to.
,We could swing down the Talbot for a few cures.
,Its ringing.
,Oh nooo… What happened?
,I think that…
,Hey! Where did you get to last night?
,Fancy a Bloody Mary at The Talbot?
,Give us a call when you get this!
,No. She wouldn’t move.
,I think I lied next to her.
,I lied.
,We had that methlathyl-whatever when I got out of the toilet.
,She had given that bloke the heave-ho.
,I can’t even remember her face.
,Just the strange flock texture on the wallpaper behind her in the corridor,
,The magnolia paintwork,
,The sick yellow light from a bare bulb,
,And decades of greasy black hand marks by the top of the stairs.
,Her eyes were…
,Black.
,
,
,And now for the third part of four-part Late Night Tales story
,"Flat of Angles"
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benendict Cumberbatch
,I just can't access my thoughts
,Or put them into words
,I think now my brain recycle been awaiting deletion
,Still no reply to my text, I send to its ...
,Oh, let me see
,9:48, and it's now 10 o'clock
,She hasn't texted to me in response
,To my imploring, longing, yearning message
,full of wiring sudden grief
,Thus, morning!
,How are you
,I enjoyed our journey in the dark so can't wait this night!
,Back at my place, looking forward to the gig tonight
,what time can you get there?
,Where is Rhythm Factory?
,Have a great day!
,Kiss.
,As many questions as possible all crying out for response
,surface lightness, reflective even
,Asking after, referring to events our showing her I'm thinking of her
,The kiss bow
,That was contemplative for a good five minutes although we held hands briefly
,Near McDonald's on the Earl's Court Road last night
,I don't know that was to forward the kiss, too presumptuous now
,But, her touch, sent a clean electric impulse  through me
,up my arm, into my brain
,It cuts through the K, the sodium light
,the rain I longed to protect her from my arms
,Now he's check of the message this phone results
,a little clutch of pain somewhere of the sanity is heart
,The snails are climbing all over the wall in my bathroom
,There is a bush outside the window
,when it rains if I've left the window open
,which I need to, sometimes
,They crawl in
,The iridescent tracery they leave on
,Unknown journey sparkles in the bob light
,I take a Tesco-bag glove and gather them,
,bundle them out the window.
,My time spend with you before the war.
,She said she was going to Spain, hoped it wouldn’t rain,
,heard it wouldn’t rain. I wanted to go too,
,she said she was a solo traveler,
,But it was her rule,
,she goes on journeys alone.
,With plenty to read.
,I recommend some books, so that perhaps a thought of me would go with her.
,Perhaps I am the only thought she had.
,Or more probably, she never thought of me, as I did of her.
,I wanted to say these things,
,but there was always a wall around me,
,I could never tell people how much they meant to me.
,I could tell others how much I hated some people,
,but could never even tell a friend I appreciated their company
,until I’d had 10 cans, then it would descend into a stereotypical drunken
,“You’re my best mate, you are.”
,So we opened that bottle of absinthe, and sat on the couch.
,I knocked a copy of The Face onto the floor,
,and cleared away a few cans with my boots.
,We turned to face each other there,
,an my knee touched hers.
,I looked at our knees together,
,hers at the top of the black leather boots, hidden in grey woollen tights,
,with little bobbles on them.
,Her knee moved imperceptibly away,
,but I felt it.
,I looked up to her face
,as she said “Drink a shot with me, and look me in the eye as you do.”
,We did.
,I didn’t feel the effect of the alcohol,
,but her eyes gave me a warm glow,
,I was swallowed by them,
,as she swallowed the green liquid.
,I couldn’t get enough.
,We did it again and again.
,Rinse, then repeat.
,As needed.
,Well, we were fabric for a drama bass night
,we were about to bow about four
,Just getting our coats, when we were
,Tim getting some sorts of trouble
,with the coat room attendant, he lost his ticket
,She said "we'd have to wait until the end to get the coat
,So we had to sit outside
,by the meat market, in the freezing cold
,At least wear our coats
,Until 8, when it was finally over
,Tim's was only coat hanging around in the middle of this desert
,And then Tim, put his hand, in his jeans' pocket
,and pulls out a sweat rubbish ruffled ticket
,saying "I had it all along"
,Doug, saw this, he just screws his hands up into his face
,forces them to his side
,shaking, grating his teeth, groaning
,moving off slowly, muttering "fuuuuuuuu(ck)"
,Oh no, my number will be on her phone.
,They’ll know.
,I need to get round there and delete the calls.
,So it
,Out of the strong, came forth sweetness.
,It says that on the tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup.
,Have you ever noticed that?
,It has a picture of a lion, dead,
,surrounded by bees, buzzing around,
,and feasting on the lion’s innards.
,It is from a Biblical story,
,someone was going somewhere,
,saw the lion dead in the sunshine,
,and carried on.
,On his way back,
,the bees had started to form a hive within the lion,
,and were creating honey.
,Hence out of the strong...
,I have enough here to join her, to join the lion.
,I can’t walk around the block once more, again.
,I’ve been doing that for years, and I have never escaped.
,I don’t even know why I’m doing it.
,I’m going nowhere, like those snails, except out the window.
,The streets are full of mercenary eyes.
,Veins full of evil serum.
,90 degrees from window.
,Right down to its gables.
,You've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for.

,
,
,
,
,now for the final part of the four-part Late Night Tales story Flat of Angles
,written by Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I didn't know anything could be so perfect
,the lights of the Mirabal
,a thousand swirling eyes
,I dream of relaxing nights
,there are loads of people in my flat when I got home
,I'm already one for big crowds
,makes me want to retreat into my shell
,I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out
,this is a reconstruction
,I can't tell how it happened
,there are too many angles,too many reflections
,the harder I look at another,the more I see myself
,it feels like I'm here alone in this crowd
,myself projected round the room
,the Mirrorball,a beam splitter
,when contentment comes upon me ,I have to find ways to destroy it
,I slide the hairs in the coffee cup up its walls
,click the Catalan while it rushes and hisses
,I danced with spiders
,one of those spindly ones or legs and angles made up of lines is feasting on its prey caught up in a mesh
,the kettle clicks off
,my skin creeps and my head hurts
,I need to suffer more
,I was feeling too comfortable for a second there I guess
,he was there to save me
,alone in a freezing wooden flawed flat which I couldn't heat
,he sent me this Mirabal ordered on the Internet
,he came later
,I'd had no money for a fewdays
,he was desperate for a cigarette
,I remembered that when I was younger
,I'd hid some in a tin full of movie stubs
,and limited edition chocolate bar wrappers
,I found that in and inside was one single cigarette
,throwing the stuff aside
,I placed the cigarette carefully on my dry lips and patter caked my pockets in a panic
,located lighter and flicked the flame into existence
,I drew deeply tobacco and paper
,crackling my alveoli filled my blood vessels roared
,my scalp tingled and stomach turned
,hairs on my arm stood up and so did I
,lunging headfirst for the window flung open in one motion
,drinking down the black cool air as my mind shrieked
,I can't feel my arms
,now I'm here who's been a happy person
,I work hard and try not to let people down
,if they would not be there
,there would be no one to let down
,things have to be a certain way
,there is a beauty in order
,I've cleaned this flat today before leaving for work there
,I cleaned the storeroom arranged items in
,the window smile that the customers
,chose appropriate music wrap gifts gave
,change smile that the staff told them stories of my past
,smoked a cigarette by the bins,ordered sage colored visors from the parlaying catalogue
,lay down on the four-poster bed with no mattress
,glanced out of the window ,cleaned the windows ,warm some soup,dusted the labs ,waited for the Sun to set,counted listened locked
,and then it was time to walk home
,this is not my town ,but then again where is?
,these are not my people,but is anyone really?
,he is here again
,wind milling round the rooms
,knocking ashtrays over
,bellowing to be heard
,desperation in his eyes
,I know how he feels
,but he does something about it
,he gets out of his face ,waits for a gap in the conversation
,and jabbers his philosophy without solicitation
,our eyes meet across the room
,and I feel a little like the spider
,I gathered the spent cans in a blue plastic off-licence bag and smile as I stoop
,how is your weak beam
,well work was quite good sold the chiminea last and looking forward to tonight
,you've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for
,
,Remote and isolated，
,the islands of the South Pacific have a life of their own.
,Animals have been living in seclusion for so long,
,they've evolved in the most curious and surprising ways.
,But island living can carry a high price.
,Recently, some dramatic changes have been sweeping through these strange islands.
,At the western limits of the Pacific ocean,
, this is New Guinea, the world's largest tropical island.
,In these isolated jungles,
,there are creatures only recently discovered by westerners and mountains that they have never visited.
,This is the home of a mammal first seen by scientists as recently as 1994.
,Even the locals rarely see it, and it has never been filmed until now.
,It lives in trees, but it's not a monkey.
,Primates never made the jump across the water to this island.
, This is a rare glimpse of an almost unknown island oddity - the dingiso.
,
,About the size of a Labrador
,and with bear-like features
,it is amazingly a type of kangaroo, a tree kangaroo
,It lives at a higher altitude than any other kangaroo
,hence the woolly coat.
,Kangaroos usually feed on grass
,but here on New Guinea,
,they've climbed into the trees where the greenery is more abundant
,So the dingiso is a kangaroo which lives high in the mountains and climbs trees
,But then islands do have a habit of producing rather unusual animals
,Why?
,Because islands offer fresh opportunities to the creatures that find their way there.
,With no monkeys in New Guinea
,the freedom to browse in the trees has gone to the kangaroos
,
,New Guinea is a vast island nestled close to the continental landmass of Australia.
,As we move south and east, to smaller, more distant islands,
,the wildlife becomes even more unusual.
,The little-known island of New Caledonia is a small sliver of Australia
,that was cast adrift over 60 million years ago.
,It's home to a creature that seems to have evolved quite strangely.
,It has wings, but it can't fly.
,It is the kagu.
,Kagu families stick together,
,with young from previous years helping to declare the family territory.
,All intruders are chased away.
,It's the breeding season,
,when males rekindle the flame with their life-long partners.
,It's hard to know what the kagu is related to,
,a heron, a rail, or maybe a pigeon.
,Its closest relative may actually be the sunbittern of South America,
,7,000 miles to the east.
,
,She may not seem too impressed, but then,
,kagus always keep their feet very firmly on the ground.
,Their wings are too weak to get them airborne,
,but why fly when all the food you need is on the ground?
,And with no large predators stalking this island,
,there's not much cause to take flight.
,But this life is not without its worries.
,A newly hatched chick is hiding among the leaves.
,As with babies the world over, getting food into mouth can be quite a challenge.
,Perhaps slimy worms just don't appeal.
,The chick's camouflage helps to hide it from aerial predators like the New Caledonian crow.
,Fortunately, Dad's wings still have a use - to help him look big and intimidating.
,The kagu may be an island oddity,
,but with few prowling predators reaching the Pacific's isolated islands,
,flightless birds are more common here than anywhere else on earth.
,
,Islands are a topsy-turvy world,
,where evolution seems to follow a different set of rules.
,North of New Caledonia lies the Solomon Islands archipelago,
,a scattering of a thousand tropical islands.
,For the select few animals that arrived here,
,these were brave new worlds, filled with possibilities.
,And to make the most of what they found here,
,some adopted a whole new way of life.
,Among the successful colonists were skinks
,- lizards that are usually small with short legs.
,Quite a variety live here in the Solomons,
,but there is one in these forests that's unlike any other skink on the planet.
,The monkey-tailed skink is up to 50 times heavier than your average skink,
,and is the world's largest.
,Most skinks spend their lives on the ground, but not this monster.
,This is the only skink to possess a prehensile tail
,and unlike nearly all other skinks which dine on insects,
,this gentle giant is entirely vegetarian.
,
,As in New Guinea, there are no monkeys on these islands,
,so this skink simply filled the gap in the market and branched out.
,It even forms social bonds with other monkey-tailed skinks,
,a rare characteristic among reptiles of any description.
,This skink may be an oddity, but that is exactly why it thrives here.
,For a leaf-eater these islands are paradise.
,For others, though, life can be a little harder.
,Islanders only succeed by making the most of what's around them.
,Even spiders have their uses.
,On Santa Catalina Island in the Solomons,
,a fisherman prepares to go fishing.
,He seeks out a particular spider web,
,one that is strong and intricately spun.
,The fish he's after can't be caught on hooks,
,their mouths are too narrow.
,So he has to be creative.
,No rod or reel, just a kite,
,and the spider silk, wound into a lure.
,
,
,The spider-silk lure hangs below the kite,
,flitting across the water like an insect.
,Now he must steer the kite to where he thinks the fish are gathered.
,Somewhere, just beneath the surface, shoals of needlefish lie in wait.
,He keeps a close eye on the kite - if it drops, a fish is snared.
,No hook is needed.
,The sharp teeth and rough scales of the needlefish are tangled in the spider silk.
,It's clever, it's effective...
,..and many fish can be caught in this way.
,Their ability to adapt and find food both on land and at sea
,was crucial to the survival of the Pacific's first human colonisers.
,But it wasn't all plain sailing...
,the Pacific's more remote islands
,were some of the last places on Earth to be discovered by humans.
,And the island chain of Hawaii is the remotest of them all.
,These islands are so hard to reach that before humans arrived,
,only one new species of plant or animal turned up here every 35,000 years.
,For those lucky few that made it, this was a land of milk and honey.
,undefined
,
,This bird's beak is perfect for sipping nectar from tubular flowers.
,It's an 'I'iwi...
,a long-billed honey creeper only found in Hawaii.
,But when blown to these shores four million years ago,400
,its ancestors looked very different.
,Those first Hawaiian honey creepers were finch-like,
,with short bills, perhaps quite similar to this modern honey creeper, the palila.
,Its stout bill is perfect for ripping open tough seed pods.
,But once here, the honey creepers made the most of it,
,evolving into a variety of birds with some very distinctive bills.
,The Maui parrotbill has a strong, hooked beak
,for getting at the grubs inside dead wood.
,And then there's the 'akiapola'au,
,with one of the most remarkable beaks of any bird.
,Its lower mandible is straight and chisel-like
,and can puncture the bark to drink the sap...
,..while its upper mandible is long and curved for winkling out grubs.
,It's as close as a bill gets to a Swiss Army penknife.
,
,
,Amazingly,
,one single type of finch evolved into 58 different species and all because the birds that normally fill these roles,
,like hummingbirds and woodpeckers, never made it to these islands.
,Landfall in the Pacific is a risky business.
,Most islands are small, low and rather uniform,
,with few lifestyle choices on offer.
,But there is an archipelago that truly bucks the trend.
,Two of the largest islands in the Pacific have everything a castaway could dream of.
,Here lives a greater diversity of unique island creatures than almost anywhere else in the South Pacific.
,Forested valleys, turbulent rivers and glacier-topped peaks，
,this is New Zealand.
,A thousand miles long and with a mountainous spine rising one-and-a-half miles above the ocean,
,New Zealand offered a world of possibilities to creatures that found their way here.
,
,
,Alpine parrots, called ''kea'', after their calls.
,Living higher than any other parrots,
,these are possibly the world's most playful birds.
,But most of New Zealand's pioneering creatures were drawn to the forests below.
,And here, too, given the strange nature of life on Pacific islands,
,it pays to expect the unexpected.
,And the last thing you might expect to see here is penguins.
,These are Fiordland crested penguins, named after this corner of south New Zealand,
,They're on their daily trip to the sea.
,Despite hanging out in the forest, they haven't lost their taste for fish.
,So why are these woodlands so attractive to penguins?
,Because there are no large predators here,
,it's a safe place for bringing up baby.
,A freshwater stream through the forest makes a handy highway for a parent penguin heading home from a fishing trip with a crop full of food.
,undefined
,
,Born in the forest,
,they stay in the forest,
,while Mum and Dad bring fresh meals straight from the ocean.
,They can hear the waves,
,they can even smell the spray,
,but they have no idea what it looks like.
,These chicks won't have their first splash in the ocean
,until they're three months old,
,when they'll finally set off on their first fishing trip, alone.
,1,500 miles from the nearest continent,
,New Zealand is beyond the reach of most mammals.
,Marine mammals aside,
,the only ones that did succeed,
,before humans arrived, had wings.
,Bats.
,This is the short-tailed bat.
,It roosts in tree cavities and comes out at night to feed.
,So far, so normal.
,But these bats have been living the island life
,far too long not to have become a little ''different''.
,And they're not the only ones.
,Wetas are primitive relatives of the locust,
,but they can't fly.
,
,Seeing an opportunity,
,the bats pounced.
,After all,
,why waste energy hawking for insects in the sky,
,when there is such a feast on the forest floor?
,New Zealand's night-time creepy-crawlies are at the mercy of these bats.
,Some try to put up a fight
,but they're no match for this army of predators.
,These bats have special sheaths that protect their wings,
,all the better to burrow through the leaves.
,So even worms aren't safe.
,The very first bat evolved from a mouse-like mammal many millions of years ago.
,Here on New Zealand,
,it seems evolution has gone into reverse.
,And if New Zealand's bats have turned to mice,
,what on earth has happened to the birds?
,In these forests lives a bird that
,is about as un-bird-like as it is possible for a bird to be.
,It's nocturnal,
,though it sometimes wakes up before sunset.
,It has whiskers so it can feel its way in the dark.
,
,It's a parrot,
,and weighing up to four kilos,
,it's the world's heaviest.
,And yes, you've guessed it,
,it can't fly.
,Meet the kakapo.
,Too heavy and short-winged to get airborne,
,it climbs trees instead.
,Kakapo were once one of the most successful
,and abundant herbivores in New Zealand,
,the Kiwi equivalent of our rabbit.
,In 1899, explorer Charlie Douglas wrote,
,''They could be caught in the moonlight by simply shaking the tree
,or bush until they tumbled to the ground,
,like shaking down apples.''
,Its favourite food is up above,
,the tiny seeds of the rimu tree.
,This fruit fuels kakapo reproduction
,and they only breed when the trees produce a bumper crop,
,so about once every four years.
,Kakapo breed slower than any other bird,
,but they also live longer,
,sometimes more than a hundred years.
,The male's "song'' is as peculiar as the bird itself.

,They were hanging on for grim life
,They were clutching at straws
,They were sure
,That the ship was at port
,As it sailed far from shore
,They were keen philosophers
,They were keen on hurt
,They were like a pair of dumb dogs
,Rolling in the dirt
,(That's) you and your idiot brother
,Waiting in the wing
,Which one holds up the other
,Which one pulls the string
,
,One bite of the apple
,One chop at the tree
,Is your word
,as good as your bond
,Your stammer, your honesty
,Nothing works for no one
,That won't work for me
,Nothing works for no one at all
,No one works for free
,Except you and your idiot brother
,Waiting in the wing
,Which one holds up the other
,Which one pulls the string? Oh
,
,We were getting on famously
,I was doing my bit
,They got no claim on me
,So send me a writ
,I was walking around your house
,In the middle of the night
,Home medicine, erotica
,Is your prescription right?
,That's you and your idiot brother
,Waiting in the wing
,Which one holds up the other
,Which one pulls the string? Oh
,
,I wanna kill your sister
,With some business advice
,Never doubt your loyalty
,On the telephone line
,And what about our fat friends
,With the golden ear?
,Upped and left, turned down your best shot
,Left you in arrears
,That's you and your idiot brother
,Without prejudice
,I can scarcely believe the situation
,Has come to this, oh
,
,You and your hideous brother
,A crutch of sympathy
,And on fire, you're no flier
,Just uselessly diseased, oh
,
,This is where the truth begins
,Where teardrops glance the sallow skin
,You lose your will
,And I can lend you mine
,The Westway wall's so tall and bleak
,Reflect the words we dare not speak
,By the bottle's end
,We may have done our time
,What you want is to stay away from people like me
,Who twist most everything they see
,And leave the gray old world behind you
,So sow it up, kid, have some clout
,We'll do some wine and fall about
,The sun will shine again tomorrow
,Oh, oh, oh,
,we'll look beyond the parapet
,We are just bums lest you forget
,We can beg, steal and borrow
,Well, you say the pills will sort me out
,Embolden me against
,The manifestations of fear and doubt
,I just forgot who I used to be
,So, now I'm strung
,Somewhere between a dream
,And the humdrum day to day routine
,A laurel wreath on the door to my heart
,What you want is to wash your face and try to breathe
,Forget your mind and shut your eyes
,so that you can see
,And leave the gray old world behind you
,So sow it up, kid, have no doubt
,We'll walk the line and have it out
,The sun will shine again tomorrow
,Oh, oh, oh,
,for all the friends you've ever met
,Some you'll love and some forget
,Just hold on for tomorrow
,So here's to now
,and all of us
,With our sweet hearts we tried to make a brand new start
,May the fabric never tear us apart
,And some day when
,we're in the cold
,Here's a semblance we can hope
,So pick a posy and put it on your heart
,for me
,So, now I move and if you're in
,It wouldn't hurt just to give it a try and win
,Don 't forget who you're meant to be
,What you want is to get a bike and do wheelies
,But I bet you can't do 'em half as good as me
,Throw it out when it's over, it's over
,So sow it up, kid, have some clout
,We'll go to mine and sulk about
,How the sun will shine tomorrow
,For all the friends you've not yet met
,Some would die for you, I'll bet
,So hold on for tomorrow
,So sow it up, kid, have some clout
,We'll go to mine and fuck about
,The sun will shine again tomorrow
,For all friends you've not yet met
,Some would die for you, I bet
,So hold on for tomorrow
,This is where the truth begins

,Cause the streets they're always there for us
,And it's quite scary
,When you wake up in the same old clubs
,It's getting darker
,And I know this time wasn't meant for us
,So won't you please please please come back to me
,
,But yesterday
,When i saw your eyes in a black haze
,You didn't even know my name
,So I walked on
,Pretending that you still belong
,But it will never be the same no more
,But we're all happy
,Cause the streets they're always there for us
,And it's quite scary
,When you wake up in the same old clubs
,It's getting darker
,And I know this time wasn't meant for us
,So won't you please please please come back to me
,
,It's like a picture of a loved one in disguise or
,It's like finding something pretty in a jar of lies
,And if you want just hide your eyes behind your hair
,But you can't see me then you can't find me anywhere
,But we're all happy
,Cause the streets they're always there for us
,And it's quite scary
,When you wake up in the same old clubs

,On a dark desert highway
,Cool wind in my hair
,Warm smell of colitas
,Rising up through the air
,Up ahead in the distance
,I saw a shimmering light
,My head grew heavy, and my sight grew dim
,I had to stop for the night
,There she stood in the doorway
,I heard the mission bell
,And I was thinking to myself
,This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
,Then she lit up a candle
,And she showed me the way
,There were voices down the corridor
,I thought I heard them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely place (background)
,Such a lovely face
,Plenty of room at the Hotel California
,Any time of year
,Any time of year (background)
,You can find it here
,Her mind is Tiffany twisted
,Shes got the Mercedes bends
,Shes got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
,That she calls friends
,How they dance in the courtyard
,Sweet summer sweat
,Some dance to remember
,Some dance to forget
,So I called up the Captain
,Please bring me my wine
,He said
,We havent had that spirit here since 1969
,And still those voices are calling from far away
,Wake you up in the middle of the night
,Just to hear them say
,Welcome to the Hotel California

,Theyre livin it up at the Hotel California
,What a nice surprise
,What a nice surprise (background)
,Bring your alibies
,Mirrors on the ceiling
,Pink champagne on ice
,And she said
,We are all just prisoners here
,Of our own device
,And in the masters chambers
,They gathered for the feast
,They stab it with their steely knives
,But they just cant kill the beast
,Last thing I remember
,I was running for the door
,I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
,Relax said the nightman
,We are programed to receive
,You can check out any time you like
,But you can never leave
,You're alone, you're on your own, so what?
,Have you gone blind?
,Have you forgotten what you have and what is yours?

,When I'm not too frightened

,They sing forgotten songs
,But I know the words
,They've been with me since I was born
,As I grew I danced with them too

,We were all lost
,Almost something so close
,On the outlines of your west coast
,We were waving red balloons
,We were wide-eyed
,Oh, we only lived in highlights
,A delusion, some were twilight
,We were dumb and beautiful
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,And no one else would ever do
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you
,That's something that I can't refuse
,It's something that I didn't choose
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be with you
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be
,I only wanna be with you
,We were perish
,We were subtle, we were drastic
,We were calm, we were dramatic
,We were fantasy and fear
,And you changed me
,You were sunny and you faced me
,Yeah, you saw me and encouraged me
,Like a tourist, souvenir (woah)
,Higher than the broken angels
,Flying with no parachute
,The minute that we felt like this when I knew

,Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
,But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer
,Is it true that 80 proof is the reason I'm with you?
,Oh, I know that I'll regret this when it's over
,Oooo-oooo ooo ooo(you know)
,Oooo-oooo ooo (story of my f**king life)
,I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
,Eazy
,Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
,But, the drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
,With every shot, they're like "Awh, here Kobe comes!"
,But I got this bad bitch trying to throw me buns
,If I listed to my Uncs, all them older ones
,They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)
,But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
,Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
,It all started with a light glass
,Now I'm asking "How long could tonight last?"
,Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
,If I had a shot less, then I might pass
,But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
,I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
,I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
,I take her to my room and I tell her "Get naked"

,I just know that I'll regret this when it's over
,Yeah uh
,I slipped up with my ex and I smashed again
,Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
,Walls built up around, they come crashing in
,Passed out at 6 A.M., but she's up at 10
,Doing this was not in my plans
,She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
,Hoop earrings, some just left on my nightstand
,Cussed me out and stormed off like "Alright then" (uh)
,On both sides, that was for 'em
,Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
,Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em
,When the sun comes down, then we transform
,Yeah, you can probably bet this
,By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
,Try, but it all falls down like Tetris
,No telling where an 80 proof gets us
,Oh, I know that I'll regret this when I'm sober
,But, every shot I'm getting closer, getting closer

,Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
,I miss you in my front seat
,Still got sand in my sweaters
,From nights we don't remember
,Do you miss me like I miss you?
,Fucked around and got attached to you
,Friends can break your heart too
,And I'm always tired but never of you
,If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
,I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
,I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
,I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
,
,Oh oh, keep it on the low
,You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
,If you wanted me, you would just say so
,And if I were you, I would never let me go
,I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
,Wedding bells were just alarms
,Caution tape around my heart
,You ever wonder what we could have been?
,You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
,Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges
,Just to create some distance
,I know that I control my thoughts
,And I should stop reminiscing
,But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,When love and trust are gone
,I guess this is moving on
,Everyone I do right does me wrong
,So every lonely night, I sing this song
,
,I hate you, I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you, I love you
,I hate that I want you

,Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter

,I'm so used to sharing
,Love only left me alone
,But I'm at one with the silence
,
,I found peace in your violence
,Can’t show me there’s  no point in trying
,I'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long

,My whole life, I've felt like a burden
,I think too much, and I hate it
,I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
,Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

, Can you hear them screaming out your name?
, Legends never die
, They never lose hope when everything's cold

, They run into smoke when the fire is fierce
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, They're written down in eternity
, But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives
, When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
, Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
, Oh, pick yourself up 'cause
,
, Legends never die
, Legends never die
, Legends never die

,South of your eyes
,North of your chin
,Yeah, I hear, what you're saying
,I'm taking it in
,
,Every single twisted word is
,All part of the dance
,The sanctuary of broken bird
,When nothing happens by chance
,
,I'm a liar too
,Yeah, I'm a liar too
,But then again
,So are you
,
,The story's told
,In so many ways
,It never really gets old but
,Let's just see how it flies
,
,There will never be a second first touch, no
,Saturday night
,Was all I really wanted, all I really asked for
,Now I'm killing the light
,
,'Cause I'm a liar too
,Yeah, 'cause I'm a liar too

, 作词 : Frey, Henley
,She came from Providence
,The one in Rhode Island
,Where the old world shadows hang
,Heavy in the air
,She packed her hopes and dreams
,Like a refugee
,Just as her father came across the sea
,She heard about a place people were smiling
,They spoke about the red man's way
,And how they loved the land
,And they came from everywhere
,To the Great Divide
,Seeking a place to stand
,Or a place to hide
,Down in the crowded bars
,Out for a good time
,Can't wait to tell you all
,What it's like up there
,And they called it paradise
,I don't know why
,Somebody laid the mountains low
,While the town got high
,Then the chilly winds blew down
,Across the desert
,Through the canyons of the coast,
,To the Malibu
,Where the pretty people play,
,Hungry for power
,To light their neon way
,And give them things to do
,Some rich men came and raped the land,
,Nobody caught them
,Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus,
,People bought them
,And they called it paradise
,The place to be
,They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea
,You can leave it all behind
,And sail to Lahaina
,Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
,They even brought a neon sign:"Jesus is coming"
,Brought the white man's burden down
,Brought the white man's reign
,Who will provide the grand design?
,What is yours and what is mine?
,Cause there is no more new frontier
,We have got to make it here
,We satifsy our endless needs
,And justify our bloody deeds,
,In the name of destiny
,And the name of God
,And you can see them there,
,On Sunday morning
,Stand up and sing about
,What it's like up there
,They call it paradise
,I don't know why
,You call someplace paradise,
,Kiss it goodbye
,The club isn't the best place to find a lover
,So the bar is where I go
,Me and my friends at the table doing shots
,Drinking faster and then we talk slow
,You come over and start up a conversation with just me
,And trust me I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
,
,Girl, you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
,Boy, let's not talk too much
,Grab on my waist and put that body on me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,Come—come on now, follow my lead
,
,I'm in love with the shape of you
,We push and pull like a magnet do
,Although my heart is falling too
,I'm in love with your body
,Last night you were in my room
,And now my bedsheets smell like you
,Every day discovering something brand new
,I'm in love with your body

,
,One week in we let the story begin
,We're going out on our first date
,But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
,Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
,We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
,And how your family is doin' okay
,And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
,Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
,
,Girl, you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead

,Reaching out but the past can't save you
,Wondering what all the empty souls do
,Nobody can be sure
,And if the words go around in circles
,When's the best time to stop just cut it off
,Quit searching for the cure
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,And if all this is really happening
,Look away we don't know where to begin
,Or what we're waiting for
,Awake, calling out your name
,Asleep, calling out your name
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Holding on just holding on
,Nothing left keep moving cause
,Who knows where those stepping stones go
,Forgetting how to swim
,I'm forgetting how to swim
,Holding on just holding on
,Hoping hope ain't all we got
,Who knows where those stepping stones go~

,All these lights that can't blind me
,With your love
,Baby you light up my world like nobody else
,The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
,But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
,You don't know oh oh
,And we danced all night
,To the best song ever
,We knew every line
,Now I can't remember
,How it goes but I know

,Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more
'Coz I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more
'Coz I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?

,
,Hello, I'm Neil. And I'm Helen. How are you Neil? Not good. What's wrong? I posted my house-keys. You posted your house-keys?
,Let me guess, you dropped them in the letterbox by mistake. Yes, I got mixed up. Instead of putting a letter in, I put my keys in.
,Oh dear. But I have my address attached to my keys, so maybe they'll end up getting posted back to me. Yes, you might get them posted back to your house or you might get burgled, now that someone has your address as well as your house-keys.
,Oh no, thieves might get into my house. I'd better go and wait outside to see what happens. OK, good luck. I'll keep you posted. See you later. Neil will "keep me posted".
,That doesn't mean he's going to put me in the postbox, even though he's obviously a bit confused about what should or shouldn't go in postboxes.
,It means he will keep me informed, he will tell me what happens. Listen to some examples. I don't know what time they're arriving, but I'll keep you posted.
,Keep me posted on how things go in your new job. I kept them posted on what was happening. I hope Neil's keys find their way home. Hello? Hi, it's Neil. Neil. Any news?
,Well, someone posted my keys back to me. Great. But they put them through the letterbox. Oh no, so you've got your keys back, but now you're locked out.
,And I'm stuck. I tried to get through a window but I don't fit. I'm half-in, half-out. Thank goodness, help must be arriving. Don't move. Does it look like I can move? Hands on your head.
,Oh dear, it sounds like someone called the police. They probably thought Neil was a burglar. But, this is my house. Is it indeed? I'd better leave you to explain yourself now.
,But do keep me posted Neil. Keep you posted. How am I going to do that if I'm locked up? Arrested for for breaking into my own house. Bye.
,
,Hi, I'm Helen, and welcome to The English We Speak. Sorry, I'll be with you in a minute, Chris. I'm just on the phone to Rob.
,Sure.
,Rob, do you need me to come and record with you in the studio this afternoon?
,No, don't worry. I've got Neil coming over to record with me.Everything's hunky-dory.
,Everything's what?
,Gotta go. Speak to you later, bye.
,OK, b-, oh, he hung up.
,Having a busy day, Helen?
,Yes, it's been so busy. I've got to move all these boxes. How's your day going?
,No problems really. I've finished my script and I've already recorded another programme with Rosie. I'm hunky-dory.
,Hunky-dory? That's what Rob just said to me. Neither of you is very hunky though.
,What?! Well, hunky means muscular doesn't it? Well yes, hunky is a slang word for describing someone who is muscular.
,So, you're not telling the truth when you say, I'm hunky… Dory. My name is not Dory though. Why do you call me that?
,I wasn't lying and saying "I'm hunky", and I wasn't calling you "Dory" either. The phrase hunky-dory doesn't have anything to do with being muscular. It's an informal way of saying something's fine or satisfactory.
,Ohhhh. It's a bit of a strange phrase though. Yes, it is. No one really knows where it comes from, other than it's believed to be an American phrase. I see. So how can you use it?
,Well, here are some examples.
,I was really worried I'd lost her, but everything's hunky-dory now. She was waiting for me by the car.
,Our washing machine broke last night. An engineer is coming to take a look at it today, so it should be hunky-dory soon.
,So you can use hunky-dory as an informal way to say that a situation is fine.
,Now I understand. Well, sadly nothing is hunky-dory for me. I've got all these boxes to move.
,Is that why you invited me here?
,Maybe?
,Hmm right then, let's get on with it. Right, where do you want them? Just over there, thanks.
,OK. Haha. My work will soon be done.
,
,Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Jennifer, and with me in the studio is, yawn, Helen.
,Hi Jen. Are you a bit tired? Oh yes, I really am. I've been here since seven this morning. I think I'm ready to call it a day now.
,What do you want to call it? Monday? Tuesday? Oh no, I don't mean. How about Saturday? That's my favourite day.
,Or we could call it a new day altogether. What about cake-day, or coffee-day. I don't want to rename the day.
,In English, if you're ready to call it a day, it means that you want to finish whatever you're doing, and usually go home.
,So you want to call it a day now? We haven't finished the programme yet. That's true.
,In that case, let's hear some examples of the phrase in action. We're getting nowhere with this.
,Shall we call it a day and start again tomorrow? I'm getting picked up from work at five, so I think I'd better call it a day.
,I see, so if you call it a day, you decide that it's time to finish the work you're doing. That's right, so let's call it a day right now.
,Alright then, do you fancy a quick drink after work? Well, I'm feeling pretty tired, but I suppose I could come out for one drink.
,Let's go then! Some time later... Jen, look at the time, we've been here seven hours. I know. I don't know where the evening went.
,It's probably time to call it a night. I thought the phrase was "call it a day"? We can also say "call it a night" if you've been somewhere in the evening and you know it's time to go home.
,Well, I definitely think that you need to call it a night, then. Although look. What? The sun is coming up already.
,We've been out on the town all night. Perhaps we should call it a day instead? That means it's nearly time for work again. Can I call in sick, please?
,
,Hello. I'm Rob. And this is Li.
,Hello.
,Now, the weather is so great today we're outside on the sea, sailing in this beautiful boat. So Li, what do you think?
,Wow, impressive. Rob, I didn't know you had a sailing boat. In fact I didn't know you could sail a boat.
,Oh, don't worry Li, I know what I'm doing.
,Oh mind that rock.
,Whoa,phew it's okay Li. I'm in control, just keep your hand on that rope.
,We've got the wind in our sails, the sea is calm. We can just easily sail around this island and be home in time for tea.
,Oh right. I thought our excursion was going to be trouble free, or plain sailing.
,What? Plain sailing? We're not sailing any planes Li.
, No Rob. Plain sailing. It's an expression used to describe an activity that goes well or smoothly and is easy and uncomplicated.
,Yes of course. This sailing is going well and is actually quite easy. So you're right. This is plain sailing.
,But can we only use the phrase to describe sailing boats?
, No. Although it was originally a sailing term, it can really refer to any activity. Listen to these examples.
,Driving through the city was difficult but once we were on the motorway it was plain sailing all the way.
,Once we found some office space and recruited staff, setting up our business was plain sailing.
, So plain sailing means things are going well.
, I have to admit Rob, your sailing skills are very good and, oh watch out for that big wave.
,Whoa, ouch. Oh oh, I've hit my head on the boom. Oh no, we're heading for the rocks again. Hold the rope Li, quick quick.
,I've changed my mind Rob, this isn't plain sailing anymore.
,That's taken the wind out of your sails Rob.
,Err, Li it's still windy. Look at the sails.
,No Rob. That's another sailing idiom, to take the wind out of your sails is an expression that means your boasting and arrogance has been challenged.
,Let's hear some other people using this expression.
,I was all ready for a big argument but when he bought me some flowers it took the wind out of my sails.
,The negative feedback from my boss has really taken the wind out of my sails.
,Hmm, so Li you've certainly taught me a lot about sailing today. There are some really good expressions, but one thing you haven't taught me is how to sail this boat.
, But you said you knew how to sail it.
,Well when I said I had been sailing several times I had, but I meant on a ferry, as a passenger.
,Oh, watch out.
,That was close. I've a feeling this really isn't going to be plain sailing after all.
,Too right. Bye bye.
, Bye. Now Li could you just hold that rope there.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.
,Presenting the programme with me today is Li.
,She hasn't arrived at the studio yet and I must say that I'm a bit nervous about her arrival.
,Something's happened to her recently. she's so unfriendly and even frightening. A real dragon.
,What are you saying? Why Neil, why are you not waiting for me?
,This guy, honestly, right, come on. I haven't got all day. Give me the script.
,Ah, hello, I'm Li. blah, blah, blah, this is rubbish as usual.
,Li, what's the matter with you?
,What do you mean? Can we get on with this please?
,Oh, what a dragon！
,What did you say?
,I said that you're a dragon, Li.
,No I'm not, I'm a rooster.
,No, I'm not talking about your Chinese zodiac sign, I mean your personality.
,Oh, oh, thanks.
,What?
,I said thank you.
,Li,I called you a dragen that's not a compliment
,Neil called me a dragon. To us Chinese this is a great compliment, but he says it's not. I wonder what he means.
,Listen to these examples and see if you can get the meaning.
,I'm never going to make my deadline with this report.
,You should speak to Kate to get an extension.
,But I'm too scared of Kate. She's such a dragon.
,That's true. She's so unfriendly and scary. She'll probably shout at you.
,Oh, that doesn't sound good. You should go to the Doctor's.
,I can't face dealing with that dragon at reception. She's always so rude and aggressive.
,Yeah, she's the last thing you want to deal with when you're ill.
,Ah, now I see that to call someone a dragon in English means something very different to Chinese.
,In those examples we have just heard they were using it to describe unfriendly and frightening women.
,Can this be right? Neil, are you calling me unfriendly and scary?
,Erm. yes. Recently.
,Not strong, courageous and determined? This is what we mean in Chinese when we call someone a dragon.
,No, I'm afraid not. We use 'dragon' to describe a woman who is unfriendly and frightening.
,Oh, that's very interesting.
,Yes it is, isn't it?
,oh,Hang on, hang on. What do you mean I'm unfriendly? How dare you call me unfriendly.
,Well, not usually but recently you have been.
,You just wait. I will get my revenge on you for this, you little upstart. Who do you think you are?
,Now you're getting scary.
,I'll show you what a dragon can do. OK, Li I think I'm going to leave now before you start breathing fire.
,Breathing fire? I'll burn you till you're toast.
,
,Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Helen.
,And I'm Steve. How are you, Helen?
,Actually, I'm feeling very positive, thanks Steve.
,Why? What's happened?
,Well, I found out on Friday that I'm getting a promotion at BBC Learning English, then on Saturday I won ￡1,000 on the lottery.
,Wow, that's brilliant.
,Yes, and then on Sunday it got even better. I found out that some paintings I've done are going to be displayed at an art gallery in London.
,That's amazing, Helen, you're on a roll at the moment, aren't you.
,Er, I'm on a what?
,On a roll.
,Roll? I don't roll. I walk, or sometimes I run if I want some exercise. A football rolls if I kick it across the ground.
,Sure, a football rolls, but you can be on a roll. It means you're experiencing lots of success or good luck at the moment.
,I see, the phrase 'on a roll' means you are having lots of good luck in your life. Let's listen to an example.
,I hear your sister's getting married.
,Yeah, she met this amazing guy while she was working in the theatre in London, and six months later they're engaged.
,And then, yesterday she was offered the lead part in the theatre's new play. She's really on a roll.
,So that woman is excited because her sister is on a roll, she met an amazing guy who she's now engaged to, and then she was offered the lead part in a play.
,Yes, if you're on a roll it means lots of things are going well for you at the moment. Here’s another example.
,How are Arsenal doing in the Premier League these days?
,Oh, they're totally on a roll. They've won all three games this month, including the one against Man United.
,So that man thinks his favourite football team are on a roll because they've won all their games?
,Yes, they've won every game they've played this month, they're playing really well.
,Oh, oh. Wait a second. I've got a text message from my husband.
,What's he saying, have you won the lottery again? Are you still on a roll?
,Sound effect of car braking suddenly.
,No, actually, he's just had his bike stolen, and earlier he lost his car keys.
,Oh, dear, that's bad luck! Unlike you, he's definitely not on a roll.
,No, I'd better go and help him look for those keys. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hi I'm Jennifer and I'm waiting for Helen. I did see her in the corridor earlier, and she was looking a bit unhappy. Wait, here she is.
,Hi Helen.
,Hi Jen.
,What's the matter, Helen? Why the long face?
,What's wrong with my face?
,Nothing's wrong with your face, except that it looks a bit upset.
,But you just said I've got a long face.
,No, what I said was.
,You think I've got a strange face. I knew I shouldn't have worn my hair like this today.
,No, I asked you, "Why the long face?"
,Is it my nose? Is it too big? Or maybe my chin is the wrong shape. Maybe I should just wear a big bag over my head.
,No, no, no. That's not what I meant. First of all, you look lovely today.
,So what did you mean?
,In English, the expression "why the long face" is used as an informal way of asking someone what's wrong if they look upset.
,So there's nothing wrong with my face?
,No, there isn't. Let's hear some examples of the phrase in use.
,You've just got a new job, a new house and a new man. you should be happy. Why the long face?
,Hey there, don't look so sad. Why the long face?
,So "why the long face" is just another way of asking "what's the matter".
,Exactly. You could also say "what's up".
,That's very simple. You could say "what's wrong" too.
,So what IS wrong? Why do you look so miserable?
,I've just had a really bad day. Everything has gone wrong. First I lost my car keys, then I was late for a meeting and I fell over and landed in a puddle on my way.
,It was a horrible day.
,It sounds awful. I know, how about I tell you a joke to cheer you up. You'll like this one.
,OK, why not. Let's hear it.
,A horse walks into a bar. The barman says, "why the long face?"
,So the horse was unhappy? What's funny about that?
,The barman says to the horse "Why the long face?"
,Why would a horse be in a bar?
,It doesn't matter. It's a joke. It's a horse so the barman says "Why the long face?"
,I don't understand.
,The horse has a long face.
, So it's unhappy?
,No, well, yes, but that's the joke. Horses have long faces.
,So why did it go into the bar again? I don't get it.
,
,Hello, I'm Helen and I'm here today to co-present The English We Speak and the presenter is Rosie. Where is she?
,Hi, I'm Rosie. Hi Helen. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic, you know?
,Is it that bad? I live in North London, like you, and I've managed to be here on time. Maybe you should take a different route so you wouldn't be late anymore.
,Yesterday you were a bit late too. And the day before. I saw when you arrived in the middle of an important meeting. This is not good.
,I know. The boss was not pleased and he called me afterwards into his office. He says he will throw the book at me.
,Oh, that's bad. That's very bad.
,Yes, it is. I'm very concerned now. I know that I should be more careful.
, They are very big. Have you seen these massive encyclopaedias he keeps on the dark wooden shelves behind his desk?
,He's not into electronic books and neither into those so-called paperbacks. The man likes heavy leather cover traditional books and old collectors' antiques and furniture.
,I know he likes antiques, that does not bother me.
,He's going to throw the book at me, Helen. He said it yesterday. He sounded very angry, very crossed and he said,
,"Rosie, it's happening too often now. You're always late for meetings, for programmes, you have been absent frequently and I'm going to throw the book at you."
,That's what he said, Helen.
,Oh, the books are heavy and you might get seriously hurt. He's a strong man, maybe he will throw the other things too.
,Oh, I don't like to see him angry. He is a good boss but he's got a temper.
,There's that Queen Victoria bust from the 19th century he loves. It's an antique too, if you get him angry enough he might even throw the bust on you.
,Queen Victoria's bust? Eh what are you talking about?
,Helen, in English, to throw the book at somebody means to impose the maximum penalty on somebody who has been breaking the rules.
,The book is supposed to be the list of rules and regulations and the expression is used by people in a position of authority. Let's listen to some examples.
,Mr Jones, I'm tired of seeing you in my courtroom! If you don't stop trying to steal cars I'm going to throw the book at you. You'll face a long prison sentence.
,I'm sorry, Judge. I think I've learnt my lesson now and will behave properly.
,I'm your teacher. Pay attention to what I'm saying. If you continue cheating in your exams I'm going to throw the book at you.
,Oh, I see. So he will not actually pick up that heavy Encyclopaedia Britannica and throw it in your direction and hurt you.
,Of course not. He probably will send me a formal letter and start disciplinary procedures with the human resources department and might end up sacking me.
,But at least you will not be hurt and the book will be preserved. I like that book, you know.
,When I was a child I used to enjoy looking up things in encyclopaedias, they're very interesting. This was before the internet was so accessible.
,It doesn't matter what happens to his old books, Helen. This is serious. It might not hurt me but it will hurt my pocket. No job, no money.
,Well, if you don't want him to sack you, then buy a watch and don't come late anymore. Follow the rules.
,And I don't want to finish the programme late. Nobody will throw the book at me. Goodbye.
,I will buy a new watch. Thank you for the advice. Bye.
,
,No, come on. Don't do it. Don't do it.
,Li, she's an actress in a film, she can't hear you. And besides, it's rude to talk in the cinema.
,But it's just so frustrating. Don't go into the house. Don't do it. Oh, no. I can't watch.
,Li, shut up.
,I know, he has shut her up in that house and won't let her go. She's his prisoner now.
,No, Li. I was telling you to shut up. It's a rude way of saying "Be quiet."
,Excuse me, will you please shut up?
,I'm really sorry. Li, I can't take you anywhere.
,Oh well look, the film is over now, anyway. Sorry about the talking, but I just get a bit carried away.
,Well, I'm sorry I told you to shut up. It is quite a rude expression in English, but you just kept talking and wouldn't shut up.
,So can I tell someone to shut up when they're making noise?
,You can, but it's informal and can be rude. So, if you're in a formal context, you should say something like "Could you please be quiet?"
,OK, so in a meeting, if someone is speaking, I won't tell them to shut up. I'll say, "Could you please be quiet?"
,But if I'm really annoyed at one of my friends, I can tell them to shut up.
,Yes, although sometimes it's used when people are joking in English. Let's listen to some examples.
,I'm so tired. And thirsty. When are we going to get there? If only you'd drive a bit faster.
,Will you please shut up? I can't concentrate with your constant moaning.
,I look fat in this dress. It's so clingy.
,Oh shut up! You look great.
,I just read the whole book in an hour.
,Shut up. No one can read that quickly.
,So in that first example, we heard the expression "shut up" used in a serious way.
,But in the second and third examples, it doesn't mean we want someone to be quiet. It means, "I don't believe you" or "Don't be ridiculous."
,So when someone says something silly or ridiculous, we can say "shut up".
,And again, we only really do this with people we know well as it is informal. You hav been warned.
,Well, one thing's for sure, I'm never, and I mean never, going to the cinema with you again.
,Shut up. I don't believe you. You love going to the cinema with me. I always buy you popcorn.
,Shut up. I always get the popcorn.
,Oh, shut up.
,You shut up.
,No you shut up.
,
,Hi, I'm Rob. And this is Helen.
,Hello.
,Now come on Helen, we've no time to waste. This jumble sale has nearly finished and we haven't got any bargains yet.
,Yes, all I've bought is an old teddy bear and a hat with a hole in it.
,A jumble sale is a great place to pick up some second-hand goods but make sure they are things you want. So what are you looking for Rob?
,Well, some antique pots and some vases. And then I can sell it to someone else and I'll be quids in.
,What? Quids in? What a strange saying.
,Well, it means I'll be in profit, or I will have made or saved some money through some kind of financial transaction.
,I like the sound of that. But did you say squids in, like the creature in the sea, a squid?
,No nothing like that Helen, the word is quids, it's a slang word for pounds. A quid is ?1. You might hear people talking about it like this:
,I'm broke so can you lend me a quid to buy a cup of tea, please?
,Come on ladies, who wants these lovely strawberries? Only two quid a box.
,So a quid is a pound and if I am quids in it means I will have made some extra pounds sterling.
,Ah, why didn't you say? Quids in means you could be rich.
,Possibly possibly. But let's hear some other people who are hoping to be quids in.
,If we complete this deal, we'll be quids in.
,With such a good exchange rate you'll be quids in when you go abroad on holiday.
,I paid ?50 for it but sold it for ?60 so I'm quids in.
,The English we speak.
,OK Rob, if we're going to be quids in today we need to get buying things.
,Did I say "we"? Anyway, look at this old vase, it's only ?10. I could clean it up and sell it for ?20.
,Sounds fantastic. We really would be quids in then. Come on then let's buy it.
,Right OK, so I've got my bargain for today, let's go home.
,Rob watch that step!
,Whoa. Oh no, my vase. It's broken.
,Oh. Do you think you'll be able to get ?20 for it now?
,No, I won't even get a penny.
,Rob won't be making a profit on selling his old vase now it's broken. Is there such an expression as being quids out?
,No there isn't. But there is an expression about being out of pocket.
,Hmm, I think we'll leave that for another day. Come on Rob I'll buy you a drink to cheer you up.
,Thanks Helen. See you next time on The English We Speak. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob.
,And hello I'm Li.
,Shh shh Li, quiet please. I need to concentrate, the race is about to finish and I've got a bet on. Yeah yeah. I've won. I've actually won. I'm rich.
,Well done Rob. So what have you won Rob?
,Ten pounds.
,Oh just ten pounds. Ah well, that's quite useful actually.
,Oh, is it. Why is that?
,Well, you owe me five pounds and you did say you would buy me a glass of champagne if you won a race.
,Oh right, did I? So, that will leave me with. 50 pence. Maybe I'm not a winner after all. Honestly! Every time I make some money I have to give it away.
,Sorry Rob, it's a no-win situation or a lose-lose situation. Rob, you can't gain any money because you'll always lose it on something else.
,So even though I did win something, I have also lost. So that's a no-win situation is it?
,I'm afraid it is. A no-win situation is one in which a favourable outcome is impossible. You are bound to lose whatever you do.
,You can also use this phrase to describe situations that aren't just to do with money, like this.
,I can get the bus or train to work, either way I'm going to be late. It's a no-win situation.
,The cafe only served ham or beef sandwiches but as a vegetarian I was in a no-win situation.
,If she helps in the garden, Mum won't be pleased and if she helps in the kitchen, Dad won't be pleased. She really is in a no-win situation.
,So a no-win situation is one that is certain to end in failure and disappointment. So Rob I can see you are disappointed because you have spent your winnings on me.
,Um, I am I'm afraid. It seems impossible to win money just for myself.
,Actually I also won some money, 50 pounds, so I'll buy you a drink, in fact I'll buy you something to eat too and you don't need to pay me back that five pounds.
,Really? Li that's very kind of you. So now I'm in a win-win situation.
,Yes, the opposite of a no-win situation is a win-win situation. This is where there is a favourable outcome for everyone involved. Like this.
,The house buyer got a good price and the seller was happy to sell quickly so it was a win-win situation.
,If I get to invest your money in the company and you get to share the profits, it's a win-win situation.
,So, in a win-win situation everyone is happy. Just like our situation now. So, where are you taking me for dinner Li?
,Did I say dinner? I was just going to buy you a sandwich.
,Oh. That's not such a good win-win situation, is it?
,Maybe I'll buy you some chips too.
,OK great. Come on then, let's go. Bye bye.
,Bye bye.
,
,Ah Vera, it's great that you've come with me during our lunch break to do some shopping. I need to buy a suit to go to a wedding and I have to look very smart.
,And I will make sure of that, Rob. Everybody says I have good taste. I've always chosen my husband's and my son's pyjamas and they look good while they sleep!
,Rob, I love that grey suit in the window.
,Wow. It looks really smart, actually. It will make me look great.
,Exactly! Let's go into the shop, you must try it.
,The colour suits you, Sir. I will see if I can find a smaller size so that it fits you perfectly.
,You see, Rob. This salesman knows what he is talking about. He thinks it looks good on you.
,But he is right, a size smaller would fit better. And everybody in the wedding will think you are a powerful man.
,Yes. Oh wait Vera, this suit is not for me. I'm reading this label and it says it costs an arm and a leg.
,An arm and a leg!? This is terrible, Rob. It's barbaric. This is the 21st century, not the Middle Ages.
,And the salesman seems quite civilised.He sounded like a nice man who wouldn't demand your limbs.
,Don't worry, Vera. I will keep all of my limbs. In English, when we say something costs an arm and a leg we mean that it is very expensive.
,So, it is something people say but it doesn't actually involve arms and legs. That's a relief.
,Let's hear some examples while I get back into my old clothes.
,I'd like to travel all over Europe, but the air fare might cost me an arm and a leg.
,You have to pay a lot of money to give your children a good education nowadays. A place in a top university costs an arm and a leg.
,So, what expression do you use when you want to say that something's very, very expensive?
,You might say it costs an arm and a leg.
,Yeah. Now let's leave this expensive suit here and get out of the shop before that posh-sounding salesman comes back.
,Good idea. He will look down on us, Rob. But I would pay a nail and an elbow for that scarf there and that red dress over there, it might cost a foot and a knee.
,Oh, look at that handbag. It's a designer one and must cost an ear and a hand.
,What are you talking about, Vera? We only say "an arm and a leg". Now, quickly, let's get out of here.
,OK, OK. Bye.
,
,Hi Helen. I thought I would pop round to talk to you about today's Authentic Real English, but err, it looks like you're busy.
,What are all these police cars doing here?
,Quick, come in, shut the door, now this is very serious. There has been a murder.
,What?
,A murder. I know it's not very nice, but to be honest the police can't find any blood or a body. It's like a murder mystery.
,Hmm,a murder mystery,well we need to do our own investigation. So what exactly happened?
,Well, my friend came to see me this morning.
,I see.
,And we were having a nice chat when she said I could murder a coffee and then she disappeared and I haven't heard from her since.
,Right. Well Helen, I think you can relax, I think she's still alive and everything is ok.
,There's no murder?
,No murder. When people say they could murder something it's an informal way of saying they are starving or thirsty and are desperate to have something to eat or drink.
,But murder is a strong word.
,Yes. It stresses how desperate someone is for something. A direct translation would mean you are so desperate for something you would kill it.
,But in reality, we don't go that far.
,Thank goodness.
,Here are some more examples.
,It's been a really tough day at work, I could murder a beer or two, anyone want to join me at the pub?
,I'm starving, I could murder a curry.
,the English we speak
,It's amazing what people will commit murder for. But in reality when we would murder for something, we just have a desperate need for something.
,People also describe a situation or a feeling as murder, but again there is no killing involved. They are just trying to explain that something is bad or uncomfortable.
,So the word murder is also used to emphasise a bad situation or uncomfortable feeling. Such as Rob?
,Such as in these examples.
,Running a marathon is murder on my knees.
,I've been decorating all day and my back is murder.
,Don't go on the London underground during the rush hour, it's murder.
,the English we speak
,So by saying "it's murder" he means it's awful. It's terrible. Anyway Helen, now we know there's not been a real murder, I think we should tell these policemen to go home now.
,Good idea. Excuse me, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. There's not been a murder so you can all go home.
,Oh right. So we've been wasting our time then? But hold on, I think there might be another murder soon.
,Oh, why's that?
,Well, I could murder a cup of tea.
,Of course.
,I'll put the kettle on. Bye.
,Bye.
,Policeman: Milk, two sugars please!
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. Rosie and I are doing a salsa class tonight. It's my favourite Latin American dance and I love the music.
,Yes, and it's not easy. One, two, three. Oh, I'm not very good yet. I'm still finding my feet.
,You're still finding your feet? No wonder you're so bad. How can you dance if you don't know where your feet are?
,I do know where my feet are, Helen. When you say you're finding your feet in English, it means you're becoming confident at something.
,So if I say I'm still finding my feet, it means I'm still getting used to a new situation, which might not have anything to do with feet?
,That's right. And when you say you've found your feet, it means you've become familiar with a situation.
,Let's have a look at some examples then.
,Lauren has only been at her new job for four days, so she's still finding her feet.
,My daughter started secondary school two weeks ago. She's already found her feet. She's made loads of new friends and really likes her teachers.
, I've been living in Egypt for a year but I still can't speak Arabic very well. I'm sure you'll find your feet soon.
,So finding your feet has nothing to do with your actual feet. You can use it when you start a new job or when you're doing something new.
,That's right. And I feel like I'm getting quite good at salsa now.
,Really? It looks like you're still finding your feet.
,I might ask someone to dance with me, Helen. That guy over there is pretty good.
,Hi, would you like to dance?
,Oh, OK.
,Oooooh this is fun. One, two, three.
,Oops
,Sorry. Did I step on your foot?
,Ouch.
,It looks like Rosie's doing more than finding her feet. She's finding other people's feet and stepping on them too.
,
,Hi, I'm Yang Li, and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm here today with Jen.
,Hi.
,Jen, you look a little flustered? Are you ok?
,Oh, I woke up late and had to run to the train station.
,There's only one train an hour. I ran all the way there and made it by the skin of my teeth, just as the doors were closing.
,Phew. Is there any coffee?
,Hang on hang on. How did your teeth help you to run for the train?
,Sorry?
,You said "I made it by the skin of my teeth." I've got to see this. Show me your teeth. When did they grow skin?
,No, there's no skin on my teeth. That would be disgusting.
,But but what did you mean?
,If you do something "by the skin of your teeth" it means that you did it by a narrow margin, so you just managed to do it, or almost failed.
,Ah see, so if you got to the train by the skin of your teeth, it means that you nearly missed it?
,That's exactly right. Let's hear some more examples of the phrase in action.
,My brother's so lucky. He never does any revision for exams but always manages to pass by the skin of his teeth.
,Hi, I'm stuck in a traffic jam. I might still make it to the presentation, but it'll be by the skin of my teeth.
,So when you just manage to do something, you can say you did it by the skin of your teeth?
,That's it.
,That's a really funny phrase. I like it.
,It's good to be able to get your teeth into English phrases like this.
,My teeth? What about my teeth?
,It's just another phrase, silly. If you get your teeth into something, it means that you become really involved in it.
,Well in that case, I do love getting my teeth into a new phrase.
,Teeth, hang on. Oh no, oh I've just remembered, I have a dentist's appointment at 12 o'clock.
,Look it's ten to 12 now, I'll never make it.
,You go, I'll finish the programme, if you run you might make it, but by the skin of your teeth.
,Oh thanks Jen, bye…
Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil. Presenting the programme with me today is Li. She hasn't arrived at the studio yet and I must say that I'm a bit nervous about her arrival. Something's happened to her recently. she's so unfriendly and even frightening. A real dragon. What are you saying? Why Neil, why are you not waiting for me? This guy, honestly, right, come on. I haven't got all day. Give me the script. Ah, hello, I'm Li. blah, blah, blah, this is rubbish as usual. Li, what's the matter with you? What do you mean? Can we get on with this please? Oh, what a dragon. What did you say? I said that you're a dragon, Li. No I'm not, I'm a rooster. No, I'm not talking about your Chinese zodiac sign, I mean your personality. Oh, oh, thanks. What? I said thank you. Li, I called you a dragon. That's not a compliment. Neil called me a dragon. To us Chinese this is a great compliment, but he says it's not. I wonder what he means. Listen to these examples and see if you can get the meaning. I'm never going to make my deadline with this report. You should speak to Kate to get an extension. But I'm too scared of Kate. She's such a dragon. That's true. She's so unfriendly and scary. She'll probably shout at you. Oh, that doesn't sound good. You should go to the Doctor's. I can't face dealing with that dragon at reception. She's always so rude and aggressive. Yeah, she's the last thing you want to deal with when you're ill. Ah, now I see that to call someone a dragon in English means something very different to Chinese. In those examples we have just heard they were using it to describe unfriendly and frightening women. Can this be right? Neil, are you calling me unfriendly and scary? Erm. yes. Recently. Not strong, courageous and determined? This is what we mean in Chinese when we call someone a dragon. No, I'm afraid not. We use 'dragon' to describe a woman who is unfriendly and frightening. Oh, that's very interesting. Yes it is, isn't it? Hang on, hang on. What do you mean I'm unfriendly? How dare you call me unfriendly. Well, not usually but recently you have been. You just wait. I will get my revenge on you for this, you little upstart. Who do you think you are? Now you're getting scary. I'll show you what a dragon can do. OK, Li I think I'm going to leave now before you start breathing fire. Breathing fire? I'll burn you till you're toast.
,
,Hi Helen. Wow, what's that?
,It's a present for you, Chris.
,A present for me? Oh, that's very kind of you.
,Here you go.
,A new dictionary, how nice. That's such a lovely present, and it's not even my birthday.
,But hang on, why have you stuck all these pieces of string onto the book?
,There are strings to your present.
,I see. Do you mean there are certain conditions that come with this present?
,Yes, strings to your present.
,Ahh, you mean there are strings attached.
,I see, so it's an expression in English?
,That's right. Having strings attached doesn't actually mean you need to stick pieces of string on the book.
,You can just tell me what the conditions are.
,Oh, OK. Well, the conditions are that I can borrow your dictionary whenever I need to use it.
,That's absolutely fine. You can borrow it anytime.
,Great. Do you have any headphones I can use too? I want to listen to my mp3 player.
,Yes, here you go.
,Thanks. Are there any strings attached?
,No, you can use the headphones for as long as you like. No strings attached.
,Wonderful, thanks very much.
,Let's take a listen to some examples of how strings attached or no strings attached can be used.
,Make sure you read all of the contract before you sign it, there could be strings attached.
,We're giving away our brand new toy to the first 50 customers who visit our shop. No strings attached.
,So it can be a warning about whether there are restrictions to something or not.
,That's right. When something has strings attached, it often means there are hidden commitments and you should find out what they are.
,That's good to know. Is it just used when talking about money?
,It can often be used when talking about financial agreements or negotiations,
,but it can also be based on personal relationships too, like when you gave me the present. Here's another example.
,My brother said I could use his car this weekend, no strings attached.
,Really? That's a nice thing to do.
,Well, he does owe me a favour after I washed the car last week.
,So Helen, now that you've finished with your mp3 player, can I listen to it?
,You can, but there are strings attached.
,Oh, OK. What are they?
,My mp3 player has only got classical music on it.
,Oh no, I hate classical music.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Rob.
,And hello, my name is Helen.
,Hold on Helen, hold on. We can't hear you properly. I think your microphone is playing up.
,Playing up?
,Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
,Let me just push this button. Oh There! Hello. Now, you said the microphone was playing up?
,That's right. It wasn't working properly. If something isn't working as it should be, we sometimes say it's playing up.
,Up – not down?
,Nope. Playing down is a different expression that means something totally different.
,OK. So as the picture on my TV at home is flickering, I can say my TV is playing up?
,Exactly. Let's hear about some other things that are playing up.
,I don't think I'll be able to give you a lift to work today, my car's been playing up.
,Oh,my phone keeps playing up. Every time I dial a number, it just switches itself off.
,That sounds like my phone! So if something isn't doing what is should do then it's misbehaving?
,Ha Ha! Well, you could say that. It's just like people. When they misbehave we can say they're playing up. Like this…
,Sorry but I'm going to be late. The children have been playing up and I've still got so much to do.
,BBC Learning English.
,Oh,children are very good at playing up;it's usually because they want attention.
,Now, Helen, could I have your attention now please .
,Because playing up is also something you can say to describe a part of your body that's not working properly.
,Ow! Ow! I'm going to have to lie down; my back's playing up again.
,Count me out of this weekend's football match; my leg's playing up so I need to rest it.
,So it seems playing up refers to anything that's not working or behaving as it should.
,Now Rob, my leg's also been playing up so I wonder if you could give me a lift home in your car?
,No way - oh it looks like my microphone's playing up now!
,No, Rob, it's you who's playing up - now switch it back on!
,Oh, Oh, OK. Then, Helen!
,Let's go then. Bye!
,Bye.
,
,Hi, I'm Neil and this is Helen.
,Hello.
,What's wrong Helen? You're looking rather sheepish.
,Sheepish? Like a sheep? I know my jumper is quite woolly.
,No, I don't mean you look like a sheep. I mean you look sheepish, which is quite different.
,Of course, looking like a sheep and looking sheepish are two totally different things, obviously.
,Yes. If I say you look like a sheep, it means, well, you look like a sheep.
,But if I say you look sheepish, it means you look embarrassed or ashamed about something.
,To look sheepish means you look embarrassed or ashamed, like you've done something wrong or silly?
,Yes.
,Ah, yes.
,Listen to some examples.
,Tom walked into the room looking sheepish.
,Emily grinned sheepishly as she closed the door behind her.
,James gave her a sheepish look.
,So, come on Helen, why are you looking sheepish today?
,Ah, well.
,Yes?
,Well, you know that book you lent me?
,You mean my favourite book of all time, the original edition of The Private lives of the Greatest Cats in History?
,Yes.
,OK Helen, now you're looking very sheepish indeed, so you'd better hurry up and tell me what happened to it.
,I dropped it.
,You dropped it? Well I hope it's not damaged, otherwise I'll have to...
,In the river.
,In the river. You dropped it in the river.
,It was carried away, I couldn't get it out.
,Oh no.
,I'm so sorry. That's why I am looking sheepish.
,You should be looking even more sheepish than that. In fact, I expect you to look sheepish for several days.
,It was the best book in the world! "Sheepish" doesn't do it justice...
,
,Hello. I'm Neil.
,I'm Helen. And Neil is speaking in that rather strange voice because he's in a strange position.
,That's right. I'm bending over backwards, or trying to.
,Bending over backwards. The problem is that you're not very flexible are you?
,No. Even if I bend forwards I can hardly touch my knees, and certainly not my toes.
,Well, look at me!
,Wow, Helen, I had no idea you could do that. You can bend over backwards all the way to the floor!
,Yes. Anyway, maybe we should explain why we're bending over backwards.
,Oh, yes, of course. That's because today's phrase is
,To bend over backwards!
,Listen to these examples and see if you can guess what it means.
,I would bend over backwards for you, just let me know how I can help.
,Julia bent over backwards to make sure everything was right for their visit.
,Did you guess the meaning of 'to bend over backwards'?
,It means to go to great lengths or to put in a lot of effort for someone or something.
,Like "I would bend over backwards to make you happy", Helen.
,Ahhhh. Thank you Neil. Let's hear some more examples.
,I bent over backwards to get Jim what he wanted, but he never thanked me.
,I'll help you a bit, but don't expect me to bend over backwards.
,Oh, ooof.
,Are you okay?
,I need to sit down, I think I've hurt my back.
,Ah, Neil, you must be careful not to bend over backwards too often.
,Yes.
,Or you should just bend over backwards figuratively, but not literally. That's all for now. Bye.
,Bye.
,
,Hi and welcome to The English We Speak. Today we're having an office party with the whole BBC Learning English team.
,And we're eating some delicious cakes and pies that Jen has baked for us. Have you tried the apple tart?
,Mmm, it's so tasty. Jen really has a lot of different skills, doesn't she?
,Yeah, she really gets involved in lots of different activities.
,She's always organising different parties, goes rowing, and did you know she works as a weather presenter at the weekend?
,And she's a good cook too. This blueberry crumble is delicious. She really does have a finger in every pie.
,Ugh, really? I mean they taste good, but now I know she puts her fingers in them. I think I've just lost my appetite.
,That's not what I meant when I said she has a finger in every pie. It means she gets involved in a lot of different things.
,So someone has a finger in every pie when they're involved in different activities? Is it a good thing then?
,Well, in this case, when I said Jen has a finger in every pie, I meant it as a good thing.
,But it can sometimes suggest someone gets involved in things when they shouldn't.
,So it can be a good or a bad thing. Let's have a look at some examples.
,If you need any information just ask Annabel. She has a finger in every pie and always knows the answer.
,At work I'm a teacher but I also do some accounting and organise the end-of-term play. I like to have a finger in every pie.
,I can't seem to do anything without him being there. Yesterday I went to the photography club and he was there.
,Well, unfortunately he does have a finger in every pie.
,So if someone gets involved in too many different things and people disapprove of this, it can be used as a criticism.
,Yes, and Shakespeare used it in his play Henry VIII.
,In the play it's used as a criticism of someone who gets involved in everything when he shouldn't.
,No man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger.
,So the person criticised here feels the need to put his "ambitious finger" in every single pie that's baked to taste them all.
,Yes, which means he gets involved in things he shouldn't.
,But Shakespeare used the expression in a slightly different way from how we use it today.
,Now we just say someone has a finger in every pie.
,Yes, it's slightly less poetic than "no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger".
,Well, this is all very interesting, but I haven't tried the peach pie yet.
,Well, no pie is freed from Helen's greedy fingers, is it? Only joking, Helen.
,
,Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. My name is Callum Robertson.
,And I'm Yang Li.
,Come 'ere then! Oi! Come on then! Want a fight? Who are ya?
,Oh, Callum! Who are all those horrible men that I can hear on my headphones?
,Well, Li, they are yobs.
,Yobs?
,Yes, yobs. Yob is our phrase for today. It's an informal word that refers to a man who is loud and rude and possibly rather violent.
,Oh, that sounds like you!
,What are you talking about, sounds like me? What do you mean? Are you asking for a fight?
,No, no, no! But do you see what I mean? You sound like a yob.
,Hmm, yes, OK. Sorry about that.
,Hmm, anyway, I chose this word because as many people will know the UK recently experienced some violence on the streets of London and other cities.
,'Yob' is a word that the British press used to describe the rioters.
,Let's hear some real headlines from some British newspapers
,UK riots: 11 councils to evict 'riot yobs'.
,Ken Clarke blames 'feral' yobs.
,600 riot yobs left DNA on windows.
,Riot yobs filmed attacking cop cars.
,Riot yobs can't hide.
,UK riots: young yobs back on streets despite David Cameron's pledge.
,Ah, I'm not sure I remember seeing this word yob on the BBC news site.
,Well, no. It's a very negative and judgemental word. The BBC tends to avoid this kind of language in its news stories.
,But this is a piece of British slang that is very common in the UK.
,And we also sometimes use the word yobbo.
,Yobbo. Hmm, but where do all these words come from?
,Well, interestingly, what we have here is an example of backslang.
,If you read the word yob backwards, what do you get?
,Hmm, B.O.Y., boy.
,Exactly. And that's what the word used to mean, but now it refers to a rude and violent man, often a young man but not always.
, Listen Callum, I'm sorry about earlier. I don't really think you are a yob. You are a gentleman.
,Oh, thanks Li.
,But in any case you know if we were to get in a fight I would beat you. So don't you try that again!
,OK.
,
,So, how are you feeling, Vera?
,Oh Thank you for visiting me here in hospital, Rob.
,I feel awful. Oh my leg is broken, my chin is bruised and my pride is hurt. I had a silly fall while I was skiing over the weekend.
,Oh, bad luck, really. But your leg will heal and your bruises will disappear soon, Vera. There will be no sign of them in a few weeks' time.
,Yes, I know Rob. But now I'm in pain. I'm in pain.
,Oh oh but you'll get better, Vera. Just keep your chin up.
,Keep my chin up?
,Keep my chin up might be a new form of treatment. Rob has always been very knowledgeable of these alternative medicines and treatments.
,Perhaps it is good for circulation.
,Is it good for circulation, Rob?
,No Vera, it doesn't help your circulation! Keep your chin up but well, what are you doing? That's not what I mean.
,It's not what you mean?! My chin is up now. Isn't it high enough? Will it help my bruises disappear, Rob?
,Not really. But it will make you feel better, Vera.
,How come, Rob?
,In English, when we tell someone to keep their chin up, we are telling them to stay positive in a tough situation.
,Let's listen to some examples.
,When young people say it is difficult to earn a living nowadays, I tell them to work hard, keep their chin up and they will go places.
,I've just had an argument with my husband. My daughter said she wants to leave school and my cat ran away.
,I feel like crying. Sometimes it's hard to keep my chin up.
,Ah, I've got it. When you want to tell someone to remain positive in a tough situation, you say "keep your chin up" That's a relief, Rob.
,My chin was feeling even more painful than it was before.
,Well, you can relax now. And next time you go to some slope for some skiing make sure you stay on the nursery slopes.
,Nursery? But that's where children do their skiing. That's for kids.
,No, not just for kids, Vera, for beginners too. Anyway, don't be angry. Keep your chin up.
,With a lot of training, one day you'll be a great skier.
,Yes, maybe you are right. If I keep my chin up and train a lot, one day I will be a great skier.
,Good. Well, bye for now.
,Bye.
,
,Hi there Li.
,Oh, hi Chris.
,Are you alright? You seem annoyed?
,Oh, I'm fed up. I had to stay late at work again yesterday.
,I still didn't manage to finish all the work, so I came in early today as well.
,Sounds like you need a cup of tea. I'll put the kettle on.
,What have you got to finish?
,Well, it's not even my work I have to finish. It's Lisa's.
,What do you mean?
,Since she started, she's always asking me to do her work for her.
,She'll start it, and then give it to me to complete, then leave early while I have to stay late to get it all done.
,Oh, I know how you feel. Lisa did the same thing to me last week. She's really difficult to work with.
,Normally I wouldn't give her the time of day, but she is the manager's secretary.
,You wouldn't give her the time of day? What time?
,No, no. It's an expression, a negative expression. What I meant was I wouldn't normally pay attention to her.
,It's a bit of an unfriendly expression to use. Here are some examples.
,After the way Dave talked about me during the meeting, I wouldn't give him the time of day.
,Politicians are all the same. They're never honest. I wouldn't give any of them the time of day.
,Long ago, in Shakespeare's time, the phrase "good time of day" was a greeting often used. These days we say "good morning".
,Or "good afternoon".
,That's right. So to say that you wouldn't give someone the time of day means you wouldn't want to greet them or say hello.
,So the saying means you refuse to give someone your attention.
,Oh, I see.
,But sadly we can't avoid some people in the office, no matter how hard we try.
,Well, I'd better get back to work. I've got so much to do.
,well,good luck. Let me know if you need any help.
,Thanks Chris. See you later.
,
,Rob I don't know why we have to stand up when we present this programme. It's quite tiring.
,Really? But I thought standing up would give us more energy and sitting down makes us a bit lazy.
,But I've been standing up all day, this is my only chance to sit down.
,Why didn't you say. Here, have a chair, take the weight off your feet.
,The weight? Do you mean I'm heavy and my feet can't carry the weight?
,Helen don't be so sensitive. I was being kind. It's a way of saying, relax, sit down, especially after standing up for a long time. ?
,It's got nothing to do with your actual weight.
,Oh I see. To take the weight off your feet. In that case I will.
,OK, and here are some other ways of saying the phrase.
,We've been shopping all day, let's take the weight off our feet, sit down and have a cup of coffee.
,Don't walk to work today, go on the bus and take the weight off your feet.
,Those are different ways of taking the weight off your feet.
,I have to admit Rob, it's very comfortable sitting down. I feel quite relaxed I think I'll put my feet up too.
,Wow, that's another expression we use, to put our feet up.
,Again it means rest and relax and literally, put your feet up on the sofa, or in your case, on the desk.
,Helen you could have taken your shoes off.
,Sorry. To put your feet up Ahh, lovely. Can we hear some more examples please?
,Yes Helen.
,You've been gardening all day, come inside and put your feet up.
,After working for the company for 30 years, Jim has decided it's time to finally put his feet up and retire.
,If he's retiring he'll be putting his feet up for a long time. But Helen we've got work to do, so back on your feet.
,You want me to put the weight on my feet now?
,I'm afraid so. It's time to go shopping.
,Shopping. Why didn't you say.
,Look, I'm back on my feet now.
,That was quick. OK, best foot forward, off to the supermarket we go, left, right, left right.
,Yes, the supermarket Helen. Bye!
,Bye.
,Come on now . Left, right, left right, keep moving those feet.
,
,Hi, I'm Rosie, and this is Li…
,Li? Hurry up. Look, here's the karaoke bar.
,Ahhh. Rosie, why is the bar on the top floor? So many stairs. Help me please. I'm so unfit.
,I need to start doing more exercise. I'm going to join the gym tomorrow.
,Tomorrow? Why don't you join the gym today?
,I'll join it tomorrow and then I'll go every single day. I will. I really will.
,Li, you've been saying that for months but you never actually do it!
,This time I will, I promise.
,That's what you always say. You need to put your money where your mouth is.
,You want me to put my money where my mouth is?
,You want me to eat my coins and banknotes? That's disgusting.
,No, Li, that's not what I meant.
,To put your money where your mouth is means to stop just talking about something and to take action.
,Ah, so you didn't really want me to put all these coins in my mouth?
,No, please don't. I want you to stop talking about joining the gym, and to join it for real.
,Here are some more examples.
,If we played a game of tennis I would easily win.
,Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? I challenge you to a game.

,Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
,When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
,Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
,And it all just sound like uh, uh, uh
,Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize
,That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
,Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance
,Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
,Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.
,My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
,Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
,Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made

,Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
,Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
,To try and apologize for my mistakes
,But I just want you to know
,I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
,Give you all his hours when he has the chance
,Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
,Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

,Took a walk on a Sunday
,to the park where they sing,
,through the market where they peddle
,almost everything.
,Berlin,
,Berlin!
,Then that evening with some friends,
,we spoke fondly of all things,
,laughed much louder than the others
,and our bellies,
,they filled with light!
,Berlin,
,Berlin!
,Oooooh, Berlin!
,Sometimes darkness, it creeps in-
,to my body while I'm sleeping.
,and I watch you fall,
,from the pedestal,
,where you've rested for so long.
,Berlin,
,Berlin!
,Oooooh, Berlin!
,I can remember the good old days
,When you and me we used to hide away
,Where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
,Yea, you fill up my glass
,With promises that could never last
,But I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind
,And all little things that we once said
,Are not in my heart, they're in my head
,That was the time to say goodbye
,Let's put it to rest, let it die
,‘Cause we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
,Yea we've been down that road before
,That was then and this is now
,The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
,Now it just don't feel the same
,I guess it's over, yeah we're done
,I heard you made your way downtown
,To the place that i've been hanging around
,I was looking for your face in the crowd
,But trying to keep my head down
,Over time our wires crossed
,Or you changed it and you got lost
,All the things I would change if we could only rewind
,You were a moment in life that comes and goes
,A riddle, a rhyme that no one knows
,A change of a heart, a twist of fate
,Couldn't fix it, it's too late
,‘Cause we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
,Yea we've been down that road before
,That was then and this is now
,Because in my heart they've been calling out your name
,Now we just don't feel the same
,I guess it's over, yea we're done
,We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
,We don't, we don't need to talk about this now

,Give me a minute of your time.
,And let me explain it and tell you
,why I'm in over my head.
,Now,look in my eyes.I'm afraid,
,I'm loosing my mind again.
,I recall now when they said:
,"Run as fast as you can,girl.He's no good."
,And I stayed 'cause I honestly belive in you and your heart
,Dear,I know it's true
,and I'm losing you.
,'Cause there's much better girls out there.
,And I look back and regret
,how I dropped my heart again
,And I wonder,wonder
,why it's gotta be this way,
,it's always this way.
,And I gave all I got to make you feel special.
,Your kiss,forever on my lips,
,forever on my skin,forever on my mind.
,I'll never fall again like I fell for you.
,My nightmare came true
,This is me swallowing all my pride and my pain.
,And my anger.
,I threw it away.
,'Cause I'm willing to tell you
,what you're gonna miss when I'm gone.
,We would've snuggled on the sofa
,and would've watched Restless;
,I'm not much for bad things
,but for you I'd go all the way.
,And we'd dance to our favorite songs
,Do you remember?
,I'd sleep in your sweater,
,And keep you safe and sound.
,And love every inch of your body.
,And kiss all your scars.
,I'd make you laugh When you were about to get mad.
,Now I know it was wrong
,when I thought I got back in your head.
,And they said:"He doesn't deserve you."“
,And I didn't care again,I didn't mind again
,And I wonder,wonder why it's gotta be this way,
,it's always this way.
,And I gave all I got to be the best you'll ever have.
,Your blue eyes,forever on my mind,
,forever in my head,forever in the past.
,We'll be just strangers with memories.
,Love will find me,I guess.I guess,I guess,I guess.
,And I wonder,wonder why it's gotta be this way,
,it's always this way.
,If I only get you by saying goodbye.
,I don't wanna stay.
,You walked away.
,Wouldn't give it a try.
,You changed your mind.
,It's alright,
,I understand,I do.I understand,
,I do.I understand,I do,
,I wouldn't want me,too
,
,Uh, uh, uh
,Uh, uh, uh
,All you know, all you know is we wanna go far
,Wanna make it, see it take it, we wanna go far
,Somebody shaking the walls now
,Telephone pole down, is that how you call out?
,I feel the touch of your long hair, straight from the cold air
,Is anyone up there?
,You threw me in the sun of light
,And I flew, I’m getting lost in the things I do!
,Maybe there’s a stranger in the room
,Following my heart's and every move
,Maybe there’s a stranger in the room
,Following my heart's and every move
,Starlight, dancers alone in the night
,Fire flies, sparks go by twinkling light
,I hear the stars say, might be the real thing
,See what the moon brings
,The night ends before dawn, heart feels a new call
,Sun brings a new song
,You threw me in the sun of light
,And I flew, I’m getting lost in the things I do

,Following my heart's and its every move

,On the edge, on the edge of everything we know
,It's alright, just don't look down
,And I will hold on
,I'll never let go
,You're right beside me
,So just close your eyes
,I'll never let go, you're all that I need
,So just close your eyes

,Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
,Yeah I believe it
,The past, is everything we were don’t make us who we are
,So I’ll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable

,In, into something big, better than before
,And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
,Then It’s worth fighting for

,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
,And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,So it goes
,He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
,Takes me home
,Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
,I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
,Some other girl
,He says, what you've heard it's true but I
,Can't stop thinking about you and I
,I said I've been there a few times
,Cause You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
,And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time

,Take me home
,Just take me home
,Just take me home
,You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

,No I can't forget this evening
,Or your face as you were leaving
,But I guess that's just the way
,The story goes
,
,You always smile but in your eyes
,You sorrow shows
,Yes it shows
,
,No I can't forget tomorrow
,When I think of all my sorrow
,When I had you there
,But then I let you go
,
,And now it's only fair
,That I should let you know
,What you should know
,I can't live
,If living is without you
,I can't live
,I can't give anymore
,I can't live

,I don't know where I'm at
,I'm standing at the back
,And I'm tired this waiting
,Waiting here in life
,Hoping that I'll find
,What I've been chasing
,
,I shot for the sky
,I'm stuck on the ground
,So why do I try
,I know I'm gonna fall down
,I thought I could fly
,So why did I drown
,Never know why
,It's coming down, down, down
,
,I'm not ready to let go
,'Cause then I'd never know
,What I could be missing
,But I'm missing way too much
,So when do I give up
,What I've been wishing for

,It's coming down, down, down
,
,Oh I'm going down, down, down
,I can't find another way around
,And I don't wanna hear that sound
,Of losing what I never found
,
,I shot for the sky
,I'm stuck on the ground

,We can fight our desires
,But when we start making fires
,We get ever so hot
,Whether we like it or not.
,They say we can love who we trust
,But what is love without lust
,Two hearts with accurate devotions
,What are feelings without emotions.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I hang my hopes out on the line
,Will they be ready for you in time
,If you leave them out too long
,Will they be withered by the sun
,Full stops and exclamation marks
,My words stumble before I start.
,How far can you bend emotion?
,Can this bridge cross the ocean?
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill

,Don’t let go of my hand.

,Talking like a headstrong mamma
,Got a picture in your wallet
,Making me a habit, wearing your vintage t-shirt
,Tied ribbons on your top pad
,Telling me I'm all that, just like the girls from your hometown
,Sweet blooded and up-stranded, see if I can stand it, shrinking in the shallow water
,Magnetic everything about you
,You really got me, now

,Hypnotic taking over me

,Pacific Ocean dug so deep
,Hypnotic taking over me
,White threads on my laces
,Stuck on the hinges, swinging the door to the back yard
,Cut splinters, walk a tightrope
,Spun like a bandage touch on the outer surface
,Bright eyes of the solstice wherever your mind is headed for a freight train city
,Locked up till you're moon lit
,Brushing my hair back, feeling your lips on my cold neck
,Magnetic everything about you

,Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
,I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
,Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
,Bright, so bright

,Don't be afraid to care
,Leave，but don't leave me
,Look around choose your own ground
,For long you live and high you fly
,And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
,And all you touch and all you see
,Is all your life will ever be
,Run rabbit run
,Dig that hole forget the sun
,And when at last the work is done
,Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

,
,Time
,
,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
,You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
,Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
,Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
,Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
,You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
,And then the one day you find ten years have got behind you
,No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
,
,And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
,And racing around to come up behind you again
,The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
,And shorter of breath and one day closer to death
,Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
,Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
,Hanging on in quiet desparation in the English way
,The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
,
,Home, home again
,I like to be here when I can
,When I come home cold and tired
,It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
,Far away, across the field
,The tolling of the iron bell
,Calls the faithful to their knees
,To hear the softly spoken magic spell

,Think I'll buy me a football team
,Money, get back
,I'm all right Jack keep your hands off my stack
,Money, it's a hit
,Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
,I'm in the hi-fidelity first class traveling set
,And I think I need a Lear jet
,
,Money, it's a crime
,Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
,Money, so they say
,Is the root of all evil today
,But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away
,
,Us and Them
,
,Us and Them
,And after all were only ordinary men
,Me and you
,God only knows its not what we would choose to do
,Forward he cried from the rear and the front rank died
,And the General sat and the lines on the map moved from side to side
,Black and Blue
,And who knows which is which and who is who
,Up and Down
,And in the end its only round and round and round
,Havent you heard its a battle of words the poster bearer cried
,Listen son, said the man with the gun theres room for you inside
,
,Down and Out
,It cant be helped but theres a lot of it about
,With, without
,And wholl deny thats what the fightings all about

,I felt persecuted and paralysed
,I thought that everything else would just wait

,Engulfed in a fever of spite

,Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
,Stuck in a world of isolation

,So I open my door to my enemies
,And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
,but they tell me to please go fuck myself

,Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed
,It's annoying
,I just wanna make you feel like
,Everything I ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you
,But, I guess the more you
,Thought about everything, you were never even wrong in the first place, right?
,Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
,Walking towards you with my head down,
,Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
,Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
,That's parents for you
,Very loyal?
,Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife into my hands before
,What else should I carry for you?

,Eventually, I bet that we

,
,We trace my lips
,You raise your touch

,I can't help but wonder
,If our grave was watered by the rain
,Would roses bloom
,Could roses bloom
,They're playing our song
,They're letting us die tonight
,And all of these clouds pulling us back to life
,It's cool as the night
,Six feet under
,I can't help but wonder
,If our grave was watered by the rain
,Uuh uuh uuh
,Uuh uuh uuh
,Again
,Help, I lost myself again
,But I remember you
,Lookin' at the cop in the rear view mirror,
,probably shoulda' stopped but the crosswalk was clear
,I'll just imagine it's a ticket to a Broadway show.
,Lookin' at the clouds and they seem kinda funny,
,probably gonna rain but my outlook is sunny,
,I'll just imagine that I'm layin' out in Mexico.
,'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain,
,and I know that things won't always go my way
,and I know life is gonna suck some days.
,But I can't complain,
,I can't complain
,Every day's too short to let it go to waste.
,And I can't complain,
,I can't complain.
,You gotta treat every day like a holiday.
,And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble,
,and I know the cookie's gonna crumble,
,and I know life is gonna suck some days, but I can't complain.
,Waitin' on a never ending train at the crossing,
,payin' it no mind 'cause you just keep on talkin',
,We'll just imagine it's the good old days and take it slow.
,Spending Christmas eve on the floor at the airport,
,dying to get back to the people that I care for,
,smile and just dream about my puppy in my bed back home.
,'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain,

, You were love of my life
, Ain't I supposed to be with you?
, My angel, my sky
, Was it not enough for you?
,
, So many nights we spent together
, Different point of view was building our love
, Now our feelings are so real like imitation leather
, How will I find myself if you will take my heart away
, Never in life, I know it's the same
, Forget about your promise just let it be this way
, You get this over I've got to run away
, You were love of my life
, Ain't I supposed to be with you?

,Окутала меня, окутала.
,Ты будто мой сорт - мариуанна.
,Небо в алмазах - лето летало.
,Ты моя бэйби - дочь карнавала.
,Двигайся крошка, принцесса бала.
,Ночь перемен - мысли растамана.
,Пока не устал - музыка играла.
,Кто-то курил - кого-то впирало!
,Эта дура дуремара, а нам она.
,Было думал, улетала в теплые края.
,Лето, море, песок, но мне тебя мало.
,Танцую в пол - руки в потолок зала.
,Туда куда пал больше не вернусь.
,Чудом умотал и забрал с ней грусть.
,Это наша жизнь и ей всегда мало.
,Танцую в пол - руки в потолок зала.
,Go everybody shake your ass.
,Go, move everybody мое - любимое шоу.
,Голова качала пощада давала маннама.
,Блавовал планна в налы навара.
,Бутора валом подавай нам!
,Когда будет этот день ты пой про себя.
,Про меня, за любовь, за маму, за брата,
,А то судьба загнет ата - ата!
,А-ТА-МАН... я типа А-ТА-МАН..
,В жарком танго- меломан мною правит bad man.
,Танцуй! Так примитивно! Танцуй! Так импульсивно!
,Танцуй! Дочь карнавала.
,Тут на танцполе тебя было мало.

,Лаврами не взять твой пыл, куралесим.
,Мы на волю по годам сорвемся вместе.
,
,За мгновение облететь планеты ни по чем,
,То барабанит дождь - тоска да печаль.
,Но ты светом добра озарила свободу,
,В танце двигали бёдра.
,Ты моя румба, ты моя самба,
,Ты моя сальса, ты мое танго.
,Дыма навали, Volume наболтай,
,В этих объятиях со мною летай.

,Мы с тобою без гида так надо,
,Тронула душу, твоя мне мила, ламбада.
,Чтобы попой крутила, есть бит, не жаль саба,
,Я горю с тобой как шмаль, в пабах дай жара!
,Готов и я оформить всем вам лойс,
,Кто умеет делать шума (make some noise)
,Жара до утра в угаре толпа,
,Но я смотрю лишь на тебя лишь, веришь ма?
,И когда станет клуб утром клевать носом,
,Я украду тебя будто Азор розу.
,Улыбнусь в тишине и скажу просто
,Иди ко мне, Солнце, расплетай косы.
,Расплетай косы, расплетай косы.
,Иди ко мне, Солнце, расплетай косы.

,I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
,When we loose our winter coats in the spring
,Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
,That every time I see you my heart sings
,Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
,We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
,And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
,Oh I guess we had an expiration date
,So I won't say I love you, it's too late
,And oooooooooh
,Ooooohohoooooh
,And oooohoooooooh
,Ohoooohohohoooooh
,Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
,Shivering and shaking at the knees
,And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
,I didn't know the words in front of me
,In front of me, and oooooooh
,But I don't wanna know
,Who'll take you home?
,Who'll take you home?
,Who'll take you home?
,Hoooooome
,And oooooohhhhh
,And oooooohhhhh
,And oooooohhhhh
,Oooooooohooooohoohhhh
,Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
,The winter winds are colder on my own
,Maybe we will meet when we get older
,So I won't say I love you if you don't
,So I won't say I love you if you don't

,I never saw the signs how I could be so blind

,I think of it all the time
,You were my way of light
,The guide through lonely nights
,You said you were in love
,But I guess I was not enough
,You left me in a shade

,Spelar det längre någon roll
,Jag orkar inte slåss
,Det är bortom min kontroll
,Du lämnade mig ensam
,Och självklart blev jag rädd
,Min sista gnista hopp
,Var att synas att bli sedd
,Och jag glömmer bort att andas
,För sex, musik och våld
,Var det vackraste som hänt mig
,Sen själen min blev såld
,Att synas utan att verka
,Ser enkelt ut på håll
,Men jag lever på impuls nu
,Via fjärrkontroll
,Men jag sa alltid nej
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Och gäst ikväll är Jesus
,Han har kickat heroin
,Han läppjar på sitt glas
,Och Ramlösa blir vin
,Han berättar om sina vapen
,Sin tid i Saint-Tropez
,Om att ge sig själv en chans
,Om sin nya Z-3
,I en värld av Idioter
,Står han först i kön
,Han berättar framför kameran
,Om hur han bytte kön
,Eller nåt helt annat
,Som också är privat
,Om alla dom han älskat
,Och dom han bara sög av

,As long as stars shine down from heaven
,And the rivers run into the sea
,Till the end of time forever
,You’re the only love I’ll need
,In my life you’re all that matters
,In my eyes the only truth I see
,When my hopes and dreams have shattered
,You’re the one that’s there for me
,When I found you I was blessed
,And I will never leave you, I need you
,Imagine me without you
,I’d be lost and so confused
,I wouldn’t last a day, I’d be afraid
,Without you there to see me through
,Imagine me without you
,Lord, you know it’s just impossible
,Because of you, it’s all brand new
,My life is now worthwhile
,I can’t imagine me without you
,When you caught me I was falling
,You’re love lifted me back on my feet
,It was like you heard my calling
,And you rush to set me free
,When I found you I was blessed
,And I will never leave you, I need you
,Imagine me without you
,I’d be lost and so confused

,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I wanna feel your touch
,It's burning me like an ember
,Pretending is not enough
,I wanna feel lost together

,I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
,But it's so cold and I don't know where
,I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
,But they won't flower like they did last spring

,I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me
,
,Papa was a rodeo Mama was a rock'n'roll band
,I could play guitar and rope a steer before I learned to stand
,Home was anywhere with diesel gas - Love was a trucker's hand
,Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand
,
,Before you kiss me you should know
,Papa was a rodeo
,
,What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too
,Even though the world I'm in
,The perfect pitch this way appears
,The greatest pressures of my sin don't disappear
,Although alive and without much
,The wishing, well I wished for you
,Then I look to see myself within it all
,My oceans deep my rivers wide
,The strangers weep at pleasures side
,Oh why do I not see the only one unseen
,I'm lost without it seems so true
,You left from here from me to you
,Well my heart is broken
,I'm trying can't you see, can't you see
,My oceans deep my rivers wide
,The strangers weep at pleasures side
,Oh why do I not see the only one unseen
,My oceans deep my rivers wide
,The strangers weep at pleasures side
,Oh why do I not see the only one unseen
,My oceans deep my rivers wide
,The strangers weep at pleasures side
,Oh why do I not see the only one unseen
,My oceans deep my rivers wide
,The strangers weep at pleasures side
,Oh why do I not see the only one unseen

,I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
,Down Powdermill lane and the Battle grounds
,We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
,I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
,When we talked about things we were gonna do
,We were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too
,We'd go down to the rides on east parade,
,By the lights of the palace arcade
,And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
,I'm begging you for some sign, but you've still got nothing to say
,Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
,I'm a better man now than I was that day.
,Let's go down to the rides on east parade,
,By the lights of the palace arcade
,And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
,Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
,Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
,To take turns as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café
,I wheel my bike off the train,
,Up the North Trade Road.
,And look for you on Marley Lane
,In every building, in every street sign
,Oh, why did we ever go
,So far from home?
,Well, you got nothing to hide, you can't change who you really are,
,You can get a big house and a faster car
,You can run away, boy, but you won't go far.

,I turn the music up I got my records on
,I shut the world outside until the lights come on
,Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
,I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
,And all the kids they dance all the kids dance all night
,Until Monday morning feels another life
,I turn the music up
,I'm on a roll this time
,And heaven is in sight
,I turn the music up I got my records on
,From underneath a rubble I sing a rebel song
,Don't want to see another generation drop
,I'd rather be in a coma than in a full stop
,Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
,Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
,But my heart is beating and my pulses start
,Cathedrals in my heart
,And we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
,To tell me it's alright
,As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
,And every tear's a waterfall
,Is a waterfall Oh
,Is a waterfall Oh
,Is a waterfall
,Every tear is a waterfall
,So you can hurt hurt me bad
,But I'll still raise the flag
,Oh
,It was a wa wa wa wa waterfall

,I lift my lips from kissing you
,To kiss the sky
,Cloud soft and blue
,And slow the sun melts down
,Into your golden words for me
,
,I lift my hands from touching you
,To touch the wind that whispers through
,This twilight garden
,Turns into a world
,Where dreams are real
,
,No-one will ever take your place
,I am lost in you
,No-one will ever take your place
,So in love with you

,oh they say people come, they say people go.
,This particular diamond was extra special
,And though you might be gone
,And the world may not know
,Still I see you, celestial
,Like a lion you ran
,A Goddess you rolled
,Like an eagle you circled
,In perfect purple
,So how come things move on?
,How come cars don’t slow?
,When it feels like the end of my world?
,When I should but I can’t let you go?
,But when I’m cold, cold
,Oh when I’m cold, cold
,There’s a light that you give me
,When I’m in shadows
,There’s a feeling you give me, an everglow
,Like brothers in blood
,Sisters who ride
,And we swore on that night
,We'd be friends 'til we died
,But the changing of winds
,And the way waters flow
,Life as short as the falling of snow
,And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
,But when I'm cold, cold
,In water rolled, salt
,I know that you’re with me
,And the way you will show
,And you’re with me wherever I go
,And you give me this feeling this everglow
,Oh, what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
,Yeah, I live for this feeling this everglow
,So if you love someone, you should let them know
,Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

,Olan oldu, esini kaybettin,
,Esini kaybetti benzerin.
,Günaydin, mösyö günaydin,
,Biliyorum hala buradasin,
,Karanlik odada asilmayi bekleyen,
,Fotograf kadar inatçisin.
,Agirima gidiyor, saygisizca gidisin,

,Fairy tales can come true
,It can happen to you if you're young at heart
,For it's hard, you will find
,To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart
,You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
,You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
,And life gets more exciting with each passing day
,And love is either in your heart or on it's way
,Don't you know that it's worth
,Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
,For as rich as you are
,It's much better by far to be young at heart
,And if you should survive to a hundred and five
,Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
,And here is the best part, you have a head start
,If you are among the very young at heart

,Smooth and seductive who's really got a plan
,It's drawing me in, magnetically to you

,This is my winter song to you
,The storm is coming soon
,It rolls in from the sea
,My voice: a beacon in the night
,My words will be your light to carry you to me
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?
,Is love alive?

,They say that things just cannot grow
,Beneath the winter snow

,And life will find a way
,I'll be your harvester of light
,And send it out tonight
,So we can start again

,My woman brought children for me
,So I can sing them all my songs
,And I can tell them stories
,Most of my boys are with me

,And some I had to leave behind
,My brother, I'm still sorry
,
,Soon I'll be sixty years old,
,my daddy got sixty-one
,Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
,I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
,I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

,Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?

,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
,Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
,You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
,Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
,Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
,If you want the things you love, you must have showers
,So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
,There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
,Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
,Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven

,Den svenska drömmen, jag var 17 år
,En vanlig kille blev en ny idol
,O en natt förändra' allt
,All denna kärlek, alla hårda slag
,Är sånt som aldrig kommer bli normalt
,Jag försöker hålla mig kvar
,Men det e lätt att jag fastnar
,Fastnar i bilder som inte är jag
,Ljuset på, för alla ögon ser på mig
,Vandrar åren ut som än en akt för dig
,Det är ensamt hemma fast än alla kan mitt namn
,Livet som jag valt kan va så jävla kallt ibland
,Som i en film som alla tittar på
,De följer med men från ett annat håll
,Hur jag känner vet ingen annan om
,Jag var produkten som blev kött o blod
,Vägen dit var värd den tid det tog
,Att kämpa för att få växa upp
,Men det e lätt att jag fastnar
,Fastnar i bilder som inte är jag
,Ljuset på, för alla ögon ser på mig
,Vandrar åren ut som än en akt för dig
,Det är ensamt hemma fast än alla kan mitt namn
,Livet som jag valt kan va så jävla kallt ibland

,I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
,We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
,We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
,But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
,Kristen, come right back
,I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
,When you light the candle
,And on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
,And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
,Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
,Think I like you best when you're just with me
,And no one else...
,Kristen, come right back
,I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
,When you light the candle
,And I'm kissing you lying in my room
,Holding you until you fall asleep
,And it's just as good as I knew it would be
,Stay with me I don't want you to leave...
,Kristen, come right back
,I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
,When you light the candle?

,I'll wear the blues away
,I will wait for you
,I will see you through

,We can pretend
,I don’t wanna be
,Alone anymore
,Somewhere you’ll find
,Awake in my mind
,Frozen in time
,A way back home
,There’s a silence in this place
,I can hear the sound it makes
,Don’t control my heart now
,We need to be apart
,I cannot be in the dark again
,With you
,Feel the air around you
,Let it all surround you
,Back on solid ground again

, And I watch it burn
, And somewhere deep inside, I know there's a lesson to be learned
, It's not the crime but the way that we pay for
, Feelings are mutual
,
, And you go upstairs
, And I hang my head
, Somebody said I let myself down as I crawled into bed
, I wondered why the hell I'd ever paid for
, Feelings are mutual
,
, I'm tired of living in the shadow
, These paper walls, I can't break through
, I'm sick of standing by your window
, Tracing silhouettes of you
, But when it gets dark
, You light the spark
, And all the lies I try to live by start falling apart
, Whoever knew it could be so painful
, Feelings unmutual
, Now I can't escape
, These things I've done
, But my anxieties have promised me the worst is to come
, So give up living for the life that you paid for
, Feelings are mutual
, I've won

,As the starlight strikes a pose over rows of council homes
,The chemical times, chemicals tie beautiful lives beautiful lies
,Smileaholics jump into screens, where everyone's happy it seems
,Feeling empowered in powders of dreams, consciously floating downstream
,Don't ever cry, don't ever cry
,From the everlasting shame to the park bench with your name
,The chemical times, chemicals tie beautiful lives, beautiful lies
,Seen an island in the Sun to a breeze they breathe as one
,The chemical times, chemicals tie beautiful lives, beautiful lies
,Fading faces fade to one in the Earth and sky and Sun
,The chemical times, chemicals tie beautiful lives, beautiful lies
,Seen an island in the Sun to a breeze they breathe as one
,Incredible times, the chemical times, beautiful lives, beautiful lies
,It was a day like today
,A Sunday afternoon when they took you away
,Down to Hades in a shopping trolley
,With a magazine and a suitcase
,They stole your clothes
,I took your watch
,I couldn't look you in the eye
,Why is it always those who you love the most, you criticise, saying
,Oh no stranger, you're just like me,
,These things happen, we were children in the mid-90's
,Saying, oh no stranger, you're just like me,
,We get older, they get younger, it was you or me
,We stood there throwing ice cream in your hair
,How I solemly swear
,It's the thing in life I regret the most
,Leaving you standing there
,And if you asked me I'd put my eyes out
,And when I woke up blind
,If you forgave me I would sleep at night
,Knowing I'd led a good life
,Oh no stranger, you're just like me,
,These things happen, we were children in the mid-90's
,Saying, oh no stranger, you're just like me,
,We get older, they get younger, it was you or me
,Learnin' how to keep living
,Oh no stranger, you're just like me,

,Slip inside the eye of your mind
,Don't you know you might find
,A better place to play
,You said that you'd never been
,But all the things that you've seen
,Can't fade away
,So I'll start the revolution from my bed
,Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
,Step outside the summertime's in bloom
,Stand up beside the fireplace
,Take that look from off your face
,You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
,So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
,My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say
,Take me to the place where you go
,Where nobody knows if it's night or day
,Please don't put your life in the hands
,Of my Rock n Roll band
,Who'll throw it all away
,I'll gonna start the revolution from my bed

,You left, I died,
,I went and you cried
,You came, I think
,But I never really know
,I've served my time
,I've watched you climb
,The wrong incline
,But what do I know
,Accept it, Don't let it
,Turn the screw
,Accept it, And let it
,Scream back at you
,Now this applies both equally to you and I
,The only thing we share
,Is the same sky
,These empty metaphors，They're all in vain
,Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains
,In the garden Snake was a charmin'
,And Eve said let's give it a try
,Now lead us not into temptation
,But no matter how hard I try
,When in the garden and
,Snake is a charmin'
,And Eve says let's give it a try
,Eve is the apple of my eye

I don't know how to 
Love only her
She looks at me through an
Magnifying hourglass
I can't seem to hold faith 
With all the candy in here
I just seem to want
Only things i can't have
I always want you near
I always want you near me
Blessed with your whips of mercy
Speech stained of white glass
You sound as though you been lost 
Or tired of playing games
I'll just try and see it your way
But i can't help feeling low

,Breaking through the night

,Burning your eyes
,Such a sweet surprise
,
,Just breathe in the air
,Take in the day
,Put on a smile
,Be one with the way

,Looking at the skies
,Don't need to ask why
,I have my answers
,Not a afraid to die

,And in the end we will transform, we will transcend
,We'll fly away, we'll fly away, we'll fly away

,And now I am standing here

,They don't always happen when you ask
,And it's easy to give in to your fear

,Can't see you way safe through the rain
,Thought of a still resilient voice
,Says love is very near

,Just one last dance....oh baby...just one last dance
,We meet in the night in the Spanish café
,I look in your eyes just don't know what to say
,It feels like I'm drowning in salty water
,A few hours left 'til the sun's gonna rise
,tomorrow will come an it's time to realize
,our love has finished forever
,how I wish to come with you (wish to come with you)
,how I wish we make it through
,Just one last dance
,before we say goodbye
,when we sway and turn round and round and round
,it's like the first time
,Just one more chance
,hold me tight and keep me warm
,cause the night is getting cold
,and I don't know where I belong
,Just one last dance
,The wine and the lights and the Spanish guitar
,I'll never forget how romantic they are
,but I know, tomorrow I'll lose the one I love
,There's no way to come with you
,it's the only thing to do
,Just one last dance
,before we say goodbye
,when we sway and turn round and round and round
,it's like the first time
,Just one more chance
,hold me tight and keep me warm
,cause the night is getting cold
,and I don't know where I belong
,Just one last dance
,Oh,Baby
,Just one last dance
,before we say goodbye

,Baby won't you tell me why there is sadness in your eyes
,I don't wanna say goodbye to you
,Love is one big illusion I should try to forget
,but there is something left in my head
,You're the one who set it up now you're the one to make it stop
,I'm the one who's feeling lost right now
,Now you want me to forget every little thing you said
,but there is something left in my head
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long
,But I'm not the man your heart is missing
,That's why you go away I know
,You were never satisfied no matter how I tried
,Now you wanna say goodbye to me
,Love is one big illusion I should try to forget
,but there is something left in my head
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long
,But I'm not the man your heart is missing
,That's why you go away I know
,Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere
,Don't know which way to go
,There ain't so much to say now between us
,There ain't so much for you
,There ain't so much for me anymore
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long
,But I'm not the man your heart is missing
,That's why you go away I know
,That's why you go away I know

,When i was young i'd listen to the radio
,waiting for my favorite songs
,When they played i'd sing along,
,it made me smile.
,Those were such happy times and not so long ago
,how i wondered where they'd gone.
,But they're back again just like a long lost friend
,all the songs i love so well.
,Every shalala every wo'wo
,still shines.
,Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
,that they're starting
,to sing so fine
,When they get to the part
,Where he's breaking her heart
,It can really make me cry
,just like before.
,It's yesterday once more.
,(shoobie do lang lang)
,Looking back on how it was in years gone by
,and the good times that I had
,makes today seem rather sad,
,so much has changed.
,It was songs of love that i would sing to them
,and i'd memorise each word.
,Those old melodies still sound so good to me
,as they melt the years away
,every shalala every wo'wo still shines
,every shing-a-ling-a-ling
,that they're startingto sing
,so fine
,all my best memorise come back clearly to me
,Some can even make me cry
,just like before.
,It's yesterday once more.

,I'da never thought that you would have my back

,Threw some punches then we had a laugh

,Hanging tough through thick and thin
,Kicking up dust wherever we go
,I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
,Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?

,Never change - J. Han
,
,Our love for each other was so pure.
,I looked out for you, you reached out to me.
,We would never be separated by simple aberration,
,
,Cause of regular collaborations.
,
,Yes, our times together were so sweet
,And on the weekends we would have our meetings.
,You were seeking my attention,
,You called me every single day for conversation.
,
,You were confident even when the problems hit.
,Obstacles and potholes were challenges.
,You trusted me amidst your disarray.
,I hoped you stayed to hear what I had to say.
,My encouragement was your strength to carry on,
,Even though you relied on Dom Perignon.
,You wanted a higher love, I provided.
,You are my bride, why did you fight it?
,Chorus: **You wanna be together with me for eternity?
,
,You turn your head the other way and choose to feed your greed.
,You are my masterpiece, I have washed your feet.
,My love for you will never change, I will never change.
,
,No matter what the world says about you.
,Truth will always stand and itll bear fruit.
,Sometimes youre embarrassed of me
,And yet so arrogant to your peers like pharisees.
,Heresy floats on the surface.
,Instead of building on my rock, you decide to throw them.
,You would greet me with a cloaked passion
,But lacked the compassion, you actor.
,You act up, attracted to blasphe- me, myself, and I mentality.
,The fallacy in that you aint really worthy
,Youre not the master says Luke 17.
,I married you, Ive tasted the tea you brewed
,If you aint hot for me, then youre dispensable.
,I dont care how sweet you were.
,Today make sure you pick up your cross and follow my word.
,You wanna be together with me for eternity?
,
,You turn your head the other way and choose to feed your greed.
,You are my masterpiece, I have washed your feet.
,My love for you will never change, I will never change.
,
,Youre holding out for something big to happen
,All you really need are my arms to be wrapped in
,You know that, but you refuse to admit that
,I am the only one that youre lackin
,What happened to the passion?
,Youre lazy Letting all the stupid things drive you crazy
,I told you, I am everything youre ever gonna need
,So please let go of it all,
,You see the pain that I felt for you then?
,The gift you received with your every single amen?
,Its been a few days, months, or years
,Since the last time I took away your fears, your tears
,I miss youwell did you know that?
,I paid the price so you never gotta look back
,All I want is to love and be loved in return.
,
,You wanna be together with me for eternity?
,
,You turn your head the other way and choose to feed your greed.
,You are my masterpiece, I have washed your feet.
,My love for you will never change, I will never change.
,
,You wanna be together with me for eternity?

,Once I was seven years old my momma told me
,Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
,Once I was seven years old
,It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
,Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
,By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
,Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
,Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
,Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
,Once I was eleven years old
,I always had that dream like my daddy before me
,So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
,Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
,Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
,Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
,Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
,Once I was 20 years old
,Lukas Graham!!!
,I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
,Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
,I got my boys with me at least those in favor
,And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
,Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
,I was writing about everything, I saw before me
,Once I was 20 years old
,Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
,We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
,Soon we'll be 30 years old
,I'm still learning about life
,My woman brought children for me
,So I can sing them all my songs
,And I can tell them stories
,Most of my boys are with me
,Some are still out seeking glory
,And some I had to leave behind
,My brother I'm still sorry
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
,Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
,I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
,I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
,Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
,Soon I'll be 60 years old

,Oh,if you could see me now now~~
,It was February 14th,
,Valentines Day
,The roses came,but they took you away
,Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm
,All the harm,gotta keep myself calm
,But the truth is you're gone
,And I'll never get to show you these songs
,Dad,you should see the tours that I'm on
,I see you standing there next to mom
,Both singing along,yeah arm in arm
,There are days when I'm losing my faith
,Because the man wasn't good -he was great!
,He'd say,"Music was the home for your pain"
,And explain I was young,he would say
,"Take that rage,put it on a page,
,Take the page to the stage,blow the roof off the place."
,I'm tryin'to make you proud,do everything you did
,I hope you're up there with God sayin'"That's my kid"
,I still look for your face in the crowd
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Yeah
,Oh,if you could see me now
,If you could see me know would you recognize me
,Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
,Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
,Put your hand on the heart that was cold as the day you were taken away
,I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
,Right now,I wish he could hear you say,
,I drink too much and I smoke too much Dutch
,But if you can't see me now that sh*t's a must.
,He used to say I won't know 'til it cost me
,Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it
,So if you've lost a sister,someone's lost a mom
,And if you've lost a dad,then someone's lost a son
,And they're all missing now,and they're all missing now
,So if you get a second to look down at me now
,Mom,dad,I'm just missin'you now
,I still look for your face in the crowd
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,
,Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
,Would you love me,loser or winner?
,Oh
,When I see my face in the mirror
,We look so alike that it makes me shiver
,Oh
,I still look for your face in the crowd
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Oh,if you could see me now
,Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
,Oh,if you could see me now

,Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
,Now it looks as though they're here to stay
,Oh, I believe in yesterday.
,Suddenly,I'm not half the man I used to be,
,There's a shadow hanging over me.
,Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
,Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
,I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
,Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
,Now I need a place to hide away.

,There are places I'll remember
,All my life though some have changed
,Some forever not for better
,Some have gone and some remain
,All these places have their moments
,With lovers and friends I still can recall
,Some are dead and some are living
,In my life I've loved them all
,But of all these friends and lovers
,There is no one compares with you
,And these memories lose their meaning
,When I think of love as something new
,Though I know I'll never lose affection
,For people and things that went before
,I know I'll often stop and think about them
,In my life I love you more
,Though I know I'll never lose affection
,For people and things that went before

,With every mistake we must surely be learning

,Having read a book, I'd like to turn you on...

,Found my coat and grabbed my head,

,Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
,Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
,I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
,I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
,I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
,I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
,I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
,And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
,And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
,Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
,Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
,I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
,I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
,I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
,I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
,I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
,I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
,I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
,And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
,And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
,And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
,And what did you hear, my darling young one?
,I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
,Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
,Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
,Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
,Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
,Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
,Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
,And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
,And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
,Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
,Who did you meet, my darling young one?
,I met a young child beside a dead pony,
,I met a white man who walked a black dog,
,I met a young woman whose body was burning,
,I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
,I met one man who was wounded in love,
,I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
,And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
,It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
,Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
,Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
,I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
,I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
,Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
,Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
,Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
,Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
,Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
,Where black is the color, where none is the number,
,And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
,And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,
,Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
,But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
,It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

,I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
,I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
,She said i never seen a man who looks so all alone
,Could you use a little company
,If you pay the right price
,Your evening will be nice
,Or you can go and send me on my way
,I said your such a sweet young thing
,Why'd you do this to yourself
,She looked at me and this is what she said
,There ain't no rest for the wicked
,Money don't grow on trees
,I got bills to pay
,I got mouths to feed
,There ain't nothing in this world for free
,I know i can't slow down
,I can't hold back though you know i wish i could
,Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
,Until we close our eyes for good
,Not even 15 minutes later after walking down the street
,When i saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight
,And then he swept up from behind
,Put a gun up to my head
,He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
,He said give me all you've got
,I want your money not your life
,But if you try to make a move i won't think twice
,I told him you can have my cash
,But first you know i've got to ask
,What made you want to live this kind of life
,He said
,There ain't no rest for the wicked
,Money don't grow on trees
,I got bills to pay
,I got mouths to feed
,There ain't nothing in this world for free
,I know i can't slow down
,I can't hold back though you know i wish i could
,Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
,Until we close our eyes for good
,
,And now a couple hours past
,And i was sitting in my house
,The day was winding down and coming to an end
,So i turned on the TV
,And flipped it over to the news
,And what i saw i almost couldn't comprehend
,I saw a preacher man in cuffs taking money from the church
,He stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
,But even still i can't say much cause i know were all the same
,Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
,You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
,Money don't grow on trees
,We got bills to pay
,We got mouths to feed
,There ain't nothing in this world for free
,I know we can't slow down
,We can't hold back though you know we wish we could
,Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
,Until we close our eyes for good.

,When we were in our youth
,We had dreams that we could fly

,Helped me take down
,Are only getting taller now
,And I've even forgotten how
,To stand on my two feet
,I wanna say 'I'm on my own'
,And happier to be alone
,But everything I do alone
,Has every bit of you

Living on a farm road
Takin' all your time slow
Cheerin' from the bleachers
Don't you wish your life was gold?
I bet you do
Passing out your lighter
Sneakin' through the doorway
Fakin' like you just stayed home
That's how it really goes
You know it does
I don't think that we're bad
I don't think we're bad at all
It just takes some time alone
Hey Hey Girl
We're the wild type
But we've been around the block one too many times tonight
Fucked up at the disco
Slipping in the K-Hole
Sleeping in the parks, no fun
They we need an education, lack imagination
Holding out for something dumb
Kickin' for the third time
And now we're done
Bread and butter
Cryin' on the subway
Waitin' on a cold day
Don't react, here he comes
I don't think we're bad
I don't think we're bad at all
It just takes some time alone
Hey Hey girl, we're the wild type
But we've been around the block once too many times tonight
(x2)
I know that it's easy
That it's easier said than done
I know that It's easy
That it's easier said than done
Hey hey girl, we're the wild type...(x2)
,She lives in a fairy tale
,Somewhere too far for us to find
,Forgotten the taste and smell
,Of the world that she's left behind
,It's all about the exposure the lens I told her

,Because your real life is tragic

,If it's not real
,You can't hold it in your hand
,You can't feel it with your heart
,And I won't believe it
,But if it's true
,You can see it with your eyes
,Or even in the dark

Well, maybe we should stop this (I wish we never started)
Oh maybe we should go

Oh, so it's a long way down in New York City
And I fell so fast, it wasn't pretty
It's a long way down, but I wanna go
Oh, 'cause I'm a symptomatic automatic city really misses at
But I don't really care that much 'cause I know where my head is at
Well, oh, now I'm a symptomatic automatic city really dizzy track
Oh, tell me do you like that? (I don't think I like that)
Well, maybe we should stop this (I wish we never started)

There are secrets buried inside
That you ought to know
That you need to know
Just another time that we don't share
It's an hour long, but we don't care
Just another town we're passing through
It's of no concern to me and you

Do you really want to know what I think
Do you really want me to show what I know
Buried deep inside
You ought to know you need to know

,Parachute - The Mess I Made
,
,
,Should've kissed you there
,I should've held your face
,I should've watched those eyes
,Instead of run in place
,I should've called you out
,I should've said your name
,I should've turned around
,I should've looked again
,
,But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made
,I'm staring at the mess I made
,I'm staring at the mess I made
,As you turn, you take your heart and walk away
,
,Should've held my ground
,I could've been redeemed
,For every second chance
,That changed its mind on me
,I should've spoken up
,I should've proudly claimed
,That oh my head's to blame
,For my hearts mistakes
,
,But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made
,I'm staring at the mess I made
,I'm staring at the mess I made
,As you turn, you take your heart and walk away
,
,And it's you
,And it's you
,And it's you
,And it's you
,
,And it's falling down
,As you walk away

,
,
,Oh my heart's been beating sad
,Can't help thinking about
,Times that we've had.
,Pictures on wall to minds that fall
,It's hard knowing some people
,Don't care at all
,But Happiness will come our way
,And magic comes just not today
,When ships are sailing across the sea
,The lights are on, inside we never see
,So here's to the day, the dying day
,I'll carry on drinking but
,I'll find another way
,And how we soared when
,times are good
,Seems to look these days
,the moon is never full
,But Happiness will come our way
,And magic comes just not today
,When ships are sailing across the sea
,The lights are on, inside we never see
,How long to go? I don't know,
,I don't know.
,You'll look in her eyes
,And you'll know and you'll know
,How long to go? I don't know,
,I don't know
,You'll look in her eyes
,But Happiness will come our way
,And magic comes just not today
,When ships are sailing across the sea
,The lights are on, inside we never see
,I was on the water when it began to heave
,And at the fight my words were strong
,But I would not have the magic that they stop making patterns
,It caps of white, raised and broke I fasten to the boat
,
,The panic overtook me and the fear I held within
,I drew a breath and I tried to find the courage
,To stand the troubled trip. What have I gotten myself into?
,I silently wondered, I silently asked
,
,I thought of my family and thought of my love
,I thought of my maker and what might be above
,And the cabin in the woods that I have not yet build
,Many other things that I hold dear in this world
,
,I rode through the turmoil and rode through the strife
,I held to my words and I clumped to my life
,And then when my vision began to blur
,This is what I saw in the thought that had occur
,
,I saw every fish swimming fast beside me
,And all kinds of leafs from all different trees
,And all of the insects that circle on the earth
,Birds and land animals are reaching towards birth
,
,And I saw my body on a body of water
,And I could see that we were the same
,Roaring and reckless, invulnerable
,Emotion and swinging and predisposed to changing
,
,When I open my eyes vision respell
,I picked up my words and I kissed the condense
,With stronger arms I silently swear
,I silently drifted, I silently wept
,Kiss me out of the bearded barley
,Nightly, beside the green, green grass
,Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
,I wear those shoes and You will wear that dress.
,
,Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
,Lead me out on the moonlit floor
,Lift your open hand
,Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
,Silver moon's sparkling
,So kiss me
,
,Kiss me down by the broken tree house
,Swing me upon its hanging tire
,Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
,We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
,
,Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
,Lead me out on the moonlit floor
,Lift your open hand
,Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
,Silver moon's sparkling
,So kiss me
,

,You’ve cried too much lately
,Don’t you think you’ve had enough

,Doesn’t seem God sent
,You’re waiting but the times get tough
,Open up your eyes and say all your goodbyes
,As you walk outside the door to leave
,No, you never looked back
,Never took a real chance
,You just locked the door and took the key
,You can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun

,Turn the radio on

,Till’ you you get to where you need
,I know your baby’s left
,But it’s really for the best
,It’s not the future that you wanted to see
,But maybe some day soon
,She’ll be back in this room
,And finally be the woman she outta be
,She can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun
,Hop in your car
,Turn the radio on

,I've heard there was a secret chord
,That David played and it pleased the Lord
,But you don't really care for music, do you?
,It goes like this...the fourth, the fifth
,The minor fall
,The major lift
,The baffled King composing Hallelujah
,Hallelujah
,Hallelujah
,Hallelujah
,Hallelujah
,Your faith was strong but you needed proof
,You saw her bathing on the roof
,Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
,She tied you to a kitchen chair
,She broke your throne
,She cut your hair
,And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
,Maybe I have been here before
,I know this room, I've walked this floor
,I used to live alone before I knew you
,I've seen your flag on the marble arch
,Love is not a victory march
,It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
,There was a time you let me know
,What's real and going on below
,But now you never show it to me, do you?
,And remember when I moved in you
,The holy dark was moving too
,And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
,Maybe there's a God above
,And all I ever learned from love
,Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
,And it's not a cry you can hear at night
,It's not somebody who's seen the light
,It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Let’s not go back
I ain’t got a knack
for provoking an attack
but exposing what I lack

Back in those days
I had set the stage
for elaborate disgrace
in a neverlasting haze(? – haste)

But for once I took a wrong turn
which turned out to be a right
I bet you didn’t see that one coming from me
But infact I’m not that unhappy
with being the bull’s eye in the sea
I guess I was just a bit tired of drifting aimlessly

So dressed in remorse
I prepared for war
But you know I still miss you kid
in spite of what I did

That’s not just where, they say, all is fair
Something I thought I was above, that is if I still believed in love

So I’m going to leave before your questions
Drill a hole in the ground
Where we can powernap, wrapped in bubble wrap
Just too awake with the discovery
she came along to neither you nor me
That’s not the way that she’s placing her loyalties

To me that’s fine
I have drawn the line
Here in the centrefold of time
Not looking forward nor behind

Besides it’s clear once you’ve kept them near
The world is obviously loaned(?) because people seem to think they own it

So let’s just celebrate our downfall
I mean, while we’re down in the hall
Until we finally meet the kid in the middle seat
While she’s engaged to the concrete
We’ve got our words and these frozen streets
We’ll keep on niggling(?) fervently on Bob Dylan’s feet
,For you I want to sing a happier song
,For you I’m gonna try to right all my wrongs
,For you I’m gonna break my bad habits
,There’s a golden ring and I want you to have it
,There’s a golden ring and I want you
,
,For you I’m gonna sit and patiently wait
,It’s great if you’re early but if it’s fine if you’re late
,For you I feel love and I just want to show it
,You’re a beautiful girl and I want you to know it
,You’re a beautiful girl and I want you to know it
,You’re a beautiful girl and I want you to know it
,It’s an infinite world and I want you
,
,Once again I am opened
,Once again I am opened
,For you I’m waiting on the ticket line
,I gotta get back I don’t wanna waste time
,But the people are tired and the line is so long
,So all I can do is sing this song
,
No one in their right mind is ever gonna trust you again
Too many like you have already come and went
Having trouble making good choices
You're haunted by nightmares, guided by voices
Devil on your shoulder wishes you'd told her
That you wouldn't wait till you were older
It's all out of hand, just beyond your command and they don't understand
When you're one
When you're one so young
Drivin' around your forgettable town
You turn up the music, lost in the sound
Tryin' your best to move through the night
And walkin' the line of darkness and light
Cop's in your rearview, he's comin' too close
And you try to stay calm with your heart in your throat
As he moves up beside you and on down the road
You just want to explode
When you're one
When you're one so young
One so young
One so young
And no one sees just who you will be
When you're one so young
No one in their right mind is ever gonna trust you again
Too many like you have already come and went
Having trouble making good choices
You're haunted by nightmares, guided by voices
Devil on your shoulder wishes you'd told her
That you wouldn't wait till you were older
It's all out of hand, just beyond your command and they don't understand
When you're one
When you're one so young
One so young
One so young
And no one sees just who you will be
When you're one so young

,Sure I know you like to have me
,Talk about my future
,And a million words or so to fill you
,in about my past
,
,Have I sisters or a brother
,When's my birthday how my mother
,Well my dear in time I'll answer all
,those things you ask
,
,But for now I'll just say I love you
,Nothing more seems important somehow
,And tomorrow can wait come whatever
,Let me love you forever but right now
,Right now
,
,Some fine day when we go walking
,Weâll take time for idle talking
,Sharing every feeling as we
,watch each other smile
,
,I'll hold your hand you'll hold my hand
,We'll say things we never had planned
,Then we'll get to know each other
,in a little while
,
,But for now let me say I love you
,Later on there'll be time for so much more
,But for now meaning now and forever
,Let me kiss you my darling then once more
,Once more
,
,But for now let me say I love you
,Later on I must know much more of you
,But for now here and now how I love you
,As you are in my arms I love you
,I love you
,I love you
,
,Hold up your arms
,I don't see you
,Let tide return
,
,Your tired limbs
,Sea and battered
,I look for you
,
,I will pull you from water
,Let your lungs return to air
,Take you back unto the shore
,And  lead you home
,
,This ravaged mind
,A thousand voices
,They call for you
,
,Draw near my hand
,The swelling water
,Your rest will come

,i think i ought to do it again
,...
,whenever i was mad at my brother
,because he was better than me
,i used to go tell our mother
,that he was bein mean to me
,...
,but i would never do that again
,it's not the way to treat a brother friend
,
,i would never do that again
,...
,cause i just locked the door and pulled the chain
,flushed my evil spirits down the drain
,all my inner demons drift away
,...
,as time goes on i know
,the garbage will afloat
,but i just keep on goin
,though i should take it slow
,...
,i had better do it again

,oh i never meant to scare you karen
,you're my girlfriend
,i think i ought to flush myself down the toilet again
,You're my art star
,You're my love star
,You take care of me when I'm feeling sick
,You're a desert road to safe water
,You're my childhood dreams all in one
,You're a death train
,You're a car wreck
,You're a willow tree in my garden
,When I look at you, I see summer
,I will never leave you alone
,
,You're a fawn
,You're a silo
,You're my father's hands when it's cold outside
,
,When I just think of you
,Everything burns and disappears from my eyes
,
,When I just think of
,You
,When I just think of
,You
,When I just think of
,You
,When I just think of
,You
,
,I will never
,I won't ever
,I won't ever
,Leave you
,I remember when you said
,You were full of sparks in your head
,Your words were fireworks in me
,I saw my firework in you
,I thought your skin was like a veil
,Concealing hope and fairytales
,And your hands were like a map
,From where many' ll find their way back
,At least I did
,Through fire
,Through water
,Through death do us, death do us part
,Through fire
,Through water
,Through death do us, death do us part
,You showed me where the swans would nest
,You let the silence do the rest
,And in that room of pearly white
,I saw your darkness and your light
,So when you get lost
,Then I can find the architecture of your mind
,In quiet buildings you belong
,And I' ll be there to sing this song:
," Through fire
,Through water
,Through death do us, death do us part
,Through rainbows
,Through rainfall
,Through floodstreams of tears
,Through failure
,Through absence
,Through presence of human time
,Through everything
,With love
,With love
,Through fire
,Through water
,Through death do us, death do us part. "
Out of breath, out of time
Heaven knows I've lost my mind
Asking everyone I find
But that don't change a thing
And I tell 'em where I went
Down to somewhere near the river
Could've sworn I'd seen her
Maybe a day ago
Oh no, looking to find some answers
I gotta take some chances
I just have to know
If heaven sent me an angel
I gotta find a place where
I can see her again
Oh no, lest my eyes deceive me
Oh, do you believe me?
I just have to know
What's a man to do
But go looking after you?
Oh, they call me a fool
But that don't change a thing
And I tell 'em where I went
Down to somewhere near the river
Could've sworn I'd seen her
Maybe a day ago
Oh no, looking to find some answers
I gotta take some chances
I just have to know
If heaven sent me an angel
I gotta find a place where
I can see her again
Oh no, lest my eyes deceive me
Oh, do you believe me?
I just have to know
Down to somewhere near the river
Could've sworn I'd seen her

,
,oh night
,We are the waiting and the stolen
,we are the foreigners the wandering
,we are the ghost upon the road, and
,we are just listening to the pale night
,on the way to God
,bones and all
,until the weight is gone
,oh night
,we are the citizens of nowhere
,we are the guests in our own homes here
,we are the listeners the lonesome
,we are the weariest waters
,where the waves lie broken now
,bones and all
,until the weight is gone
,
,Follow you down to the red oak tree
,As the air moves thick through the hollow reeds
,Will you wait for me there until someone comes
,To carry me, carry me down
,See I have not, I have not grown cold
,I have stole from men who have stole from those
,With their arms so thin and their skin so old
,But you are young, you are young, you are young
,Then somebody laughs like it's all just for hell
,As though we could not be saved from the depth of the well
,But the cloth that I make is a cloth you can sell
,To pay for the gossamer seed, ooh, ooh, oh
,Names get carved in the red oak tree
,Of the ones who stay and the ones who leave
,I will wait for you there with these cindered bones
,So follow me, follow me down
,Follow me, follow me down
,Follow me, follow me down
,Follow me, follow me down
,Another head hangs lowly
,Child is slowly taken
,And the violence caused such silence
,Who are we mistaken
,But You see it's not me,
,It s not my family
,In your head,in your head
,They are fighting
,With their tanks, and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are crying
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,Another mother's breaking
,Heart is taking over
,When the violence causes silence
,We must be mistaken
,It's the same old theme since 1916
,In your head,
,In your head they're still fighting
,With their tanks ,and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are dying
,In your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,Bad day, looking for a way
,Oh, looking for the great escape
,Gets in his car and drives away
,Far from all the things that we are
,Puts on a smile and breaths it in and breaths it out
,He says bye-bye, bye to all of the noise
,Oh he says bye-bye bye to all of the noise
,Hey child, things are looking down,
,That's OK you don't need to win anyways
,Don't be afraid just eat up all the gray
,and it will fade away
,Don't let yourself fall down
,Bad day, looking for the great escape
,He says bad day, looking for the great escape
,On a bad day, looking for the great escape
,Great escape
,I was young when I set out
,I can hardly remember
,Oh the tales that I could tell you
,If I only could remember
,And the fog it is drumming
,And the new world is coming
,Oh this song I will be humming
,When the words wont come out
,On a slow boat to China
,I will be, I will be
,In the sea, when we get there
,We will see what will be
,On a slow boat to China
,I will be, I will be
,We will see when we get there
,What will be
,Now I’m old I am weathered
,my beard is long and white
,I have seen many crawling winters
,on this sleepy ark
,still we go for our fathers
,and we go for the lost
,still we go ever on
,into the common dark
,On a slow boat to China
,I will be, I will be
,In the sea, when we get there
,We will see what will be
,On a slow boat to China

,the love you drink it all of full
,and the trees white and drunk
,and strip down of their clothes
,and i realize i am not sure
,what you look like anymore
,but every cell says i remember you well
,but it's been so long since i saw you laugh out loud
,and if i could , i ply our boat, snow it tonight

,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue
,I see the life I never had before
,Do you remember when
,We used to live things separate
,We hadn't met or thought
,That could be possible
,I'm glad you had your life
,So good to listen to your past
,All of those things brought you
,With me and now we're two
,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue
,I see the life I never had before
,You always talk so smooth
,And in your voice, so true
,I hear the dream
,I never had before
,But if I try to think Of something better than this
,Heaven comes down
,And reminds the luck we live
,You're always such a fool
,And in your eyes so blue
,I see the life I never had before
,You always talk so smooth
,And in your voice, so true
,I hear the dream
,I never had before
,I’ve been scared of silence since you flew
,baby we were fools without a clue
,reaching for the things we never knew
,searching every beat that wasn’t true
,
,the saddest thing i’ve ever had to do
,was finally accepting that our love was through
,fearing every thought that leads to you
,slowly sinking deep into the blue
,baby -  hush now please don’t ever let me know
,baby hush now don’t you ever let it show
,
,cause though it may not be a wound now it is still an awful scar
,cause after all’s been said and done i still don’t know just who you are
,but i will throw away the feathers and i’ll cast aside the tar
,cause though it may not last forever it’s a dream that’s gone too far
,my little star my little star my little star
,my little star my little star my little star...
,
,How long will I love you?
,As long as stars are above you
,And longer if I can
,How long will I need you?
,As long as the seasons need to follow their plan
,How long will I be with you?
,As long as the sea is bound to wash upon the sand
,How long will I want you?
,As long as you want me to
,And longer by far
,How long will I hold you?
,As long as your father told you
,As long as you can
,How long will I give to you?
,As long as I live through you
,However long you say
,How long will I love you?
,As long as stars are above you
,And longer if I may
,How long will I love you?
,As long as stars are above you

,Anything that i could say right now
,Would only be a pale reflection of what I feel
,Won’t you let me just look at you
,Our eyes are the windows to
,Our souls, and they will show
,One another all there is to know
,About the things that I’d like you to uderstand
,Hold my hand and listen with your skin
,Let your inner senses take me in, and
,We will go beyond words
,Like a wish that’s remained consealed
,Like a wound that has never healed
,In the secret language of the heart
,I summoned you to me as the missing part
,Of my life’s design
,Your destiny’s linked with mine
,Look at the stars- it’s written there
,That you and I were meant to share
,A sense of belonging that
,We will not find elsewhere
,I’ll say a prayer
,As I light these candles for you
,An offering to your unspoken wish coming true
,but
,The present is the gift
,Yeah, this right here
,This right here, this right here

,No one lying through their teeth

,Everybody loves the things you do
,From the way you talk
,To the way you move
,Everybody here is watching you
,Cause you feel like home?
,You're like a dream come true
,But if by chance you're here alone
,Can I have a moment
,Before I go?
,Cause I've been by myself all night long
,Hoping you're someone I used to know?
,You look like a movie
,You sound like a song
,My God, this reminds me
,Of when we were young
,Let me photograph you in this light
,In case it is the last time
,That we might be exactly like we were
,Before we realized
,We were sad of getting old
,It made us restless
,It was just like a movie
,It was just like a song
,I was so scared to face my fears
,Nobody told me that you'd be here
,And I swear you moved overseas
,That's what you said
,When you left me
,You still look like a movie
,You still sound like a song
,My God, this reminds me
,Of when we were young

,It's hard to admit that
,Everything just takes me back
,To when you were there
,To when you were there
,And a part of me keeps holding on
,Just in case it hasn't gone
,I guess I still care
,Do you still care?

,
,
,When my heart is ready to burst,
,When the world spins in reverse
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you go, turn down the light
,No one's here to hold you in the night
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home!
,When our picture fades in the SUN
,And all the colors blur in the one
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home!
,When your all gets blinded
,When you fold with the cards
,No, I'll never stop fighting
,To get to where you are!
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,When the lights are faded to black
,Only stars are guiding me back
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home
,To the kid in the corner
,Trapped in the shadows of doubt.
,Passing time till it's over
,Just hoping one day you'll be found.
,Tell me who threw your chance away?
,Did they even know your name?
,If you live in the echo
,your heart never beats as loud.
,you're not invisible.
,you're not alone
,you worth more than they know.
,but you've been running running running.
,when you should have known.
,you're not forgettable.
,forgettable.

,I've seen a feel of rejection inside your eyes
,whisper of truth, lost in the quiet night.
,I know it's more than you can bare
,It may seem like no one cares.
,when your world is the darkest
,remember the sun will rise.
,you're not invisible.
,you're not alone
,you worth more than they know.
,but you've been running running running.
,but you should have known.
,you're not forgettable.

,you're not forgettable
,you're not replaceable.
,but you're perfect they way you (are)

,I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
,Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
,staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
,I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
,Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
,Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
,You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
,Running into the dark underground
,All the subways around create a great sound
,To my motion fatigue: farewell
,With your ear to a seashell
,You can hear the waves in underwater caves
,As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
,
,Time together is just never quite enough
,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
,We need time, only time
,When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
,If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
,So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
,All the time, all the time
,Can you believe that the crew has gone
,and wouldn't let me sign on?
,All my islands have sunk in the deep,
,so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
,I feel as if I were home some nights
,when we count all the ship lights
,I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
,We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
,~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~

,
,
,Sittin' here, breathing deeply, fucking ready to go
,Been standing here blankly for an hour, can't say goodbye or hello
,It's like solitary confinement, just need someone to hold
,I'm not as brave as I'm portrayed, I need to be told to be bold
,Comin' in hot, I'm alone, no support
,Packed my bags, said hello to the airport
,I hope they board up my room and keep it empty
,Because fillin' my space ain't that damn easy
,My frontier awaits, I'm a soldier trecking solo
,Leaving all the past shit down below
,Movin' out, I've grown from a seed to a tree
,Gunna miss my friends and my family
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Grabbing ahold of my memories, tucking away them away in my pocket
,I'll be the holder of the key to heart shaped locket
,Now I know the pain remains but you gotta know I'm gunna return
,I'm like a dog run away from my home but there's a trail that's been burned for me to follow
,Back to you, to your arms, to your heart, to your soul
,I'll be bleeding from the inside out through your empty hole
,I'm scared as hell, to go out on my own
,You can wait by the door, by the window, until the day I come home
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,Bridge
,I've got my ticket to click it
,Stick it out to the end
,Start the engine, leave my vengeance outside on the landing pad
,I've got my ticket to click it
,Stick it out to the end
,Start the engine, leave my vengeance, got a new life to begin
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain
,Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane
,I've got nothing left to say
,No matter how far I go, I will never leave you
,I've got to show that I can flow like a pro in a different state and home
,Keep your feet on your track
,I'll keep my mind in line with the time
,And we'll be happy, living together and free in the blink of an eye
,I'm as content as I've ever been
,Not trippin' or slippin'
,I've been livin' life to the fullest, it's love I've been grippin'
,It's so strong I could leave for years and come back
,And nothing will have changed, except I'll be on your track
,
,I'm not a stranger to the dark
,Hide away they say
,'Cause we don't want your broken parts
,I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
,Run away they say
,No one will love you as you are
,But I won't let them break me down to dust

,But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
,I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
,Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
,Before the politics that we call the rap game
,And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
,And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
,But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
,So can I get a wish to end the politics
,And get back to the music that started this shit
,So here I stand and then again I say
,I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes
,Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
,I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
,Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars

,Another weekend, oh
,I was with my friends that is true
,But you were sneaking, oh
,You forgot you said you'd drive me home
,So took a taxi home
,Cold and alone and in the dark on my own
,So we're not speaking, no
,Read between the silence on the phone
,I'm not the kind of girl that would go fucking you off
,But you're the kind of guy that get's nothing when taking it off
,You'll be acting like you don't know what you did that was wrong
,So I hope you pay attention when I'm singing this song
,Lines, oh oh oh, there's a thing called lines, oh oh oh
,And I said don't care, but maybe I might
,Baby there's a thing called lines
,Oh oh oh, but yours aren't white, oh oh oh
,I wrote your sorry soul, and I crossed them out
,A thing called lines, oh oh oh, lines, oh oh oh
,Lines, oh oh oh, there's a thing called lines
,My girl was swiping, through
,Funny how she came across you
,So she swiped right on, you
,Didn't think you'd swipe right too
,I've had about enough
,Losing trust and there's nothing left to do
,You put an X on us, and you've got a lot to undo
,I'm not the kind of girl that would go fucking you off
,But you're the kind of guy that get's nothing when taking it off
,You'll be acting like you don't know what you did that was wrong
,So I hope you pay attention when I'm singing this song
,Lines, oh oh oh, there's a thing called lines, oh oh oh
,And I said don't care, but maybe I might
,Baby there's a thing called lines
,Oh oh oh, but yours aren't white, oh oh oh
,I wrote your sorry soul, and I crossed them out
,A thing called lines, oh oh oh, lines, oh oh oh
,Lines, oh oh oh, there's a thing called lines
,So this is it, your final strike
,I've given you chances, you're a lucky guy
,Love is pure, as cure as seen
,Neither of us are perfect, but you're just being mean
,So cross my heart, and made to die
,Stick a needle, in my eye
,If only once, if only twice
,But one more time, and you've crossed the
,Line, oh oh oh, there's a thing called lines, oh oh oh
,And I said don't care, but maybe I might
,Baby there's a thing called lines
,Oh oh oh, but yours aren't white, oh oh oh
,I wrote your sorry soul, and I crossed them out

,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
,You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
,Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
,Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
,
,Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
,You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
,And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
,No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
,
,And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
,And racing around to come up behind you again
,The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
,Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
,
,Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
,Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
,Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
,The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
,
,Home, home again
,I like to be here when I can
,And when I come home cold and tired
,It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
,Far away across the field
,The tolling of the iron bell
,Calls the faithful to their knees
,To hear the softly spoken magic spells.
,It's not the world that's out of order
,It's me, it's me
,Guess I ran along my borders
,Just to see, just to see
,
,If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me
,But I lost my faith as I lost my way
,
,It's not the street that's made of concrete
,It's you, it's you
,Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view
,I had never taken more than I give to you
,I was led astray and I lost my way
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,It's not the light that casts the shadow
,It's doubt, it's doubt
,As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about
,
,I had never fought as hard though as I do for you
,I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong
,
,Never felt so alone
,Stripped naked and cold to the bone
,Lost my faith being high on my own
,With no queue by the door to my home
,
,And god sent an angel
,An angel
,She's an angel
,An angel...

,Where
,were you
,when I was burned and broken
,While the days slipped by
,from my window watching
,Where
,were you
,when I was hurt and I was helpless
,Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
,While you were hanging yourself on someone else`s words
,Dying to believe in what you heard
,I was staring straight into the shining sun
,Lost in thought
,and lost in time
,While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
,Outside the rain
,fell dark and slow
,While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
,I took a heavenly ride through our silence
,I knew the moment had arrived
,For killing the past and coming back to life
,I took a heavenly ride through our silence
,I knew the waiting had began
,And headed straight ......
,into the shining sun

,Heaven is closer now today
,The sound is in my ears
,I can't believe the things you say
,They echo what I fear
,Twisting the bones until they snap
,I scream but no one knows
,You say I'm familiar, cold to touch
,And then you turn and go
,Feels like heaven
,Feels like heaven
,See how we planned for saddened eyes
,And tears to pave the way
,I fought the fever as I knew
,My hair returned to gray
,Study your face and fade the frame
,Too close for comfort now
,We can recall the harmony
,That lingered but turned sour
,Feels like heaven
,Feels like heaven
,You wanted all I had to give
,See me, I feel, see me, I live

,and I know life is gonna suck some days,
,but I can't complain.

,Every night in my dreams
,I see you
,I feel you
,That is how I know you go on
,Far across the distance
,And spaces between us.
,You have come to show you go on
,Near far,
,wherever you are
,I believe that the heart does go on
,Once more,
,you open the door,
,And you've been in my heart,
,And my heart will go on and on
,Love can touch us one time.
,And last for a lifetime
,And never let go till we're gone,
,Love was when I loved you
,One true time I hold to.
,In my life we'll always go on.
,Near far,
,wherever you are
,I believe that the heart does go on
,Once more,
,you open the door,
,And you've been in my heart,
,And my heart will go on and on
,You're here,
,there's nothing I fear.
,And I know that my heart will go on
,we'll stay forever this way.
,You are safe in my heart,
,and my heart will go on and on
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name

,
,in the year of our lord 1239
,there once lived a girl of a royal line
,the ancient stories do recall ?
,she was the fairest of them all
,in a castle made of stone
,every night she slept alone
,any noise that would raise the dead
,couldn't wake her sleepyhead
,a stranger came from a foreign land
,asking for the maiden's hand
,her father said no go away
,she's gonna marry a king one day
,the stranger he came back again
,riding with 10 thousand men
,Their battle cries filled all with dread
,but couldn't wake her sleepyhead
,the fighting lasted all day long
,but the castle walls were thick and strong
,the stranger cried let her decide
,where her true affections lie
,so the king knocked on her door
,only you can end this war
,no one knows how the story ends
,did she ever wake again?
,will she ever wake again?
,I've been reading books of old
,The legends and the myths
,Achilles and his gold
,Hercules and his gifts
,Spiderman's control
,And Batman with his fists
,And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
,But she said, where'd you wanna go?
,How much you wanna risk?
,I'm not looking for somebody
,With some superhuman gifts
,Some superhero
,Some fairytale bliss
,Just something I can turn to
,Somebody I can kiss
,I want something just like this
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
,Oh I want something just like this
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
,Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
,Oh I want something just like this
,I want something just like this
,I've been reading books of old
,The legends and the myths
,The testaments they told
,The moon and its eclipse
,And Superman unrolls
,A suit before he lifts
,But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
,She said, where'd you wanna go?
,How much you wanna risk?
,I'm not looking for somebody
,With some superhuman gifts
,Some superhero
,Some fairytale bliss
,Just something I can turn to

,
,I saw the light fade from the sky
,On the wind I heard a sigh
,As the snowflakes cover my fallen brothers
,I will say this last goodbye
,
,Night is now falling
,So ends this day
,The road is now calling
,And I must away
,Over hill and under tree
,Through lands where never light has shone
,By silver streams that run down to the Sea
,
,Under cloud, beneath the stars
,Over snow one winters morn
,I turn at last to paths that lead home
,And though where the road then takes me
,I cannot tell
,We came all this way
,But now comes the day
,To bid you farewell
,
,Many places I have been
,Many sorrows I have seen
,But I don't regret
,Nor will I forget
,All who took the road with me.

,There's a port on a western bay
,And it serves a hundred ships a day
,Lonely sailors pass the time away
,And talk about their homes
,And there's a girl in this harbor town
,And she works layin' whiskey down
,They say "Brandy  fetch another round"
,She serves them whiskey and wine
,The sailors say
,"Brandy  you're a fine girl"
,"What a good wife you would be"
,"Yeah your eyes could steal
,A sailor from the sea"
,Brandy wears a braided chain
,Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
,A locket that bears the name
,Of the man that Brandy loves
,He came on a summer's day
,Bringin' gifts from far away
,But he made it clear he couldn't stay
,No harbor was his home
,The sailor said
,"Brandy  you're a fine girl"
,"What a good wife you would be"
,"But my life  my lover
,My lady is the sea"
,Yeah  Brandy used to watch his eyes
,When he told his sailor stories
,She could feel the ocean fall and rise
,She saw its ragin' glory
,But he had always told the truth
,Lord  he was an honest man
,And Brandy does her best to understand
,At night when the bars close down
,Brandy walks through a silent town
,And loves a man who's not around
,She still can hear him say
,She hears him say
,"Brandy  you're a fine girl"
,"What a good wife you would be"
,"But my life  my lover  my lady is the sea"
,She hears him say
,"Brandy  you're a fine girl"
,"What a good wife you would be"
,It's not time to make a change
,Just relax take it easy
,You're still young that's your fault
,There's so much you have to know
,Find a girl settle down
,If you want you can marry
,Look at me I am old
,But I'm happy
,I was once like you are now
,And I know that it's not easy
,To become when you've found
,Something going on
,But take your time think a lot
,Think of everything you've got
,For you will still be here tomorrow
,But your dreams may not
,How can I try to explain
,When I do it turns away again
,And it's always been the same
,Same old story
,From the moment I could talk
,I was ordered to listen
,Now there's a way and I know
,That I have to go away
,I know I have to go
,It's not time to make a change
,Just sit down
,And take it slowly
,You're still young that's your fault
,There's so much you have to go through
,Find a girl settle down
,If you want you can marry
,Look at me I am old
,But I'm happy
,All the times that I've cried
,Keeping all the things I knew inside
,And it's hard
,But it's harder to ignore it
,If they were right I'd agree
,But it's them they know not me
,Now there's a way and I know
,That I have to go away
,I know I have to go

,On a dark desert highway,
,cool wind in my hair
,Warm smell of colitas,
,rising up through the air
,Up ahead in the distance,
,I saw a shimmering light
,My head grew heavy and
,my sight grew dim
,I had to stop for the night
,There she stood in the doorway;
,I heard the mission bell
,And I was thinking to myself,
,'This could be Heaven or
,this could be Hell'
,Then she lit up a candle
,and she showed me the way
,There were voices down the corridor,
,I thought I heard them say...
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely face
,Such a lovely face
,Plenty of room at the Hotel California
,Any time of year, you can find it here
,Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,
,she got the Mercedes bends
,She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
,that she calls friends
,How they dance in the courtyard,
,sweet summer sweat.
,Some dance to remember,
,some dance to forget
,So I called up the Captain,
,'Please bring me my wine'
,He said,'We haven't had
,that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
,And still those voices are calling
,from far away,
,Wake you up in the middle of the night
,Just to hear them say...
,Welcome to the Hotel California
,Such a lovely place
,Such a lovely face
,Such a lovely face
,They livin' it up at the Hotel California
,What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
,Mirrors on the ceiling,
,The pink champagne on ice
,And she said 'We are all
,just prisoners here, of our own device'
,And in the master's chambers,
,They gathered for the feast
,The stab it with their steely knives,
,But they just can't kill the beast
,Last thing I remember, I was
,Running for the door
,I had to find the passage back
,To the place I was before
,'Relax,'said the night man,
,We are programmed to receive.
,You can checkout any time you like,
,but you can never leave
,Nice to meet you
,Where you've been?
,I can show you incredible things
,Magic, madness, heaven, sins
,Saw you there and I thought oh my god
,Look at that face, you look like my next mistake
,Love's a game, wanna play
,New money, suit and tie
,I can read you like a magazine
,Ain't it funny rumors fly
,And I know you've heard about me
,So hey, let's be friends
,And I am dying to see how this one ends
,Grab your passport and my hand
,I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
,So it's gonna be forever
,Or it's gonna go down in flames
,You can tell me when it's over
,If the high was worth the pain
,Got a long list of ex-lovers
,They'll tell you I'm insane
,Cause you know I love the players
,And you love the game
,Cause we're young and we're reckless
,We'll take this way too far,
,It'll leave you breathless
,Or with a nasty scar
,Got a long list of ex-lovers
,They'll tell you I'm insane
,But I got a blank space baby
,And I'll write your name
,Cherry lips
,Crystal skies
,I could show you incredible things
,Stolen kisses, pretty lies
,You're the king baby I'm your queen
,Find out what you want
,Be that girl for a month
,But the worst is yet to come
,Oh no
,Screaming, crying, perfect storms
,I could make all the tables turn
,Rose garden filled with thorns
,Keep you second guessing like oh my god
,Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy
,But you'll come back each time you leave
,Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
,So it's gonna be forever
,Or it's gonna go down in flames

,每一次
,偷偷的看你
,太阳晒过你白色的衬衣
,听海浪 安静而动听
,有间奏在我心里缓缓弹钢琴
,我们有找不到原因又奇妙的默契
,你眼里也有同样藏不住的孩子气
,转几千公里才走到目的地
,旅程多美丽 因为你在这里
,这是不是爱情
,像一场旧电影
,微笑或沉默都是美好的事情
,你是不是爱情
,或只是陪着我旅行
,同看过这一路风景
,这一路 我走走停停
,谁都带着回忆一起远行
,坐慢车 倒退看风景
,原来下错了站才能遇见你
,我们有找不到原因又奇妙的默契
,你眼里也有同样藏不住的孩子气
,转几千公里才到这目的地
,沿路的美丽 都是因为你
,这是不是爱情
,像一场旧电影
,微笑或沉默都是美好的事情
,你是不是爱情
,或只是陪着我旅行
,同看过这一路风景
,云朵在眨眼
,空气很香甜
,我们走很远
,忘记了时间
,你在我身边
,只好让全世界
,陪我一起流连
,这是不是爱情
,像一场旧电影
,微笑或沉默都是美好的事情
,你是不是爱情
,或只是陪着我旅行
,至少我没错过风景
,你看着我眼睛
,牵着我的手等天明
,告诉我这就是爱情

,He deals the cards as a meditation
,And those he plays never suspect
,He doesn't play for the money he wins
,He doesn't play for respect
,He deals the cards to find the answer
,The sacred geometery of chance
,The hidden law of a probable outcome
,The numbers lead a dance
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart
,He may play the jack of diamonds
,He may lay the queen of spades
,He may conseal a king in his hand
,While the memory of it fades
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that the diamonds mean money for this art
,But that's not the shape of my heart

,And if i told you that i loved you
,You'd maybe think there's something wrong
,I'm not a man of too many faces
,The mask i wear is one
,Those who speak know nothing
,And find out to their cost
,Like those who curse their luck in too many places
,Are those who fear a lost
,I know that the spades are swords of a soldier
,I know that the clubs are weapons of war
,I know that diamonds mean money for this art

,Running from the morning
,Think I hit a wall
,Late nights, not you
,Running from the moment
,So I don’t recall
,Late nights, not you
,Waking up in a cold sweat
,Someone else in this cold bed
,I’d do anything to not be alone
,All alone with the ceiling
,All alone with this feeling
,And I wonder if I’ll ever let go
,I tried spending my nights under
,Someone new
,But the truth is
,I could spend my whole life getting over you
,Yeah yeah yeah
,Getting over you
,Getting over you
,Getting over you
,Getting over you
,Getting over you
,Getting over you
,Drowning in my coffee
,To wash the alcohol
,Out my bloodstream
,Sitting here I wonder
,If we hadn’t been at all
,Who would I be
,Waking up in a cold sweat
,Someone else in this cold bed
,And I wonder if I’ll ever let go
,I tried spending
,My nights under
,Someone new
,But the truth is
,I could spend my whole life getting over you
,Yeah yeah yeah

, All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
, We could go anywhere we could do
, Anything girl whatever the mood we're in
, All I know is (ooh ooh ooh)
, Getting lost late at night under stars
, Finding love standing right where we are your lips
, They pull me in the moment
, You and I alone and
, People may be watching I don't mind ‘cause
, Anywhere with you feels right
, Anywhere with you feels like
, Paris in the rain
, Paris in the rain
, We don't need a fancy town
, Or bottles that we can't pronounce
, Cause anywhere babe
, Is like Paris in the rain
, When I’m with you
, When I’m with you
, Paris in the rain
, Paris in the rain
, I look at you now and I want this forever
, I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
, Don't know how I ever did it all without you
, My heart is about to about to jump out of my chest
, Feelings they come and they go that they do
, Feelings they come and they go not with you
, The late nights
, And the street lights
, And the people
, Look at me girl
, And the whole world could stop

, All I do is miss you
, Come and set the mood right
, Underneath the moonlight
, (Days in Paris
, Nights in Paris)
, Paint you with my eyes closed
, Wonder where the time goes
, (Yeah, Isn't it obvious
, Isn't it obvious)
, Come and set the mood right
, Underneath the moonlight
, Anywhere with you feel right
, Anywhere with you feels like
, Paris in the rain
, Paris in the rain
, Walking down an empty street
, Puddles underneath our feet
, I g-g-give you every reason,
, You t-t-told me give it time,
, It seems that we always have hours never arrive
, I c-c-cry you seven oceans
, b-b-but my tears couldn't make you see
, I finally realise I'm not for you
, And you're not for me
, I'm in love with somebody new
, Look in my eyes and you'll know it's true
, I'm in love with somebody new
, D-d-don't keep leaving messages
, T-t-telling me you've changed
, 'cus nothing you can say could make me turn back and rearrange
, I'm in love with somebody new
, Look in my eyes and you'll know it's true
, I'm in love with somebody new
, Something inside that I can't ignore
, I could try to explain but I'd hurt you more
, I'm in love with somebody, love with somebody new
, Woah Oh...
, I'm in love with somebody new
, Look in my eyes and you'll know it's true
, I'm in love with somebody, love with somebody new

,Sunday morning, rain is falling
,Steal some covers, share some skin
,Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
,You twist to fit the mold that I am in
,But things just get so crazy
,Living life gets hard to do
,And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
,That someday it would lead me back to you
,That someday it would lead me back to you
,That may be all I need
,In darkness she is all I see
,Come and rest your bones with me
,In darkness she is all I see
,Come and rest your
,In darkness she is all I see
,Come and rest your bones with me
,In darkness she is all
,And I never want to leave
,Fingers trace your every outline oh yeah
,Paint a picture with my hands
,And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
,Change the weather still together when it ends
,That may be all I need
,In darkness she is all I see
,Come and rest your bones with me
,In darkness she is all I see
,Come and rest your bones with me

,American investigators this week examined wreckage from the Asiana Airlines passenger jet that crashed last Saturday at San Francisco airport.
,Officials say two kinds of equipment, the autopilot and auto-throttle, did not appear to have failed.
,American and South Korean officials are working together on the investigation.
,Asiana is Korea's second largest airline after Korean Air.
,Asiana Flight 214 was carrying more than 300 people from Seoul to the United States.
,They included 141 Chinese, 77 Koreans and 61 Americans.
,Two passengers died after the crash.
,More than 180 people were taken to California hospitals for treatment.
,They were injured when the airplane, a Boeing 777, crash-landed.
,Information from the plane's flight data recorder shows that the aircraft was traveling too slowly as it came in for a landing.
,The landing gear struck a seawall at the end of the airport runway, causing the tail end of the plane to break off.
,Investigators are also attempting to understand events that led to a 90 second delay in the order for everyone to leave the airplane.
,The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Deborah Hersman, met with reporters Thursday in San Francisco.
,She said her investigators had questioned six of the 12 flight attendants.
,The other six remained hospitalized.
,Ms. Hersman said investigators would talk with all the flight crew members as they try to learn about the performance of the plane's safety equipment.
,Two flight crew members were injured when emergency escape equipment inflated inside the airplane.
,The equipment is supposed to open up outside the plane so passengers can slide to the ground.
,The air safety official said the manufacturer of the device had offered to cooperate in the investigation.
,At an earlier press conference, the NTSB chairwoman said the pilot at the controls was only about halfway through his training on the Boeing 777.
,But the head of Asiana Airlines rejected suggestions that the pilot and his co-pilot trainer lacked experience.
,Speaking at his company's headquarters in Seoul, Asiana Airlines president Yoon Young-doo defended the pilots' training.
,American lawmakers are pressing for enactment of new pilot training rules in the United States and around the world.
,Senator Charles Schumer is from New York, where a 2009 plane crash killed 49 people.
,"There is no reason that American passengers should be put at risk by poorly trained pilots in other countries."
,Earlier this week, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye sent a letter of regret to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the Asiana Airlines crash.
,She also expressed sympathy to the families of two Chinese students who died.
,The two 16-year-old girls were the only deaths.
,They were found outside the plane, which caught fire as it slid down the runway.
,Investigators say one of the victims may have been struck by an emergency vehicle.
,Some survivors of the crash have criticized the lack of emergency medical transport.
,Fire trucks arrived within a minute of the crash but ambulances were delayed in reaching all the injured.

,Americans continue to react to the decision
,in the murder trial of George Zimmerman.
,Last week, a jury in the southern state of Florida
,found that he was not guilty
,in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
,The unarmed teenager was killed last year
,in a struggle with the defendant.
,At the time, George Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer
,in his community in Florida.
,Trayvon Martin, an African American,
,was walking to the home of his father's girlfriend
,at the time of the killing.
,George Zimmerman is a white Hispanic man.
,He called police to report Trayvon Martin
,as a suspicious person in the neighborhood.
,He followed the teenager, although police told him not to.
,The two fought.
,Mr. Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense
,after he was attacked by the young man.
,Under Florida law, people can use deadly force to fight back
,if they feel their lives are in danger.
,Soon after the six woman jury reached its decision on Saturday,
,people used social media and public protests
,to express their opinion about the verdict.
,"No justice. No peace. Trayvon! Justice for Trayvon!"
,Many protests have been held across the United States since the trial.
,Hundreds of people demonstrated in Chicago, Illinois.
,They expressed opposition to what activist Dickey Gaines says
,was a predetermined verdict -- one reached before the trial.
,"Because there was a lot of people across this country
,that was in favor of George Zimmerman being acquitted
,by virtue of them donating money to his defense,
,so that was a clear indication early on people
,was in support of him being acquitted in this case."
,Casey David Cole Senior was one such supporter.
,He spoke to reporters near the Sanford, Florida courthouse,
,where the trial took place.
,"I'm here to express my opinion.
,I believe that George Zimmerman is an innocent man."
,For Chicago protester Bryan Burroughs,
,the case is clear in his mind.
,"Trayvon Martin was guilty of nothing
,but being black in a mostly white neighborhood."
,Activist Dickey Gaines says the ruling has not changed his belief
,that George Zimmerman targeted the teenager because he was black.
,"He focused on Trayvon because of Trayvon's skin color."
,Hans von Spakovsky works for the Heritage Foundation
,research group here in Washington.
,He says the legal action against Mr. Zimmerman should end now.
,"If the Justice Department continues to pursue this case when,
,one, he's been found innocent and,
,two, we know there's no racial animus
,which is necessary for a civil rights violation,
,that once again makes it look like politics
,is driving the prosecution, not justice."
,Racial inequality in the United States goes back centuries.
,The issue of slavery was a major reason
,for the nation's civil war in the 1860s.
,But discrimination continued after black slaves were freed.
,And racial tensions still exist.
,Greg Carr is chairman of Afro-American Studies at Howard University,
,a historically black college here in Washington.
,"One thing that's tangible that can come out of this verdict
,is a renewed commitment to addressing people,
,and not looking to the courts -- not looking to the law
,to somehow regulate or change people's hearts and minds."
,Mr. Carr warns that if a civil rights case
,were brought against George Zimmerman and lost,
,it would increase the distrust of many people.
,But if such a case were won, he says,
,Americans would look to the courts,
,not within themselves, for racial healing.

,An Egyptian judge this week
,ordered the continued detention of
,ousted President Mohamed Morsi.
,The official MENA news agency says
,Mr. Morsi has been detained for 15 days
,for investigation of suspected links
,to the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
,He is accused of working with Hamas
,to attack police stations two years ago
,during the rebellion that ousted
,then-president Hosni Mubarak.
,Mr. Morsi has been held without charge
,since July 3rd,
,when he was removed by Egypt's military.
,The court order came as his supporters
,and opponents held competing protests on Friday.
,Many Egyptians have been killed in political violence
,in recent weeks.
,On Wednesday, the United States announced it was delaying
,a planned shipment of four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt.
,Defense Department spokesman George Little noted
,what he called the "fluid situation" in the country.
,"Given the current situation in Egypt,
,we do not believe it is appropriate to move forward
,at this time with the delivery of F-16s."
,Some American lawmakers have been calling
,for a suspension of American aid to Egypt.
,The calls began after the removal of Mr. Morsi,
,who was the country's first democratically elected president.
,The United States provides $1.3 billion
,in military aid to Egypt each year.
,Obama administration officials have repeatedly said
,it is not in America's best interests to cut off aid to Egypt.
,Experts note the country has severe economic problems,
,including high unemployment and inflation.
,Many American observers say the United States
,has little influence over what is happening or will happen in Egypt.
,Jeffrey Martini is with the RAND Corporation.
,He says one reason for the lack of influence is a reduction
,in American economic aid to Egypt over the years.
,"In the mid-1980s, the total aid flow to Egypt from the United States
,was equivalent to about seven percent of Egypt's economy.
,That would give you a lot of leverage.
,Today, it's about point-seven percent.
,So a 10-fold drop as compared to the size of the Egyptian economy.
,So you don't get much leverage when you're looking
,at aid flows of point-seven percent the size of the Egyptian economy."
,Brent Scowcroft served as national security advisor
,to two American presidents.
,He says the United States must help in developing a plan
,to re-establish Egypt's economic and political security.
,"What's needed now is to put together a structure
,which can complete the building of an Egyptian political system.
,That is, with a constitution, with elections,
,with governments that broadly reflect the interests of the electorate."
,Mr. Scowcroft says a secure Egypt is important for the Middle East.
,Without a successful Egypt, he says, the area has a serious problem.
,Other observers agree.
,Mirette Mabrouk is with the Atlantic Council's
,Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.
,"A stable, prosperous, if you like,
,but certainly stable and healthy Egypt
,is absolutely vital to the Middle East.
,Otherwise, frankly, no one would care.
,If Egypt were irrelevant, then people would not be paying attention.
,People pay attention because Egypt is vital."
,She and others say the United States and other countries
,should not get directly involved in Egypt
,and instead let the Egyptian political process take its course.

,This week, a U.S. military judge
,ruled in the case of Army Private Bradley Manning.
,The soldier was found guilty of espionage
,for providing secrets
,to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
,The court also found him guilty of
,several other charges.
,The punishment for these crimes
,could add up to more than 100 years in prison.
,The Oklahoma native was found
,not guilty of aiding the enemy.
,That charge could have resulted in a life prison sentence.
,Manning had admitted to what is called
,the largest leak of secret U.S. documents in history.
,The documents included secret diplomatic messages
,and military reports
,about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
,The case was tried at Fort Meade, Maryland,
,close to the grounds of the National Security Agency.
,That is where intelligence contractor
,Edward Snowden once worked.
,He recently leaked secret documents
,on government efforts to collect information
,about American citizens.
,On Wednesday, members of Congress
,met with intelligence and law enforcement officials.
,The officials said
,the U.S. government's information gathering
,does not violate the privacy of citizens.
,And they said these activities
,help to identify and defeat terrorist threats.
,The officials spoke after the Obama administration
,released documents
,that described the government's telephone data collection programs.
,Patrick Leahy is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
,"The patience of the American people is beginning to wear thin.
,But what has to be of more concern
,in a democracy is, the trust of the American people is wearing thin."
,On Wednesday, the administration released
,what once were secret documents
,about the government's collection of telephone records.
,Deputy Attorney General James Cole
,spoke to the Senate committee.
,"These are telephone records maintained by the phone companies.
,They include the number the call was dialed from,
,the number the call was dialed to,
,the date and time of the call and the length of the call.
,The records do not include the names
,or other personal identifying information.
,They do not include cell site or other location information,
,and they do not include the content of any phone calls."
,The government must have special court approval
,to get names or addresses linked to phone numbers.
,It also needs a court order to listen to phone calls.
,Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse
,questioned the lack of voluntary public disclosure by the government.
,"We have a lot of good information
,out there that helps the American public understand these programs.
,But it all came out late.
,.
,There was no organized plan for
,how we rationally declassify this,
,so that the American people can participate in the debate."
,The American Civil Liberties Union,
,an organization that supports individual rights,
,has criticized the government
,for collecting so much information.
,The group says this will change the way people act
,and prevent them from enjoying their freedoms
,under the U.S. Constitution.
,The top lawyer
,for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
,Robert Litt, told lawmakers he disagrees.
,"Collection of this kind of telephone metadata
,from the telephone companies is not a violation
,of anyone's constitutional rights."
,Mr. Litt told the Senate committee that
,public disclosure of the programs
,has damaged the government's ability to protect the nation.

,This week marks the first anniversary of a major exploration effort on Mars.
,It has been 12 months since the exploration device called "Curiosity" landed on the distant planet.
,Curiosity is named for the human condition of wanting to learn or know something.
,The United States space agency, NASA, says Curiosity has driven more than 1.6 kilometers on Mars.
,The device, called a "rover," is about the size of a car.
,Curiosity has found evidence of an ancient riverbed and other signs of wet conditions.
,NASA scientists say that with these discoveries, Curiosity has answered the question of whether conditions on ancient Mars could have supported life.
,Jim Green leads the planetary division at NASA's Science Mission Directorate.
,"We found all the ingredients of life as measured in this material that's deposited in this ancient riverbed.
,Mars was habitable in its past."
,Curiosity is a traveling laboratory that contains 10 scientific instruments.
,The rover has found hydrogen, oxygen and other elements necessary for life.
,The space agency says Curiosity has fired more than 75,000 laser shots.
,The laser turns rocks and soil into gas.
,The equipment on Curiosity then examines and identifies the materials on the Martian surface.
,Curiosity has sent back more than 70,000 images that give a new understanding of Earth's neighboring planet.
,Curiosity's findings will help set future Mars exploration.
,NASA's Jim Green says the next mission will be launched in 2020.
,"Knowing that Mars was an environment that was habitable in its past,
,we're going to start seeking the signs of potential life that could have existed on Mars.
,And that, if we could answer that question, will change everything."
,Space scientists chose to explore Mars instead of other planets because of the Red Planet's similarities with our own.
,NASA Administrator Charles Bolden says Mars is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.
,"If life exists beyond Earth, and I am one who believes that it may very well,
,Mars, for me, is the most likely place that that life will be found."
,Mr. Bolden spoke at an event to mark Curiosity's first year of exploring Mars.
,Curiosity is traveling in the low area called Gale Crater, where it landed last year.
,The crater was formed by an asteroid that hit Mars long ago.
,It is a deep, 150-kilometer-wide area similar to a valley or canyon on Earth.
,Curiosity is moving toward the area called Mount Sharp.
,NASA scientists plan for the device to study the lower levels of that Martian mountain.
,It will search for clues about how the planet has changed over time.
,The rover will also search for a type of soil called "clay." Curiosity has found clay minerals on Mars.
,Clay is evidence of once wet conditions on the planet.
,Curiosity was designed to work for two years, but it could go on exploring and sending information back to Earth much longer.

,Tens of thousands of Egyptians on Friday
,answered calls for a "Day of Rage"
,with protests across the country.
,The marches were the idea
,of the Muslim Brotherhood movement
,of ousted President Mohamed Morsi.
,They took place two days after Egyptian police
,destroyed two large pro-Morsi camps in Cairo.
,The police operation left hundreds dead
,and thousands wounded.
,The protesters were demanding
,that Egypt's new government release the ousted president
,and other leaders of the Brotherhood.
,The Egyptian army has held Mr. Morsi
,since it removed him from office early last month.
,In recent days, violence between civilian groups
,has increased.
,Christians reported that their religious centers
,were attacked on Thursday.
,Some Egyptians raided and set fire
,to two government offices in Giza,
,a city across the Nile River from Cairo.
,Government employee Fehmi Hassan says
,the attackers were supporters of the ousted president.
,"Today, about a thousand supporters
,came and broke the exterior fence
,and hurled stones at the building,
,and they set fire to the governor's office,
,the auditing office and all the governor's cars."
,The United Nations Security Council
,held an emergency meeting
,to discuss the violence in Egypt.
,The Council expressed sympathy to the victims
,and regret for the loss of life.
,It also called for an end to violence by all groups in Egypt.
,The United States and other countries
,have condemned attacks on Mr. Morsi's supporters.
,On Thursday, President Obama
,criticized the violence.
,He also cancelled a major joint military exercise with Egypt.
,"While we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt,
,our traditional cooperation cannot continue
,as usual when civilians are being killed
,in the streets and rights are being rolled back."
,Some observers have criticized Mr. Obama's statements on Egypt.
,They say the United States is showing support
,for the Egyptian military
,if it does not take stronger action.
,Saba Mahmood is with the University of California at Berkeley.
,She says the United States can pressure
,the military-supported government in Egypt
,to end the violence.
,"If the United States is actually
,interested in instituting any kind of democratic change,
,they hold a very crucial card in this, which is
,over $1.8 billion of annual military aid
,that the United States gives to Egypt.
,They can simply say
,that we will suspend that aid
,unless there is an immediate dissolution
,of this intense violence."
,Others see hope for the competing forces in Egypt
,to avoid civil war and carry out the reforms
,that Egyptians wanted in 2011.
,That year, Egypt's military
,answered huge protests
,by supporting the ouster of long-time President Hosni Mubarak.
,Stephen Zunes chairs the Middle Eastern Studies program
,at the University of San Francisco.
,He says civil society has been growing stronger in Egypt
,and across the Arab world.
,"More and more people realize
,that they are ultimately those
,who must decide their own fate.
,And so as tragic as the recent events have been,
,it is just not the final word."
,Professor Zunes says it is not only the Islamists
,who are affected by the suppression of dissent.
,And he says democracy will come to Egypt

,An American military judge this week
,sentenced Army Private Bradley Manning
,to 35 years in prison for espionage.
,Manning provided more than 700,000
,classified files and other materials
,to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
,Officials have described the case
,as the largest leak of restricted documents
,in American history.
,The judge, Colonel Denise Lind,
,announced the sentence Wednesday
,at a military base in Maryland.
,She said the 25-year-old former intelligence specialist
,would be dishonorably discharged
,from the armed forces.
,He will be barred from future military service
,and lose rights to any pay he is owed.
,The Oklahoma native has already spent
,three years in detention.
,He had faced as long as 90 years in prison
,for providing American secrets to WikiLeaks.
,Government lawyers called for a 60-year sentence.
,Under military rules,
,Manning could be considered for
,a conditional release from prison
,in less than nine years.
,The sentencing followed a 12-week trial
,and a long legal battle over the release
,of hundreds of thousands of records.
,They included diplomatic messages
,and American battlefield reports
,from Iraq and Afghanistan.
,One video showed an American helicopter attack
,that killed two civilians.
,Manning says he wanted to show the wrongfulness of war
,and American actions overseas.
,But government lawyers say he betrayed his country.
,Morris Davis formerly served as the government's main lawyer
,in cases against accused terrorists
,at Guantanamo military base in Cuba.
,He says the Manning case required a strong sentence.
,He adds that the information given to WikiLeaks
,did more to damage the image of the United States
,than harm national security.
,"There was no real value to al-Qaida
,or anyone else from these classified documents
,when they could go on Google
,and get the same information.
,It's hard to see where there's any real
,harm here other than just embarrassment
,to the United States government."
,The judge cleared Manning
,of the more serious charge of aiding the enemy.
,In court, Manning expressed regret
,for harming the country.
,The soldier and his lawyers said
,he had idealistic goals in releasing the information.
,They said he believed he could publicize the truth
,about American involvement in the wars
,in Iraq and Afghanistan.
,His lawyer, David Coombs,
,compared Manning's actions to anyone who exposed wartime truths.
,He called the case a defining event in press freedom
,that threatens the flow of information to the public.
,The case raised questions about
,why the Army put Manning in a sensitive position.
,The court heard evidence that he had emotional problems.
,A military doctor described him
,as having a gender identity disorder.
,Manning did not receive treatment while in Iraq.
,On Thursday, Manning announced
,that he is female
,and wants to live as a woman named Chelsea.
,Tommy Sears heads the Center for Military Readiness.

,President Barack Obama
,this week joined hundreds of thousands of Americans
,across the country in marking the 50th anniversary
,of the March on Washington for civil rights.
,The president noted what he called
,"unfinished business" in the struggle
,for equality and justice in the United States.
,His comments come at a time
,when Americans are talking about civil rights
,and race relations.
,Some are still reacting
,to a Florida court's decision
,in the murder trial of George Zimmermann.
,The jury found the neighborhood watch volunteer
,not guilty in the shooting death
,of Trayvon Martin,
,a 17-year-old African American.
,On August 28, 1963, 250,000 people
,marched in Washington for jobs and civil rights.
,It was the biggest demonstration of its kind.
,Many people stood outside the Lincoln Memorial
,to hear speakers talk about civil rights
,for African Americans.
,The march ended
,with civil rights leader Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.
,giving his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.
,His comments energized
,the civil rights movement in the United States
,and led to important laws,
,including the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
,The law bars major forms of discrimination
,against minorities and women.
,Last Wednesday,
,the nation's first black president
,stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
,Mr. Obama remembered King
,and the sacrifices
,of those who marched here in Washington.
,He said the marchers brought change
,not only for African Americans,
,but also for other groups
,and for those hoping for freedom around the world.
,The president's speech marked one of the first times
,since he took office in 2009
,that he has spoken about issues of race.
,It also came two months after the nation's highest court
,ruled against part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
,Mr. Obama said those who suggest
,little has changed in America dishonor
,the marchers of 50 years ago.
,At the same time,
,he said work toward racial equality is not complete.
,The president noted that challenges to voting rights,
,high unemployment rates and other problems need attention.
,"To secure the gains that this country has made
,requires constant vigilance,
,not complacency, whether by challenging those
,who erect new barriers to the vote,
,or ensuring that the scales of justice work
,equally for all, and the criminal justice system
,is not simply a pipeline
,from under-funded schools to overcrowded jails.
,It requires vigilance."
,The crowd on the National Mall
,here in Washington
,also heard from present-day civil rights leaders,
,movie stars and two former U.S. presidents.
,Like Mr. Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter
,belong to the Democratic Party.
,Mr. Carter also criticized the Supreme Court decision
,on the Voting Rights Act.
,"I believe we all know
,how Dr. King would have reacted
,to the new ID requirements
,to exclude certain voters,
,especially African Americans.
,I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted
,to the Supreme Court striking down
,a crucial part of the Voters Rights Act
,just recently passed overwhelmingly by Congress."
,Another speaker was Martin Luther King's youngest child,
,Bernice King.
,She spoke about her father's message
,to "Let Freedom Ring."
,"Today, 50 years later, my friends,
,we are still crippled by practices
,and policies steeped in racial pride,
,hatred and hostility,
,some of which have us standing our ground
,rather than finding common ground."
,Some people in the crowd
,also took part in the 1963 march.
,They said they are prepared
,to keep the dream of racial equality alive.

,This week, a United States Senate committee
,voted in support of a possible
,American military strike against Syria.
,The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
,approved a proposed resolution by a vote of 10 to seven.
,The resolution gives President Barack Obama power
,to take military action against Syria
,because the United States says the Syrian government
,used chemical weapons against civilians.
,The resolution calls for limited U.S. action
,lasting no more than 90 days.
,It does not permit the use of American ground troops in Syria.
,The resolution now goes to the full Senate.
,The House of Representatives must also vote on it.
,The Senate committee vote came less than a week
,after United Nations chemical weapons inspectors left Syria.
,U.N. officials sent the inspection team
,to investigate an attack that took place 10 days earlier.
,American officials say more than 1,400 people
,were killed in the attack, near Damascus.
,The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
,denies using chemical weapons.
,It says Syrian rebels used them against government soldiers.
,Last Saturday, President Obama spoke to Americans
,and the world about Syria.
,He said U.S. intelligence is clear that
,“well over 1,000 people” were killed
,-- gassed to death by their own government.
,He denounced what he called the worst
,chemical weapons attack of the 21st century.
,President Obama and some leading lawmakers
,have expressed strong support for military strikes against Syria.
,But a recent study found that 59 percent of
,Americans questioned oppose the idea.
,Christopher Hill is a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq
,and a former special representative to Kosovo.
,He supports limited military action against Syria.
,He says the world needs to send a strong signal
,that anyone who uses chemical weapons will be punished.
,“But the problem is we don’t
,have an overall way forward on Syria.
,People are out there fighting in Syria,
,either on Assad’s forces or against Assad,
,because they have no idea what the future of the country
,is going to hold and therefore they feel that in order
,to safeguard their future, they need to fight.”
,Retired U.S. Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni
,agrees with Mr. Hill.
,General Zinni headed “Operation Desert Fox,”
,a series of strikes against Iraq in 1998.
,He says American military action
,will strengthen rebel forces allied with al-Qaida.
,“Any strikes on Assad weaken him.
,When you weaken him,
,you strengthen the opposition.
,Those extremists are also part of the opposition.”
,Some experts say a U.S. military strike
,might incite the Shi’ite militant group Hezbollah
,to attack Western targets or Israel.
,Others say the Syrian military might use
,more chemical weapons against rebels and civilians.
,General Zinni says the situation is like a theatrical production.
,“Once Assad goes -- when, and if
,-- this could even be a greater mess than it is now.
,I mean, this civil war isn’t over
,because it will have an ‘Act Two’ to it.”
,The former general says that “act”
,could see Syrian opposition groups fighting each other
,after President Assad is gone.

,What seemed like an unplanned comment
,about Syria's chemical weapons
,had a major effect on world events this week.
,American Secretary of State John Kerry
,spoke last Monday at a press conference in London.
,He was reacting to questions
,about possible American action
,to answer a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.
,One reporter asked the secretary
,whether there is anything Syria's president can do
,to avoid an American military strike.
,"Sure, he can turn over
,every single bit of his chemical weapons
,to the international community in the next week."
,Mr. Kerry made clear he was speaking theoretically,
,and did not expect anything like that to happen.
,"But he is not about to do that,
,cannot be done, obviously."
,But Russia seized on the idea
,and persuaded Syria to do the same.
,That brought plans for American congressional votes
,on military action to a halt.
,It also led France to suggest a United Nations
,Security Council resolution on chemical weapons in Syria.
,President Obama has said
,he would accept a diplomatic solution
,if it can be carried out.
,But that would likely take weeks, at least.
,Some officials in the United States and overseas are concerned.
,They fear that Syria and Russia will use Mr. Kerry's comment
,to direct attention away from the reported chemical attack
,and to avoid American action.
,Mr. Obama has said the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
,must be punished for violating the nearly century old ban
,on the use of chemical weapons.
,He called for American action to prevent
,future use of chemical weapons in Syria.
,He proposed limited airstrikes on government targets.
,The airstrikes could happen quickly if Congress approves.
,Joanna Kidd is a security expert with London's King's College.
,She says any move to place Syria's chemical weapons
,under international control would take a long time,
,if it could be done at all.
,"It is a job that would take several months to do.
,And, of course, one should not forget that obviously
,there is a civil war going on in Syria,
,which would greatly complicate the process."
,The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
,could provide inspectors to document controls
,on Syria's chemical weapons.
,But experts say there may not be enough inspectors
,to cover all of Syria.
,And they say the organization may not be willing
,to send them into the middle of the civil war.
,Late this week, the Syrian government took its first step
,toward joining the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.
,The convention bans the development,
,production and use of chemical weapons.
,Until now, only seven countries, including Syria,
,have failed to approve the treaty.
,Mr. Assad says his country is now ready to give its approval.
,But he says Syria cannot be "brought to the final stage"
,while it is under the threat of an American missile strike.
,In a related development, Secretary Kerry
,and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Geneva.
,Mr. Kerry said they held what he called "constructive" talks
,on ending Syria's chemical weapons program.
,He said they also agreed to do "homework" as part of an effort
,to get Syria's warring sides to a conference on a temporary government.

,He was identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis,
,a former Navy Reserve sailor.
,At the time of the shooting,
,he was an information technology specialist
,with a private company that worked for the Defense Department.
,His mental condition has become a central issue in the investigation.
,He had recently told police that he was hearing voices.
,Mr. Alexis was arrested in two separate shooting incidents
,in 2004 and 2010.
,Yet he held a security clearance,
,which enabled him to enter a secure military area.
,This week, many Americans were remembering the victims of the attack.
,On Capitol Hill, lawmakers suspended debate for a few minutes.
,Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said a few words.
,"My thoughts are with those who are suffering
,as a result of the loss of their loved ones
,and also those people recovering from the wounds."
,Senator Chris Murphy represents Connecticut,
,where a gunman killed 26 people
,at an elementary school in Newtown last year.
,Since then, he has been the Senate's leading supporter of
,gun control legislation.
,He says the Navy Yard shootings show why stronger laws are needed.
,"People out there do not understand why Congress does nothing
,as these shootings continue to mount.
,I think people in Newtown shake their heads
,when they see another shooting
,and further potential indifference from Congress."
,Like Mr. Murphy, Illinois Senator Richard Durbin
,is a member of the Democratic Party.
,Mr. Durbin notes that gun control legislation died
,in the Senate earlier this year.
,He says the failure was mainly the result of Republican opposition
,to new restrictions and requirements for gun purchases.
,"We have to do everything we can to keep guns
,out of the hands of those who would misuse them
,– felons who have a history of misusing firearms,
,the mentally unstable who cannot be trusted to have a firearm."
,Republican lawmakers have shown little interest
,in re-opening the gun control debate.
,But several say the Navy Yard shootings raise other important issues.
,Senator Lindsey Graham says the shooter never should have been cleared
,for duty as a military contract worker.
,"To me, it is not about gun control.
,It is about what has happened with our contractor force.
,How could he pass a background check to get a job
,with the federal government after he had misused a weapon twice?
,When you shoot a guy's tires out because you are mad at him,
,you are a good candidate not to work for the federal government."
,Another Republican senator, John McCain, had this to say:
,"We also should focus our attention on people
,who show mental instability
,and whether they should have access to weapons or not.
,I think all Americans are in agreement on that."
,Congressional members say something should be done
,to prevent attacks like the one on Monday.
,But there is no solution acceptable to everyone.

,It has been a week since gunmen attacked a shopping center in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
,The attack left more than 70 people dead.
,The Kenyan Red Cross said Thursday that about 60 others were still missing.
,The attack left many people feeling powerless and shocked.
,But instead of hiding at home, Kenyans have come out to donate food, clothing, their own blood and money.
,The country appears more united because of the attack.
,The violence at the Westgate shopping mall lasted four days.
,During that time, medical workers offered help to victims and security forces at a nearby community center.
,Those seeking assistance often had to run for cover as gunshots and explosions were heard.
,A small army of volunteers came to the center.
,They provided food, medical services and emotional support to an endless line of people.
,Vimal Shah helped to direct the community center operation.
,He says so many people wanted to feed Kenyan security forces or help the victims that he had to turn people away.
,Nzioka Waita works for Safaricom.
,In just two days, the communications company collected more than $700,000 for the Kenyan Red Cross.
,"This is the Kenya I know and I grew up knowing.
,One that was built on the spirit of ‘Harambee,' spirit of togetherness.
,So you know, I am pleasantly surprised in how quickly the funds have come together,
,but not entirely surprised that we've pulled together from the various communities and religious affiliations."
,He also says there has been huge support from the many Kenyans who live overseas.
,But the mall attack has also incited some tension in Kenya.
,The Somali Islamist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack.
,Some reports say the attackers had freed some Muslims, but executed other people.
,After those stories appeared, there was criticism of Muslims and Somalis on social networking websites.
,There are still tribal tensions left from the Kenyan elections earlier this year.
,Vimal Shah says the crisis last weekend brought the nation together.
,But he hopes that Kenyans do not start fearing one another after seeing such violence.
,"This is pure terrorism.
,This is not about religion.
,This is not about one religion against another religion.
,And I think Kenyans stand together.
,We've got all different tribes coming together,
,all different people coming together, and saying, ‘United we stand, divided we fall.'"
,Naima Amir collects money for St. John Ambulance Kenya, a medical aid group.
,She says the mall attack shows that Kenyans have closed the wounds from the country's 2007 elections.
,"People have learned to appreciate peace.
,They have learned to appreciate each other.
,And the diversity within ourselves is a strength and not a line to divide the country."
,Naima Amir is a Muslim.
,She describes the attack as "senseless violence" that has nothing to do with Islam.
,On Tuesday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also appealed for unity.
,He declared that Kenya would defeat "the monster of terrorism," one that wanted to tear the country apart.

,This week, a political dispute in Washington led to a partial shutdown of the United States government for the first time in almost 20 years.
,Agencies sent home more than 800,000 workers --
,about one-third of the federal work force.
,The new budget year began Tuesday, October 1.
,But Republicans in Congress blocked even short-term spending for many government operations.
,They demanded that Democrats change the Affordable Care Act, the new health care law often called Obamacare.
,The Democrats refused.
,The shutdown did not stop Tuesday's launch of online marketplaces, called exchanges, at the center of the law.
,The federal government and states started websites for millions of uninsured Americans to buy health plans or pay a tax penalty.
,Opponents of Obamacare say it will force people and small businesses to buy insurance policies against their will.
,At the heart of the dispute is a clash between the two major political parties over the role of the central government in American life.
,The political fighting between Democrats and Republicans began to intensify during the 1990s.
,That followed the election of Democrat Bill Clinton as president.
,Differences over spending and the role of government led to two government shutdowns.
,The disputed presidential election of 2000 brought Republican George W. Bush to office.
,University of Virginia expert Larry Sabato says the political battles only deepened during his second term.
,"There is no question that the polarization increased first with the Bush presidency,
,because of the Iraq war and his handling of Hurricane Katrina.
,Then it accelerated once President Obama was elected."
,The divide grew wider when President Barack Obama pushed his health care reform law through Congress in 2010 without a single Republican vote.
,That in turn helped to fuel the rise of Tea Party groups around the country.
,The Tea Party is a conservative voting group within the Republican Party.
,Republicans have made several attempts to either defund the Affordable Care Act or delay it.
,The law is one of the most important acts of Barack Obama's presidency.
,Peter Brown of Quinnipiac University in Connecticut studies public opinion.
,"Republicans like smaller government and lower government spending and therefore are more opposed to Obamacare.
,Democrats tend to be more supportive in general of government solutions to problems,
,and they see Obamacare as the right thing to do to help on the health care issue."
,Currently, Republicans control the House of Representatives; Democrats hold the Senate and the White House.
,A group of conservative Republicans in the House have been leading the opposition to the health care law.
,Many of them now depend on strong support from Tea Party activists to get elected.
,Larry Sabato says many of them are willing, at least for now, to accept the political blame for forcing the government to shut down.
, districts.
,The only thing they have to worry about is a challenge from the right in the Republican primary.
,So they do not want to let anybody get to their right."
,For the moment, Larry Sabato sees no quick end to the shutdown.
,Political observer Charlie Cook says some of the Republican opposition is also driven by deep feelings against President Obama.
,"There are a lot of Republicans where if President Obama said ‘up,' they would say ‘down.'
,The last politically driven government shutdown began in December of 1995.
,It lasted three weeks.
,And right now there is another issue.
,Congress will soon have to raise the borrowing limit or risk the United States not being able to make all of its loan payments.
,Congress must renew the government's power to borrow money by October 17 or risk a first-ever federal default.

,Egypt is criticizing an American decision
,to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars
,in aid to the country.
,An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official says
,the decision is wrong.
,He says his country is prepared to carry out
,what he called a political road map,
,which includes plans for elections next year.
,The Obama administration said this week
,it was suspending the delivery of major weapons to Egypt
,because of delays in progress toward an inclusive government.
,The decision followed an investigation of events
,since the Egyptian military ousted
,President Mohamed Morsi three months ago.
,President Obama has also decided to suspend $260 million
,in assistance to the government that followed the ouster.
,Mr. Obama has said there can be no business
,as usual following the overthrow of Mr. Morsi.
,American officials say this suspension
,is a way of expressing that point.
,But it is far from a complete break in American assistance.
,The United States will continue to support programs
,that it says directly help the Egyptian people.
,It will also continue financing programs
,that support what it calls "vital security objectives."
,These include help aimed at securing Egypt's borders.
,Jonathan Broder is with Congressional Quarterly,
,a publication that reports on American politics.
,He says Mr. Obama has been under pressure
,for not taking stronger steps
,after the ouster of Egypt's democratically-elected leader.
,"There is the image that President Obama
,wants to present to the world as someone
,who stands up for human rights and for democracy.
,And the images of Egyptian soldiers
,killing protesters on the streets of Cairo
,is a very negative one in the United States.
,And there's pressure on him from human rights organizations
,and from some in Congress to suspend the aid."
,American officials say Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
,discussed the move in a telephone call on Wednesday
,with Egypt's Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
,During the call, the two men were said to have re-stated
,the importance of their countries' relations
,in guaranteeing Middle East security.
,Since July, the Egyptian military has led a campaign
,against suspected militants and supporters of Mr. Morsi
,and the Muslim Brotherhood.
,At least 1,000 people have been killed.
,Most were Islamists.
,In recent days, more violence was reported,
,with attacks on security forces and clashes
,between protesters and police.
,Some Egyptians predict it only lead
,to increased use of military force.
,Emad Shahin is a public policy professor
,with The American University in Cairo.
,He thinks military leaders are preparing
,for a final battle with their long-time enemies.
,"They think that the plan by which they managed to charge,
,to mobilize the anger of the people against Morsi's rule
,and administration and so on, has gained a momentum
,and it is really time to break down the Islamists."
,For now, many Egyptians are still supporting
,the military against its opponents.
,But there are questions of how long that can last.
,Mustafa Labbad is director of the Al Sharq Center
,for Regional and Strategic Studies.
,"After a while you have to solve your social and economic problems.
,And it wouldn't matter if you are wearing a uniform or casual wear.

,Late Wednesday night,
,the United States Congress approved a deal
,to end a partial government shutdown.
,The deal also increases the nation's debt limit.
,President Obama signed the bill into law
,shortly after midnight.
,The shutdown lasted 16 days
,and affected hundreds of thousands of federal employees.
,It was the first shutdown in 17 years.
,However, the deal to reopen the government
,will only pay for operations through January 15.
,And it only extends the debt limit until February 7.
,Extending the debt limit
,will let the government borrow enough money
,to pay for programs already approved by Congress.
,The Treasury Department said
,the limit needed to rise by October 17
,so that the United States
,could borrow enough money to pay all its bills.
,Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen announced
,the results of the vote in the House of Representatives.
,"On this vote the yeas are 285,
,the nays are 144, the motion is adopted."
,The pressure had been on House Speaker John Boehner.
,Earlier in the day, Mr. Boehner talked about
,what Republicans had been seeking.
,He spoke to radio station WLW
,in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.
,"We have been locked in a fight over here,
,trying to bring government down to size,
,trying to do our best to stop Obamacare.
,We fought the good fight, we just did not win."
,The shutdown began October 1 after House Republicans
,linked passage of a spending bill
,to an effort to block the health care law.
,Republicans hold the majority in the 435-member House.
,But the bill passed mostly with the votes of Democrats.
,Fewer than 90 Republicans voted for the bill.
,And none of their leaders came to the House floor
,to speak in the final debate.
,Democrats supported the bill after Speaker Boehner
,agreed to allow a vote without changing Obamacare.
,Earlier the Senate passed the same bill
,by a vote of 81 to 18,
,with strong support from Democrats and Republicans.
,Hours after signing the bill into law,
,President Obama noted "there are no winners here."
,"The last few weeks have inflicted completely,
,unnecessary damage on our economy.
,We don't know yet the full scope of the damage,
,but every analyst out there believes it slowed our growth.
,We know that families have gone without paychecks
,or services they depend on.
,We know that potential home buyers have gotten fewer mortgages
,and small business loans have been put on hold.
,We know that consumers have cut back on spending
,and that half of all CEOs say that the shutdown
,and the threat of shutdown set back their plans
,to hire over the next six months."
,Congress agreed to pay government workers
,for the time away from their jobs.
,But economists say some businesses affected by the shutdown
,will not be able to recover their losses.
,For example, the shutdown closed national parks.
,That cost nearby businesses when people canceled park visits.
,As part of the deal, House and Senate leaders
,have appointed a joint budget committee
,to negotiate a compromise spending plan.
,The goal is to reach an agreement by December 13.
,President Obama says,
,"We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis."
,He says with the shutdown over,
,attention should now turn to long-term budget concerns
,and issues like passing an immigration reform bill.

,This week,
,two human rights groups accused
,the United States of killing more civilians
,in drone strikes than American officials say.
,The groups say many of the attacks
,appeared to be illegal under international law.
,Human Rights Watch investigated
,six drone strikes in Yemen since 2009.
,It found that at least 57 civilians died in the attacks.
,Letta Tayler studies terrorist acts
,and anti-terrorism efforts for the group.
,"Two of the six cases that we examined in my report
,show that the U.S. indiscriminately killed civilians.
,This is a clear violation of international law."
,The report says some drone strikes violated the rules
,set by President Obama to justify such attacks.
,The president has said the unmanned aircraft
,can be used when responding
,to an immediate threat to the United States.
,He also said they can be used
,when there is no hope of capturing a targeted terrorist,
,and "near certainty" that civilians will not be harmed.
,At the White House,
,Press Secretary Jay Carney rejected accusations
,that drone strikes violated international law.
,"To the extent these reports claim that the U.S.
,has acted contrary to international law,
,we would strongly disagree.
,The administration has repeatedly emphasized
,the extraordinary care that we take
,to make sure counterterrorism actions
,are in accordance with all applicable law."
,Amnesty International examined
,nine American drone attacks in Pakistan.
,It says it found evidence that more than 30 civilians
,were killed in four of the strikes.
,A United Nations report has estimated
,that drone strikes in Pakistan killed 400 civilians
,over the past 10 years.
,Both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch
,are calling for more congressional supervision of
,the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.
,The first American drone attack in Pakistan took place in 2004.
,Many observers believe there was a secret agreement
,in which Pakistan privately approved of drone strikes
,but publicly condemned them.
,Pakistani officials say they are strongly opposed to the attacks.
,They condemn them as a violation of their country's sovereignty
,– the right to be free from interference by another country.
,They also say the attacks are fueling militancy in Pakistan.
,North Waziristan has long been considered
,a center for al-Qaida militants and the Haqqani network.
,That group has been blamed
,for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan.
,The United States has long pressured the Pakistani military
,to move against extremists in North Waziristan.
,However, some officials believe
,that state control has almost disappeared in the territory.
,On Wednesday,
,President Obama and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
,met at the White House.
,They discussed cooperation in fighting terrorism
,and concerns about what the president called
,"senseless violence and extremism" in Pakistan.
,Afterward they spoke to reporters.
,Prime Minister Sharif said the two countries
,will continue to increase cooperation against terrorists.
,But he also called for no more drone attacks.
,"Pakistan and the United States have a strong,
,ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.
,We have agreed to further strengthen this cooperation.
,I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting,
,emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes."

,European officials have traveled to Washington seeking more information about American spying programs.
,On Tuesday, the director of the National Security Agency, Army General Keith Alexander, defended the NSA at a hearing in Congress.
,He denied accusations that the NSA collected the records of millions of French and Spanish telephone calls.
,"Those screenshots that show, or at least lead people to believe that we,
,NSA, or the United States, collected that information is false.
,And it's false that it was collected on European citizens.
,It was neither."
,The accusations follow information leaks by Edward Snowden,
,the former NSA contract worker who has been given asylum in Russia.
,General Alexander said the agency has received targeted information from phone calls by some Europeans,
,through NATO allies.
,"The sources of the metadata include data legally collected by NSA under its various authorities,
,as well as data provided to NSA by foreign partners.
,To be perfectly clear, this is not information that we collected on European citizens."
,Metadata would include details about a call, but not the contents of the call.
,But earlier reports said intelligence officials listened to the calls of as many as 35 world leaders,
, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
,The European Parliament sent a delegation to Washington to express anger.
,The delegation met with members of Congress and government officials.
,Parliament member Jan Philipp Albrecht told VOA that the spying on Chancellor Merkel was simply too much.
,"Now people are really concerned.
,They see that it's not any longer connected to a terrorist threat,
,because Angela Merkel is not a terrorist, or not part of a terrorist ring.
,And they think that there was a red line crossed, which is now spying on everybody about everything."
,Mr. Albrecht called for American legislation to balance national security needs with the responsibility to protect basic civil rights.
,On Tuesday, American lawmakers held a hearing on possible changes to NSA spying programs.
,Mike Rogers is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
,He says it is overly simplistic to think that other countries do not operate their own spying programs.
,But another Republican Party lawmaker, Senator Susan Collins, took a different position.
,In her words, "Friends do not spy on friends."
,Later in the week, the Washington Post reported that the NSA secretly broke into the communication networks of Google and Yahoo.
,Both Internet companies said they have not approved the reported actions involving their communication links.
,General Alexander has said his agency does not enter Google and Yahoo servers.
,He said the NSA gains access to data by "court order."
,Paul Tiao formerly served as an adviser to the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
,He says all the publicity has made the NSA's job harder.
,"NSA is facing significant challenges, both in terms of its public reputation,
,the level of trust that the public has in NSA, and then also policy issues,
,legislation that's pending that the new NSA director is going to have to deal with.
,That could change the nature of NSA's authority with respect to its intelligence collection mission."
,Obama administration officials have promised to examine the NSA's programs.

,Two American states elected governors this week, while several big cities chose mayors.
,The elections were the first since the troubled launch of the new federal health-care website and the 16-day partial shutdown of the government.
,Conservative Republicans in Congress, including Tea Party members,
,supported the shutdown as part of their opposition to the program known as Obamacare.
,Political experts looked at the governors' races for clues to how Americans may vote in congressional elections next year.
,Voters will choose all 435 members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100 senators.
,Observers think the government shutdown helped Democrat Terry McAuliffe win the governor's race in Virginia.
,Many federal workers live there and federal spending is important to the state economy.
,Mr. McAuliffe defeated Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican with strong Tea Party ties.
,Mr. Cuccinelli stayed close in the race by attacking President Barack Obama and the health care law.
,"Virginia understands that Obamacare is a failure and that you want to be in charge of your health care, and not the government."
,But voters chose Mr. McAuliffe in his second try for public office.
,"Just think about what Virginia has been able to accomplish when we work together."
,The newly elected governor has close ties to former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
,In the other governor's race, voters in New Jersey re-elected Republican Chris Christie.
,He won 60 percent of the vote with the support of many Democrats.
,"Leadership is much less about talking than it is about listening.
,About bringing people around the table, listening to each other, showing them respect."
,Mr. Christie received much praise for his leadership after Superstorm Sandy hit the state a year ago.
,Many people see him as a possible 2016 candidate for president.
,Tad Devine, an adviser to Democrats, says Governor Christie's re-election offers an important lesson.
,"He has been able to take a very Democratic state – Obama won New Jersey by 17 points in the last two elections –
,and become a governor who could not only win a close election as he did the first time,
,but win a landslide election."
,Ford O'Connell is a Republican strategist.
,He says Tea Party Republicans need to learn from the winning candidates.
,"Well, it leaves the Tea Party really in an echo chamber, just talking to the base.
,The real problem for the Tea Party is how do they expand their appeal beyond the Republican base."
,Some people predict a battle for the heart and soul of the party.
,Will the Republicans move toward the conservatism of the Tea Party movement or away from it? Ford O'Connell is not sure.
,"Depending on how this battle turns out, it could lead to more dysfunction and government shutdowns.
,And that's something that people all over the world have an eye on because America is still the most robust economy in the world."
,In New York City, voters on Tuesday elected Bill de Blasio as mayor.

,The Philippine government is defending its efforts to get assistance to victims of Typhoon Haiyan.
,Many have received little or no assistance since the storm struck a week ago.
,Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said Friday in the city of Tacloban that the need is massive,
,immediate and not everyone can be reached.
,The aircraft carrier USS George Washington and other US Navy ships arrived in the Philippines this week to help with disaster relief operations.
,The ships brought helicopters and emergency aid.
,The Navy is deploying the helicopters to inspect damage from Typhoon Haiyan.
,The aircraft are also being used to transport supplies to affected communities.
,The aircraft carrier also has medical services and can produce 1.5 million liters of fresh water a day.
,The storm displaced hundreds of thousands of people.
,The country's chief of disaster relief said Friday that at least 3,600 people are known to have died.
,The amount of food and other aid sent to the Philippines has increased in recent days.
,But moving the aid from airports or other areas has been a slow process, in part because wreckage blocks many roads.
,Scientists say Typhoon Haiyan was one of the strongest storms on record ever to hit land.
,Some people wonder whether man-made climate change played a part in the typhoon.
,Bob Ward is with the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.
,"There's certainly strong circumstantial evidence because we know that the strength of tropical cyclones,
,hurricanes, typhoons, depends very much on sea surface temperatures.
,They act as the fuel.
,And we've got very warm waters in the Pacific at the moment,
,which have been increasing because of climate change,
,and those very warm waters are what powered this typhoon."
,Bob Ward says the intensity of storms seems to be increasing.
,"Our models are not very clear at the moment.
,But we might expect in the future that we might even see fewer,
,but those that do occur will be much stronger than we're experiencing now."
,Benedict Dempsey is with the aid group Save the Children.
,He says detailed weather predictions meant that some aid workers were already in place when the storm hit.
,"Half a dozen people went into the path of the storm
,in order to be prepared for the response in Tacloban and elsewhere in the Philippines."
,He says aid agencies are learning to prepare for natural disasters of this kind.
,"Between around 2002 and 2011, on average over 260 million people a year are being affected by disasters.
,And so we're seeing the reality of these trends acting out on the ground,
,and it's absolutely something that we're having to prepare to respond to in the future."
,Benny Peiser is director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation.
,His group questions whether human activities are to blame for rising temperatures.
,He says people should be concerned about disaster preparation instead of cutting gases linked to climate change.
,"This was the 20th tropical storm to have hit the Philippines this year.
,So this is going to continue no matter what we decide on CO2, these storms will continue."
,Climate change talks are taking place in Warsaw, Poland.
,At the talks, the Philippine representative appealed for an agreement to cut industrial gases like carbon dioxide.
,Scientist Bob Ward says the delegates should pay close attention.
,"I think this typhoon will focus minds very much on the fact that if we squabble and delay in getting an agreement,
,we're going to see more and more of these kind of events with very, very severe human costs."
,But observers at the Warsaw talks say a deal on cutting greenhouse gases still appears to be far away.

,Delegates from nearly 200 countries
,have spent the past two weeks in Warsaw, Poland.
,More than 9,000 representatives gathered
,for a United Nations conference on climate change.
,Organizers called the meeting to work toward a treaty
,to fight rising temperatures on our planet.
,The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.
,Several environmental groups
,walked out of the climate talks earlier this week.
,They were protesting what they considered a lack of progress
,towards a deal to limit carbon dioxide
,and other global warming emissions.
,Studies have shown links between such gases and the rise in temperatures.
,In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency
,is leading government efforts to fight climate change.
,The agency just ended a series of public hearings across the country.
,The EPA was seeking comments as it considers
,tightening clean air rules for coal-burning power plants.
,America's 1,000 coal-burning power plants
,supply 40 percent of the nation's electricity.
,The plants are responsible for one-third of the global warming emissions.
,The Obama Climate Action Plan has promised
,to cut the production of such gases.
,Mitch McConnell is the leader of the Republican Party
,in the United States Senate.
,He spoke at the EPA hearing in support of his home state of Kentucky,
,which is a major coal producer.
,"By now it is clear that this administration and your agency
,have declared a war on coal.
,For Kentucky, this means a war on jobs and on our state's economy."
,Brian Patton also spoke at the EPA hearing.
,Mr. Patton comes from a long line of Kentucky coal mine workers.
,Today he is president of James River Coal Service.
,His company has dismissed 725 workers over the past six months.
,He fears that new rules could bring even greater hardship
,to an area that is already economically depressed.
,"Understand, these are communities of just 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people.
,And when you have that type of an economic impact
,due to regulations that come from Washington, DC
,-- that have very little understanding of what the outcome
,is for the local folks, for folks that get up and go to work every day
,and what that impact will be for their families
,in the future, and that's wrong."
,David Doniger is a climate policy expert
,with the Natural Resources Defense Council,
,one of the nation's largest environmental groups.
,He says it is the duty of the EPA to control carbon as a pollutant.
,He wants the agency to establish new rules
,that would move the United States toward a cleaner energy environment.
,"No one is proposing standards that would knock out all those power plants.
,We're talking about a shift from the dirtier ones to the cleaner ones,
,and from all those fossil fuel-powered ones towards renewable
,and even nuclear sources of energy."
,He says the government is responsible for protecting clean air,
,not protecting old and dirty power stations.
,"That's the only way that we can continue to have the way of life we want
,without running into the wall on climate change impacts,
,which in turn will come back and destroy the quality of life we have."
,The EPA is now considering comments from the nationwide hearings.
,The agency plans to announce proposed rule changes in June.

,This week, Iranian and international negotiators agreed on first steps to limit Iran's nuclear program.
,They also agreed to ease international economic pressure on Iran.
,The agreement was reached early Sunday in Switzerland.
,Secretary of State John Kerry described the agreement as a first step toward a possible peaceful settlement with Iran.
,American officials say Iran will dilute or weaken its near weapons grade uranium so it can not be used in weapons.
,Iran has also agreed to inspections of its nuclear centers.
,In exchange, the United States and other countries will ease actions meant to punish Iran for its nuclear activities.
,But they will continue the strongest restrictions on Iran's oil exports and banking system.
,The deal was delayed because of a dispute over Iran's claim to a right to enrich the metal uranium.
,The United States says no such right exists for any country.
,Different levels of enriched uranium are needed to produce nuclear power and nuclear weapons.
,Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif spoke to reporters after the deal was announced.
,"Many times, at least twice very explicitly in this text, this recognition is there that Iran will have an enrichment program.
,And we believe that we are right, and we are exercising that right and we only require respect for that right."
,The nuclear agreement has many critics.
,Israeli officials say it does nothing to stop Iranian efforts to build nuclear weapons.
,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the deal.
,He said this is not a historic agreement, but a historic mistake.
,In Washington, President Barack Obama sought to answer concerns of Israel and American partners in the Middle East.
,Mr. Obama said the deal halts Iran's nuclear program for the first time in almost 10 years.
,He said the next step will be to negotiate a detailed and lasting solution.
,The president appealed to American lawmakers not to move forward with new sanctions against Iran.
,Senator Saxby Chambliss is a member of the Republican Party from Georgia.
,He objects to any easing of economic pressure against Iran.
,"Now is just not the time to ease sanctions when they are working."
,Many people are waiting to see what happens next.
,Ephrim Asculai was an official with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
,He now works at the Institute for Defense Security Studies in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.
,He says the agreement answers many concerns over Iran's nuclear activities.
,But he is worried about some of the details,
,like whether Iran will let international inspectors visit all of its nuclear centers.
,Mark Fitzpatrick is with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
,He says the two sides must now honor the agreement to show they can honor a deal.
,"Implementing it will show that they both mean what they say.
,It'll be very important that the two sides carry it out so that both sides can show their doubters –
,and both sides have real skeptics and doubters –
,that the other side can strike a deal and keep to it."

,People around the world are remembering Nelson Mandela,
,South Africa's first black president.
,He died Thursday at the age of 95.
,South African President Jacob Zuma said
,the nation "has lost its greatest son,
,and our people have lost a father."
,Mandela had been in poor health for several years.
,He was repeatedly treated in hospitals,
,most recently for a lung infection.
,He became infected with tuberculosis many years ago while in prison.
,Nelson Mandela was the main leader
,in efforts to end white minority rule in South Africa.
,He spent 27 years in prison for his part in fighting apartheid
,-- the nation's policy of discrimination against blacks.
,Many world leaders, past and present,
,are remembering Nelson Mandela.
,Frederick W. de Klerk was South Africa's last apartheid leader.
,He freed Mandela from prison in 1990.
,Later, the two men won the Nobel Peace Prize.
,Mr. de Klerk said people will remember Mandela
,for the importance he placed on reconciliation
,-- being able to reach a settlement between conflicting sides.
,He said their relationship was, in his words, "often stormy,"
,but he said they were "always able to come together at critical moments."
,South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu
,was active in the struggle to end apartheid.
,He also was a friend of Nelson Mandela.
,He praised Mandela for his actions and statements
,after he was released from prison.
,Archbishop Tutu said instead of "calling for his pound of flesh,
,he proclaimed the message of forgiveness and reconciliation."
,In the United States, President Barack Obama
,called Mandela an influential,
,brave and profoundly good human being.
,Mr. Obama said Mandela will be remembered
,for leaving a free South Africa at peace.
,"I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration
,from Nelson Mandela's life.
,My very first political action
,-- the first thing I ever did that involved an issue,
,or a policy, or politics -- was a protest against apartheid.
,I would study his words and his writings.
,The day he was released from prison
,gave me a sense of what human beings can do
,when they're guided by their hopes and not by their fears."
,President Obama said flags at the White House
,and other government buildings will be lowered through Monday
,in honor of Nelson Mandela.
,Few foreign leaders are honored by the United States in this way.
,Former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton
,and George W. Bush also praised Mandela
,as a champion of freedom, human dignity and equality.
,Another former president -- George H.W. Bush
,-- called Mandela "a man of tremendous moral courage"
,who changed the direction of history in his country.
,In London, British Prime Minister David Cameron
,called Mandela a true global hero.
,In his words, a great light has gone out in the world.
,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mandela,
,"one of the most honorable figures of our time."
,Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called him
,"a symbol of freedom from colonialism and occupation."
,He called Mr. Mandela's death "a great loss."

,This week, North Korea
,executed the uncle of leader Kim Jong Un.
,The official Korean Central News Agency said
,Jang Song Thaek was put to death on Thursday
,after facing a special military court.
,It said Jang was found guilty of attempting
,to overthrow the state, party and leadership.
,He was also accused of womanizing and drug abuse.
,The announcement came just days after Jang Song Thaek
,was publicly ousted from power
,for suspected disloyalty and corruption.
,Korean Central Television broadcast images of his arrest
,on Sunday at a meeting of the Korean Workers' Party.
,On Friday, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper
,published pictures of Jang at the military trial.
,They showed him lowering his head,
,with guards on both sides.
,Andrei Lankov is a professor of Korean history
,at Kookmin University in South Korea.
,He says ousters, or purges,
,of North Korean officials are not uncommon.
,But he says the level of publicity in this case is unusual.
,"In the past, hundreds or maybe even thousands
,of high level officials have been purged.
,Some of them executed.
,Some of them were sent to exile or prison.
,However, with very few exceptions in most areas,
,purges have always been fixed.
,Unlike say the Soviet Union under Stalin,
,when they remove the high level official,
,they usually did not make it public.
,When they did, it was never on such a scale."
,Leonid Petrov is a Korea expert
,with the Australian National University.
,He questions whether Jang Song Thaek
,was actually plotting to overthrow the government.
,"I think this has nothing to do with what really happened.
,Jang Song Thaek was a loyal member of Kim's regime.
,He was appointed by Kim Jong Il to supervise his son.
,Jang Song Thaek was doing everything possible
,to promote Kim Jong Un's image."
,Leonid Petrov says a personal or family dispute
,could have led to the execution.
,But he says it is also clear
,that Mr. Kim considered his uncle a threat.
,And he says the North Korean leader felt the need
,to send a message that he is in complete control.
,"The elites are scared to death at the moment.
,And the grassroots population of North Korea
,also gets the message that it is Kim Jong Un
,who is in the driving seat.
,They must follow his orders,
,and there's simply no alternative
,or any place for dissent in North Korea."
,Mr. Jang was quietly ousted from power not once,
,but two times under the former North Korean leader.
,But he regained power with the help of his wife Kim Kyong Hui,
,the sister of the former leader.
,Much of North Korea's central leadership
,is from the rule of Kim Jong Il.
,Many officials are in their 60s or 70s.
,This has led some observers to debate the level
,of their support for 30-year-old Kim Jong Un.
,Mr. Kim took power two years ago.
,Since then,
,he has replaced more than 40 percent of high level officials,
,and built his rule with a younger generation loyal to him.
,There were no signs of unrest in North Korea following the execution.
,But the South Korean Defense Ministry said
,it was closely watching the North Korean military
,for aggressive movements.
,On Friday, the office of South Korea's president
,held a national security meeting
,to discuss the situation on the Korean peninsula.
,A Unification Ministry official said
,South Korea is watching the events with concern.

,A special advisory group in the United States
,is urging President Barack Obama to make changes
,to the government's surveillance programs.
,The group offered its suggestions
,in a report released this week.
,Mr. Obama ordered the report
,on the intelligence gathering activities
,earlier this year.
,The order followed information leaks from Edward Snowden,
,a former National Security Agency contract worker.
,The leaks created a huge problem
,for the NSA and the president.
,They also added to public knowledge
,about government information gathering,
,including the collection of data
,from telephone calls and activities on the Internet.
,The surveillance programs are operating
,under U.S. congressional approval.
,They have been amended at different times,
,and are under the supervision of a special court.
,Mr. Obama has described the programs
,as important to keeping Americans safe.
,But he has called for more "self-restraint" by the NSA.
,In its report, the Review Group on Intelligence
,and Communications Technologies proposes 46 changes.
,One is to end the government's storage of "metadata"
,of the telephone records of Americans.
,The report proposes that private companies
,or a non-government agency keep the records instead, not the NSA.
,Another proposal is to require a court to approve
,individual searches of phone and Internet data records.
,The report also proposes limits on the NSA's power
,to study known targets of counter terrorism surveillance
,after they enter the United States.
,The report is calling for a new process to identify
,"uses and limits of surveillance
,on foreign leaders and in foreign nations."
,It says decisions should consider whether other methods
,or targets of collection could provide needed information.
,The review group met with President Obama on Wednesday
,after sending him their report last week.
,Press secretary Jay Carney said President Obama
,plans to study the document over the holidays.
,He will speak to the nation about it next month
,after a separate government investigation is completed.
,"The president has been clear
,that even as we review our efforts
,and make some changes in how we do things,
,we will not harm our ability to face those threats.
,That is, his number one obligation as commander-in-chief."
,The official US position on Edward Snowden remains unchanged.
,The Obama administration says he should return
,to the United States to face criminal charges.
,It disagrees with suggestions that he receive a pardon
,to prevent him from releasing additional information.
,Earlier this week a federal court ruled
,that secretly collecting the telephone records of Americans
,is likely unconstitutional.
,Mr. Obama also faced pressure from leaders of high-tech companies.
,Reports said they urged him to make aggressive reforms,
,and expressed concern about damage to the United States' image
,and business interests overseas.
,The "60 Minutes" television program recently spoke
,with the head of the NSA, Keith Alexander.
,He denied that the agency is collecting e-mails
,or listening to the phone calls of Americans.
,He said the NSA's job is foreign intelligence.

,The government of South Sudan
,has told its soldiers
,to stop fighting government opponents.
,The move is part of an effort to end violence
,that began after a dispute
,between the country's president
,and former vice-president.
,The government's announcement
,came after leaders of other countries
,in the area met to urge the two sides
,to stop the violence.
,A spokesman for South Sudan's Foreign Ministry
,told VOA on Friday
,that the government's cease-fire
,will begin immediately.
,It gave the government's opponents three days
,to answer the call for a cease-fire.
,Violence began in the capital Juba
,on December 15th
,and quickly spread across the country
,after a dispute between President Salva Kiir
,and former vice president Riek Machar --
,his main political competitor.
,In July, Mr. Kiir dismissed his cabinet,
,including Mr. Machar.
,Tensions had been rising since then,
,but fighting began
,only when Mr. Kiir accused Mr. Machar
,of planning to overthrow the government.
,Mr. Machar denied the claim.
,The fighting surprised many observers.
,From the time South Sudan became an independent country in 2011,
,many feared that the new country
,would be at war with Sudan,
,the country from which it won independence.
,Instead, South Sudan is at war with itself.
,The fighting has divided the military in some areas,
,and has increased ethnic tensions.
,Some members of President Kiir's Dinka ethnic group
,have been fighting with Mr. Machar's ethnic group -- the Nuer.
,The foreign ministry said
,government soldiers have taken control of Malakal
, -- the capital of Upper Nile state
,-- after days of fierce battles.
,Leaders of East African countries meeting in Nairobi on Friday
,welcomed the South Sudanese government's decision to end the fighting.
,They called on Mr. Machar and others to do the same.
,Both Mr. Machar and Mr. Kiir have agreed to meet.
,But the government has rejected Mr. Machar's demands
,that the government release his supporters,
,who were jailed in the early days of the crisis.
,At the meeting in Nairobi,
,Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said
,the detained political leaders
,should be included in talks to end the crisis.
,"The detainees are part of South Sudan's leadership
,and as such are part of the solution.
,South Sudan's legal system must process them
,as it should while they are treated humanely
,and quickly enabled to be an integral part of the dialogue
,that will solve the underlying political problems
,that have brought us to this unfortunate crisis."
,Mr. Kenyatta also urged the African Union,
,the United Nations and other countries
,to promise more support for South Sudan.
,And he said leaders of other East African nations
,would not accept what he called
,the "unconstitutional overthrow"
,of South Sudan's democratically-elected government.
,Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn says
,he supports Mr. Kiir.
,"It should be underscored
,that the legitimate government of South Sudan
,under President Salva Kiir Mayardit
,is the duly elected representative of the people of South Sudan
,and it has every responsibility
,to restore peace and stability throughout the country."
,The United Nations estimates more than 1,000 people
,have been killed in violence across the country
,since the middle of December.
,It says more than 50,000 people have fled to UN bases.
,The UN hopes to send more peacekeepers
,to the country within a few days.
,UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said
,the crisis cannot be ended using troops.
,East African leaders called on all sides
,in the conflict to meet before the end of the year.

,Stock prices in the United States
,and Japan rose sharply in 2013.
,The rising prices were evidence of investors
,welcoming efforts to push down interest rates.
,Low interest rates help
,to reduce the cost of homes,
,equipment and other goods.
,The leading measure of Japanese stock prices
,was up 57 percent last year.
,That was the best performance
,for Japan's Nikkei Index in many years.
,In the United States, another stock index,
,the S&P 500, rose almost 30 percent in 2013.
,Another measure of stocks,
,the NASDAQ Composite Index, rose 38 percent.
,The share prices were up, in part,
,because of actions by the US and Japanese central banks.
,The US Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates
,to almost zero a few years ago.
,More recently, the Federal Reserve has been working
,to push down long-term interest rates.
,The central bank has been buying billions of dollars'
,worth of bonds and other government securities.
,The bank recently announced it would reduce that program
,because the economy no longer needs so much help.
,Nick Ventura is with Ventura Wealth Management,
,a financial investment company in New Jersey.
,He calls some of the actions by central banks
,a "global gamble" that has worked, at least so far.
,In 2013, the American economy grew and housing prices rose.
,At the same time, the jobless rate fell a little.
,Mr. Ventura says the improving economy
,meant fewer wild movements in stock prices,
,and fewer worried investors.
,"Every time that there was the slightest pullback
,in stock prices it was rewarded with a fresh round of buying.
,So there is a growing confidence in the U.S. recovery
,and I think that's what really perked up the U.S. economy."
,Experts say they saw improvements in consumer
,and investor confidence toward the end of last year.
,That sense of trust seems to be making investors
,more willing to take small risks by purchasing shares of stock.
,The Wall Street Journal says investors
,are simply looking for stocks with low prices
,and a likelihood of strong earnings.
,Another newspaper, The Financial Times,
,reports that investments said to offer safety
,in troubled economic times saw fewer buyers.
,These investments include gold and government bonds.
,Some experts predict stock prices will continue to climb in 2014,
,but at a slower rate than last year.
,Over in Turkey, a deepening political crisis
,is affecting the country's stock market.
,By the end of 2013,
,Turkey's stock market had fallen more than 20 percent,
,while the value of Turkish money hit new lows.
,Concerns are growing about the effects of the power struggle
,between the government and the judiciary.
,More than 20 people, including state officials,
,have been arrested on corruption charges.
,Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismisses the investigation
,as part of a plot to bring down his government.
,Last week, protesters gathered in several cities
,to demand the resignation of the prime minister.
,Thousands of supporters of Mr. Erdogan held separate demonstrations.

,like we did when spring began
,wake me up when september ends
,here comes the rain again
,falling from the stars
,drenched in my pain again
,becoming who we are
,as my memory rests
,but never forgets what I lost
,wake me up when september ends
,
,Summer has come and passed
,The innocent can never last
,wake me up when september ends
,like my father's come to pass
,twenty years has gone so fast
,wake me up when september ends
,wake me up when september ends
,wake me up when september ends

,A thousand years, a thousand more,
,A thousand times a million doors to eternity
,I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
,An endless turning stairway climbs
,To a tower of souls
,If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars,
,The towers rise to numberless floors in space
,I could shed another million tears, a million breaths,
,A million names but only one truth to face
,
,A million roads, a million fears
,A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
,I could speak a million lies, a million songs,
,A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
,But if there was a single truth, a single light
,A single thought, a singular touch of grace
,Then following this single point , this single flame,
,The single haunted memory of your face
,
,I still love you
,I still want you
,A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
,Like galaxies in my head
,
,I may be numberless, I may be innocent
,I may know many things, I may be ignorant
,Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
,Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
,I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
,Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
,Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
,I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
,I still love you
,I still want you
,A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
,Like galaxies in my head
,
,On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
,Eternities still unsaid
,Till you love me

,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun,
,and her kisses were warmer than spring.
,But the Dornishman's blade was made of black steel,
,and its kiss was a terrible thing.
,The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed,
,in a voice that was sweet as a peach.
,But the Dornishman's blade has a song of its own,
,and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.
,As he lay on the gorund with darkness around,
,and the taste of his blood on his tongue.
,His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer,
,and he smiled and he laughed and he sung.
,"Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done.
,The Dornishman's taken my life.
,But what does it matter for all men must die,
,and I have tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
,feeling used
,but I'm
,still missing you
,and I can't
,see the end of this
,just wanna feel your kiss
,against my lips

,you ever wonder what we coulda been?
,you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
,sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
,i know that i control my thoughts, and i should stop reminiscing
,but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,when love and trust are gone
,i guess this is moving on
,everyone i do right does me wrong
,so every lonely night, i sing this song
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put
,nobody else above you
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i want you
,you want her, you need her
,and i'll never be her
,all alone i watch you watch her
,like she‘s the only girl you've ever seen
,you don't care u never did
,you don't give a damn about me
,yeah all alone i watch you watch her
,she's the only thing you've ever seen
,how is it you never notice
,that you are slowly killing me
,i hate you i love you
,i hate that i love you
,don't want to, but i can't put

,
,Trop de bruits
,Pour trop de nuit qui pensent
,Quand valse l'absence
,Dans ce bal
,
,Ton silence est un cri qui fait mal
,
,Je devine
,Ton visage sur les ombres
,Les souvenirs sombrent
,M'assassinent

,Qui signent ma croix
,la douleur s'impose
,Mais je n'ose pas
,Manquer de toi
,Dans mes nuits
,Dans la pluie

,Sur mes rêves exangues
,Drôle danse

,Au-dessus
,De ton corps défendu
,Mon amour pendu
,Se balance
,
,Je dors sur des roses
,Qui signent ma croix
,La douleur s'impose
,mais je n'ose pas
,Effleurer les choses
,Ecloses sans toi
,Oh! ma rose
,Ne fane pas
,je manque de toi
,Dans mes nuits
,Dans la pluie
,Dans les rires
,Dans le pire
,De ma vie
,
,Je hais les roses
,Autant que mes sanglots
,La vie s'impose
,Je crois à nouveau
,A mes rêve défunts
,je veux enfin
,Oser la fièvre
,Du parfum
,Des roses
,
,The emptiness that we confess In the dimmest hour of day.
,In the common town, they make a sound Like the low, sad moan of prey.
,The bitter taste, the hidden face Of the lost forgotten child.
,The darkest need, The slowest speed, The pattern reconciled.
,These photographs mean nothing To the poison that they take.
,Before a moment's glory The light begins to fade.
,The outward cost Of all we've lost As we looked the other way.
,We've paid the price for this cruel device Till we have nothing left to pay.
,The river goes where the current flows The lightning must destroy.
,Events conspire to set a fire With the methods we employ.
,These dead men walk on water A cold blood runs through their veins.
,The angry river rises As we step into the rain.
,These photographs mean nothing To the poison that they take The angry river rises As we step into the rain.

,I will scream it out into the night
,I'll shout it from the rooftops and I swear I won't stop
,'Til you hear this love fill up the sky

,If we could drive the words we say
,Every single line could lead the way
,With the speed of light here on our side

,Can't afford to lose velocity
,When you're going places never seen
,With the speed of light here on our side
,We're chasing time, chasing time

,And we hope see all of you in next year, in 2017
,The club isn't the best place to find a lover
,So the bar is where I go
,Me and my friends at the table doing shots
,Drinking faster and then we talk slow
,You come over and start up a conversation with just me
,And trust me I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
,
,Girl, you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
,Boy, let's not talk too much

,
,One week in we let the story begin
,We're going out on our first date
,But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
,Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
,We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
,And how your family is doin' okay
,And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
,Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

,Where the sun is shining
, (Sun is shining)
,Where those everyday worries fade away
,I need to find an island
,Where’s the path to run
,If you want to get away us more than science just about given up
,What’s the deal with us
,The only thing I needed to leave behind
,The last I have
,Should I believe the fear

,And will not pay the price
,For running clear of my hotel
,Instead to beautiful paradise
,I need to find an island
, (Find an island)
,When sun is shining
, (Sun is shining)
,Where the birds sing the sweetest melodies
,I need to find an island

,I'm the one who's feeling lost right now
,Now you want me to forget every little thing you said
,but there is something left in my head
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long
,But I'm not the man your heart is missing

,Now you wanna say goodbye to me
,Love is one big illusion I should try to forget
,but there is something left in my head
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long
,But I'm not the man your heart is missing
,That's why you go away I know
,Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere
,Don't know which way to go
,There ain't so much to say now between us
,There ain't so much for you
,There ain't so much for me anymore
,Chorus:I won't forget the way you're kissing
,The feeling's so strong were lasting for so long

,That's why you go away I know
,That's why you go away I know
,
,Nothing wrong with going off in a daydream
,In a daydream
,Nothing broken in a hopeless sky
,Never wonder, just go under and set free
,Can you set free
,All the hope that you can't hold inside?
,It's safe to say that I'm...
,Swimming in a deep devotion
,Didn't heed the warning signs
,Threw the flares into the ocean
,Gave them to the waves this time
,
,New horizon, let us lie in a daydream
,In a daydream
,On your dark side there's a holy light
,When it's over, pull it closer and set free
,Can you set free
,All the hope that you can't hold inside?
,It fades away and I'm...
,Swimming in a deep devotion
,Didn't heed the warning signs
,Threw the flares into the ocean
,Gave them to the waves this time

,Like felius domesticum
,
,It's of a girl, a real girl
,I'm calling by her real name
,
,And thus began
,A summer camp sonnet
,She saw a boy who would soon be
,A bee in her teenage bonnet
,Nina and her very long hair
,Held a torch that got her nowhere
,She hit him with a thunderbolt smile
,Every thing she had she threw
,Every dress and every shoe
,Nina and her very long hair
,Held a torch that got her nowhere
,As hard as she tried
,He never looked twice
,He never did see the light,
,And end the plight of Nina
,
,Sometimes a film, comes over me,
,Like a cold cup of tea
,And I forget, what I was set
,To snag and bag, grab and seize
,
,At seventeen
,She was still reeling
,She went to camp
,With a comb and a tent
,And that same old feeling
,Nina and her very long hair
,Held a torch that got her nowhere
,She hit him with a thunderbolt smile
,Every thing she had she threw
,Every dress and every shoe
,Nina and her very long hair
,Held a torch that got her nowhere
,As hard as she tried
,He never looked twice
,He never did see the light,
,And end the plight of Nina
,
,And so she snipped,
,She cut and she clipped
,Enough to thatch a cottage roof
,And once she'd preened,
,She glowed and she gleamed
,Off she set to make him swoon

,They won't see through my disguise
,Right here behind my eyes
,Replaying in my mind
,I feel like there is no better place than right by your side

,This boy's too young to be singin' the blues.
,So goodbye yellow brick road,
,Where the dogs of society howl.
,You can't plant me in your pent-house.
,I'm goin' back to my plough,
,Back to the howling old owl in the woods
,Hunting the horny back toad
,Oh I've finally decided my future lies
,Beyond the yellow brick road
,What do you think you'll do then.
,I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
,It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
,To set you on your feet again.
,Maybe you'll get a replacement.
,There's plenty like me to be found
,Mongrels who ain't got a penny.
,Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
,So goodbye yellow brick road,
,Where the dogs of society howl.
,You can't plant me in your pent-house.
,I'm goin' back to my plough,
,Back to the howling old owl in the woods.
,Hunting the horny back toad
,Oh I've finally decided my future lies
,Beyond the yellow brick road
,Well I'm so above you
,And it's plain to see
,But I came to love you anyway
,So you tore my heart out
,And I don't mind bleeding
,Any old time to keep me waiting
,Waiting, waiting

,Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting

,And I should've done you just the same
,But I came to love you
,Am I want to flee

Some mother's son lies in a field
Someone has killed some mother's son today
Head blown up by some soldier's gun
While all the mothers stand and wait
Some mother's son ain't coming home today
Some mothers son ain't got no grave
Two soldiers fighting in a trench
One soldier glances up to see the sun
And dreams of games he played when he was young
And then his friend calls out his name
It stops his dream and as he turns his head
A second later he is dead
Some mother's son lies in a field
Back home they put his picture in a frame
But all dead soldiers look the same
While all the parents stand and wait
To meet their children coming home from school
Some mother's son is lying dead
Somewhere someone is crying
Someone is trying to be so brave
But still the world keeps turning
Though all the children have gone away
Some mother's son lies in a field
But in his mother's eyes he looks the same
As on the day he went away
They put his picture on the wall
They put flowers in the picture frame
Some mothers memory remains

Well mr. churchill says, mr. churchill says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
Mr. beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin
And all the garden gates
And empty cans are gonna make us win
We shall defend our island
On the land and on the sea
We shall fight them on the beaches
On the hills and in the fields
We shall fight them in the streets
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few
'cos they have made our british empire
A better place for me and you
And this was their finest hour
Well mr. montgomery says
And mr. mountbatten says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
As vera lynn would say
We'll meet again someday
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end
Did you hear that plane flying overhead
There's a house an fire and there's someone lying dead
We gotta clean up the streets
And get me back on my feet
Because we wanna be free
Do your worst and we'll do our best
We're gonna win the way that mr. churchill says
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! well mr. churchill says
We gotta hold up our chins
We gotta show some courage and some discipline
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors
And keep right on till the end of the war

,So unsteady on your feet
,But you have the strength inside you
,Of the trees, the rooks, the beach

,Each day you find so hard
,Waiting for another

,穿上那件未见过太阳的新衣裳
,我想吉母她和我一样也这样希望
,
,我要走了米尔大哥
,你也快走快把以前忘了
,会再见的吉姆餐厅
,你先上了那辆离开时间的车
,别再见了米尔大哥回不去的时光乐土
,挥不去的都写满面孔和青春一起褪落
,沉睡吧吉姆餐厅沉睡呀儿时乐土
,再也不会有谁牵绊着你踏上远方的路
,沉睡吧吉姆餐厅沉睡呀不用牵挂
,再也不会有谁让你感到钻心的痛苦

,Watching how the stars are fading into the silver rain
,Just like her eyes were expecting sparking diamond rings
,Barricades against herself and
,Standing in the shades
,To be the one she never ever want to be
,Speak the words of love
,If it could take the pain away
,You could be the greatest lovers without any chains
,Don't come to her with roses
,No flowers, no wedding dresses
,Just say: my life is yours to take
,Only if you stay
,
,Smiling like the summer flowers
,Reminds you of a child
,You've been shreding all your tears
,For unwritten fairy tails
,Across the ocean and to across the universe
,We should live our life as a dream in someone else's dream
,So speak the words of hate
,But still those memory remains
,Rising sand on the silent sea
,Shows we are so incomplete
,Don't come to me with your song
,It's not a kiss of the eternal
,I guess i'll never see you again

,Yeah, when I was only 17,
,I could hear the angels whispering
,So I droned into the words and wandered aimlessly about
,Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
,It turned out to be the howling of a dog
,Or a wolf to be exact, the sound sent shivers down my back
,But I was drawn into the pack and before long
,They allowed me to join in and sing their song
,So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah
,We would gladly get our fill
,Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
,And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
,For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah
,And my thoughts, they surely were
,Turned to instinct and obedience to God.
,
,
,You can wear your fur
,like a river on fire
,But you better be sure
,if you're makin' God a liar
,I'm a rattlesnake, Babe,
,I'm like fuel on fire
,So if you're gonna' get made,
,Don't be afraid of what you've learned
,On the day that I turned 23,
,I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
,When suddenly a girl with skin the color of a pearl
,She wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
,She was listenin' for the angels just like me
,So I stood and looked about
,I brushed the leaves off of my snout
,And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
,You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
,So I took her by the arm
,We settled down upon a farm
,And raised our children up as gently as you please.
,
,And now my fur has turned to skin
,And I've been quickly ushered in
,To a world that I confess I do not know
,But I still dream of running careless through the snow
,An' through the howlin' winds that blow,
,Across the ancient distant flow,
,It fill our bodies up like water till we know.
,
,You can wear your fur
,Like a river on fire
,But you better be sure
,If you're makin' God a liar

Do you remember when you were young
Chasing clouds down the rivers
Catching birds in the sun
You have surrendered life's better hours
In the deep lies your freedom
In the stars is your home
As we gather to see you go
Flowers scatter to let you know
Sons of the mountains cry in the vials
Warm and tender in her arms
So you'll stay though you're gone
As we gather to say goodbye
Until we see your face again
But seasons come you're going soon
Everybody leaves in the end
Do you remember, do you remember
No one way, no one can ever walk like you again
All the names left behind
Are standing mirrors of your eyes
No one will, not one name
Shall replace the wars that came
Held you tight, we held you tight
Everybody leaves in the end
Do you remember?

,I run, yeah I run, but you follow, oh, oh
,And when I dream, it's not of you
,I ride the dogs on the lake, under the lights
,A frozen breeze
,Wanna be there, could’ve been more
,Suddenly thought, don’t change, don’t change
,Wanna be there, could’ve been more
,Help me to find, won’t you Wray for my release
,Chorus:
,And when I dream, it’s not of you, oh
,And when I call, I wonder, I do
,I run, yeah I run, but you follow,
,Drop to my knees but you haunt me more
,And when I dream, it’s not of you
,What do you need to claim a victory?
,Not every right that I leave on
,Does it have an end that you see?
,O-oh-oh
,Chorus:
,And when I dream, it’s not of you, oh
,And when I call, I wonder, I do
,I run, yeah I run, but you follow,
,Drop to my knees but you haunt me more
,And when I dream, it’s not of you

,You live in a cave, one made of drapes
,Your hint? of perfume from your personal maid
,Whose scrubs make her arms look too big for her frame
,For the life of me I can't remember her name
,I'm praying to speak, accept myself
,And most use prayers to keep a good health
,You'll never die, you'll never die
,I live in a fog, one that's foremade
,While my physical body's turning in my grave
,The spirit's forgiven, building in your brain
,But it doesn't know how
,I reach my arm across the bed and hold your hand
,The angel of state can't wait to seize all your land
,You'll never die, you'll never die
,You weren't there when I needed
,You are gone, you're going under
,You'll never die, you'll never die

,Harmoni sing with a girl soft in the face
,Just like the old days
,Golden sea plane,dollar, tell skin to tape in what a bargain turn up in a yellow night
,Found oysters on the beach
,I'm undressed from the waist.
,My girl says that all good rain promises
,To give life to the seeds, seeds
,Live, in the moment,never count on longevity
,Please Ribbons showing very plainly on her skinok, i want in
,Heels over headwith her, never mind the taste my lovely space case
,Legs bruised up from the beast

,They look so green
,The horizon is the place
,That you always dream
,We shoot the nest
,Like a bolt from a gun
,You're tapping on the door
,To the beat of the drum
,Hold it up  And steer it up  This game is over

,Fall through the crowd, and disappear
,In the teenage magazines, and shopping malls
,Walk through the wildlife for miles, and miles
,Hold my breath and count a hundred and ten
,And back up the hill to start again
,Watching spiders on the bedroom ceiling
,They got big plans, so they're not breathing
,Feel the frisson of tomorrow today
,I could get up but it won't go away
,Do nothing to impress my friends
,Just rub my eyes for hours on end
,Oh England, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool
,I need someone to tell me
,Everything'll be alright
,I need someone who'll hold me
,When the day turns to night
,I need someone who loves me
,More than you do
,Oh we say that's not true
,And you and me in line as double bill
,Surrogate heroes on TV and films
,I've never met anyone like you
,I've never done the things you like to do
,On the way to heaven in a comedy car
,The new stars of melancholia
,There's nothing to get angry about

,I've got a feeling that nobody's sold
,I've got a feeling that I should let myself go, go, go

When it was dark
I was a question mark
Becoming the gunship
I had a heart
But it was torn apart
Now I'm the gunship
Run away cannonball
Bombs away
You don't wanna be here
When I hit 'em all
And like the wealth
That doesn't know itself
I am a bird that doesn't fly
I lost desire
To hold my fire
I am the gunship
Run away cannonball
Bombs away
You don't wanna be here
When I hit 'em all
When it was dark
I was question mark
Becoming the gunship
I couldn't stop
Had no control to turn it off
I was the gunship
I am the gunship
Will be the gunship
Becoming the gunship

,But I need to live my own truth
,I wanna feel it all brand new
,I found a little something from Miss Angelou
,
,This path is difficult we travel on
,Knowing when it’s time to move along
,No we can’t stay in the same place
,Where the light fades away
,A little every day
,Take the good and hold it near to you
,And let go of all the burdens you
,No we can’t stay in the same place
,Yeh it’s brand new oh it’s gonna be ok

,Desert air the hot despair of summer time
,Dreams that kept you warm through all those winter nights

, It starts to rain and we
, We're the broken beauties
, Blindfolded minds collide and we fall
,
, When the curtain drops
, Our touch is just a touch
, Not like in the movies
, Our story's after the end
,

, Perfect pretenders
, We're falling head over heels
, For something that ain't real
, It could never be us, eh
, Just you and I

, Memories in photos
, Too easy to rewrite
, Left as lonely shadows
, Holding each other tight and we fall

,With this ring I take my bride to be,
,And promise that I will be faithful to you,
,Until you are taken from me.
,But we may not arrive,
,To our Holy Father at the same time.
,But my darling, dear, don't be afraid.
,Cause I'll hold you near,
,And in His presence you'll forever be made whole.
,No, this is not the end.
,It is where all joy begins in this world.

,On my life, I won't abandon you.
,I will be waiting at your side.
,Until the good Lord comes, takes you home,
,You'll not be alone.

,Then we were so young
,Brother gather arm
,As I announce my reckon sound
,I am sorry for the way I treated you

,But I will prove to you that I am the same
,Reality
,I finally see the angle
,(Do you feel the same)

,The club isn't the best place to find a lover
,So the bar is where I go
,Me and my friends at the table doing shots
,Drinking faster and then we talk slow
,You come over and start up a conversation with just me
,And trust me I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop, Put Van The Man on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Where were you in sixty-eight?
In sixty-eight, Julie was Johnnie's date
Two kids growin' together
Livin' each day as if time was slippin' away
Oh, they were just sixteen
And their love a teenage dream
They passed the time, they crossed the line
The line that ran between
Julie and Johnnie, now you've made it
But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong
'Cause you're all part of the sixteens
Suzie and Davey got to make the big time
Maybe they can put it all together
In a show that lasts forever
Oh, they would walk the strip at nights
And dream they saw their name in lights
On Desolation Boulevard
They'll light the faded light
Suzie and Davey, you can make it
But life goes on, you know it ain't easy
You've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know, you know it ain't easy
You know you'll never go wrong
'Cause you're all part of the sixteens
So where were you in sixty-eight?
When Bobby and Billy thought
That sixty-eight was out of date
They took the flowers from their hair
And tried to make us all aware
Too bad, too late
So they lived from day to day
And tried to do it all their way
But sixty-eight was sixty-eight
No matter what they say
Bobby and Billy, maybe you'll make it one day

Last time in my mind
Lets me know that I see only option.
If I want what you want, 
They hurt … but only on the outside
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
Towards silence, she has a feeling 
Of the man I felt too deceitful.. faithless
Bright side of my mind
Lets me know that is the only option.
I’ll want, what I want, 
It will hurt now, but only on the inside!
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
If I fall, can at least I fall
Towards silence, she has a feeling 
Of the man I felt too deceitful.. faithless

decide in life 
what’s worth the pain and regret
for leaving light in spaces
best left unlit
cause
truth only hurts
claim just a touch
and I’m in deep
admit it’s wrong
that spite only drives me more
in the end
are we stable?
(couldn’t feel I’m more alone in this)
cause I’m falling
(the truth’s awful)
believe a standard sets
me apart from all I am
cleave into what stands for 
love of lust spent
cause
truth only hurts
claim just a touch
and I’m in deep
admit it’s wrong
that spite only drives me more
in the end
are we stable?
(couldn’t feel I’m more alone in this)
cause I’m falling

The summer's good for tulips,
 Though pansies disagree.
 They find the heat most distasteful,
 And humidity far too grim to stand up tall
 And bargain with the bees.
 They prefer to droop and mope
 And wait for autumn's breeze.
 
 The autumn's good for pumpkins,
 Though apples don't approve.
 The trees that they've been living on
 now forces them to move,
 And rudely lets them to fall
 and sends them quick to their demise
 Without so much a bon voyage or even a goodbye.
 
 The winter's good for penguins,
 Though brown bears must object.
 When talk comes to the joys of winter,
 They must interject,
 "Hibernating in the snow just isn't where it's at,
 because sleeping makes you skinny,
 and we bears like to be fat."
 
 The springtime is the season,
 Where everyone's a friend.
 Loneliness and desperation both come to an end.
 No matter how you died through winter,
 In spring you're born again,
 Your life might not be going good,
 But spring helps you to pretend.
Tim, wish you were born a girl,
 So I could've been your boyfriend.
 I know it's not possible now.
 I just never met a girl I like half as much as you.
 
 And we could lay around in bed, stay there all day,
 Or at least until the afternoon
 And I could make you spaghetti with tomato sauce
 With just a touch of oregano and a parsley stem.
 
 And then when you got sick,
 I could take the day off work.
 I could've made you chicken soup,
 And we could watch soap operas
 - oh, those TV dramas!
 I could catch your cold
 
 
 and you could take care of me.
 
 If I could've met you at school, or met you at work,
 It would have changed everything.
 
 Those years of losing, confusion and insecurity,
 They would have been shared,
 they would have been easier.
 
 Tim, wish you were born a girl,
 Tim, wish you were born a girl,
 So I could've been your fiancé.
 I'm not saying you can't be all these things for me,
 But it's just not the same because you're a man,
 and so am I.
When you come around
Everything else disappears
My ears disappear
When you come around
Everything else vanishes
Crowds slowly fade
When you come around
Everything evaporates
When you come around, around, around
On the news at night
They talk about the disappearances
They interview the people
Who were witnesses
Most are shocked, some don't care
When you come around
Everything else disappears
My mouth disappears
When you come around
Everything else vanishes
Birds have no heads
When you come around
Everything loses its legs
When you come around, around, around
On the news at night
They talk about the abnormalities
They interview the people
Who are authorities
Most are intrigued, some don't care
When you come around
When you are near
I feel so far away
From the person, 
I am alone
I feel like 
I'm jumping
On a trampoline, trampoline
When you come around
Everything else disappears
My eyes disappear
When you come around
Everything else vanishes
Sunlight swims away
When you come around
And even darkness won't stay
When you come around, around, around
Around, around, around
, Pardon me
, I didn't realize what's in your eyes
, My arms are open wide
, But I can't ever decide what I want to do
, I'm staring at the sky
, But I can't tell which way my thoughts are traveling
, I try to listen to your words
, But I can feel my head and it's unraveling
, Sometimes I no longer know
, What it means to care about things you want to do
, Everybody's living or they're dead
, And I'm still in my bed
, And I don't have a clue
, I won't lie and tell you it's alright
, I won't lie and tell you it's alright

,came  in  from  a  rainy  thursday
,on  the  avenue
,thought  i  heard  you  talking  softly
,i  turned  on  the  lights,the  tv
,and  the  radio
,still  i  can't  escape  the  ghost  of  you
,what  has  happened  to  it  all?
,crazy,some'd  say
,where  is  the  life  that  i  recognize?
,gone  away
,but  i  won't  cry  for  yesterday
,there's  an  ordinary  world
,somehow  i  have  to  find
,and  as  i  try  to  make  my  way
,to  the  ordinary  world
,i  will  learn  to  survive
,passion  or  coincidence
,once  prompted  you  to  say
,'pride  will  tear  us  both  apart'
,well  now  pride's  gone  out  the  window
,cross  the  rooftops
,run  away
,left  me  in  the  vacuum  of  my  heart
,what  is  happening  to  me?
,crazy,some'd  say
,where  is  my  friend  when  i  need  you  most?
,gone  away
,but  i  won't  cry  for  yesterday
,there's  an  ordinary  world
,somehow  i  have  to  find
,nd  as  i  try  to  make  my  way
,to  the  ordinary  world
,i  will  learn  to  survive
,papers  in  the  roadside
,tell  of  suffering  and  greed
,here  today,forgot  tomorrow
,ooh,here  besides  the  news
,of  holy  war  and  holy  need
,ours  is  just  a  little  sorrowed  talk
,and  i  don't  cry  for  yesterday
,there's  an  ordinary  world
,somehow  i  have  to  find
,and  as  i  try  to  make  my  way

I've gotta big big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on preakness
Never met a girl that likes to drink with horses
Knows her 
Chinese ballet
Must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze
A thing or two at night
Make me sick sick sick to kiss you and 
I think that 
I woud vomit
But I'll do that on mondays 
I don't have a work way
I like it when 
I bump you an accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lense
I'll hold you don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes 
I'm quiet. 
Hallelujah!
Sometimes 
I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, 
I know...Well 
I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares?
A trapeze is a bird cage even if it's empty and definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore
I've gotta big big big big heart beat, yeah
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age
To start our own peculiar ways
With good and friendly homes
Sometimes you're quiet, and sometimes 
I'm quiet, hallelujah
Sometimes 
I'm talkative, and sometimes you're not talkative, 
I know...Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me. 
Hallelujah!
Sometimes 
I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. 
Well, hello...
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you, would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feelin' in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Gotta crush, high
Thought I crushed all 
I couldCrushed all 
I can then 
I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop'
Cause stories of your brother make my crush high pop
And you couldn't really know, cause it's in my toes
And sometimes 
I wonder where that crush high go
Crush high then 
I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my dos and still feel ill
Communication's never been
 as easy as today
 and it would make me happy
 when you've gone so far away
 if you'd send me an e-mail
 that says "I love you"
 Send me an e-mail
 that says "I love you"
 Now time and distance
 melt away
 No digital delay
 And some things
 can be written down
 that we're too shy to say
 Send me an e-mail
 that says "I love you"
 Send me an e-mail
 that says "I love you"
 There may be other
 temptations in your life
 Don't want to add more
 complications to your life
 but I'm sending this e-mail
 to say "I love you"
 Now there's a ghost
 within this house
 You're haunting me tonight
 I'm looking at some photographs
 and thinking that I might
 jump on a plane
 and surprise you where
 you are
 but do you want me there?
 I'm so insecure
 but one thing would make me sure
 if you'd
 send me an e-mail
 that says "I love you"
 Send me an e-mail
 that says "I love You"

,長長的路上我想我們是朋友
,如果有期待我想最好是不說
,你總是微笑的你總是不開口
,世界被你　掌握
,月亮繞地球地球繞著太陽走
,我以為世界是座寧靜的宇宙
,今晚的天空有一顆流星劃過
,在預言著　什麼
,在無聲之中你拉起了我的手
,我怎麼感覺整個黑夜在震動
,耳朵裡我聽到了心跳的節奏
,星星在閃爍
,你怎麼說
,你心中一定有座濃霧的湖泊
,任憑月光再皎潔照也照不透
,你眼中閃爍湖面無邊的溫柔
,那波光在　誘惑
,你會怎麼說
,你已經有他就不應該再有我
,世界的純真此刻為你有迷惑
,我想我應該輕輕放開你的手
,我卻沒有力氣這麼做

,其实仍然怀念你  温馨的爱
,在天色一黑会来到梦内
,其实逐渐寂寞  还未有替代
,仍是爱你  期望你会又不说自来
,谁人明白我  我将空虚掩盖
,让悲伤忧郁痴情沉默到现在
,明白现实是现实  明白总有意外
,谁料我已永不懂再别爱
,你决心不再伴我吗
,深宵再勾起可否旧情复再
,难道你觉得不算什么
,知否我今天再次悄悄独自看海

,东打一下西戳一下
,动物未必需要尖牙
,示爱的方法有礼貌或是我管它
,要将情人一口吞下
,还要显得温文尔雅
,螳螂委屈的展示旧伤疤
,求偶时候一惊一乍
,因为害怕时常倒挂
,走投无路的情况下舍弃了尾巴
,如果不能将它同化就寄生于它 大不了一同腐化
,努力进化 笑动物世界都太假
,祖先 已磨去爪牙
,相爱相杀 一定有更好的办法
,攀比一下 谁先跪下
,不再进化 动物世界里都太傻
,为情表现到浮夸
,得到了你就该丢下 人性来不及粉刷
,所以啊 人总患孤寡
,麋鹿本来约在树下
,说好一起浪迹天涯
,系上铃铛还在往那个方向挣扎
,如果有只豺狼它英勇披上婚纱 同伴笑他读过童话
,别再进化 别让动物世界太假
,我们 该露出爪牙
,相爱相杀 别再想更好的办法
,优胜劣汰 自舔伤疤
,假装进化 拼命想和动物有差
,玩一出高贵优雅
,在人们腐烂的欲望下 兽性来不及抹杀
,算了吧 懒得去挣扎
,人类用沙 想捏出梦里通天塔
,为贪念不惜代价
,驾驭着昂贵的木马 巢穴一层层叠加
,最后啊 却一丝不挂    别害怕 我们都孤寡

,反正现在的感情 都暧昧
,你大可不必为难 找般配
,付出过的人排队 谈体会
,趁年轻别害怕一个人睡
,可能是现在感情 太昂贵
,让付出真心的人 好狼狈
,还不如听首情歌 的机会 忘了谁
,感情像牛奶一杯 越甜越让人生畏
,都早有些防备 润色前的原味
,所以人们都拿起咖啡 把试探放在两人位
,距离感一对 就不必再赤裸相对
,反正现在的感情 都暧昧
,你大可不必为难 找般配
,付出过的人排队 谈体会
,弃之可惜 食而无味
,可能是现在感情 太珍贵
,让付出真心的人 好疲惫
,谁不曾用过卑微的词汇 想留住谁
,还贪恋着衣衫昂贵 却输给了廉价香水
,他先诱你入位 还刻意放低了分贝
,可感情越爱越妩媚 像烂掉的苹果一堆
,连基因都不对 还在意什么鱼腥味
,反正现在的感情 都暧昧
,你大可不必为难 找般配
,何必给自己沉迷 的机会
,不如用误会来结尾
,反正现在的我们 算暧昧
,我愿意给的感情 请浪费
,反正流过的眼泪 难收回
,就别再安慰
,看你入眠的侧脸 有多美
,和你丢下的一切 好匹配

,Whispered in my ear the things I'd like

,Give her all the love she gives to me
,Talk of better days that have yet to come
,Never felt this love from anyone
,She's not anyone

,Here I stand with head in hand
,Turn my face to the wall

,I can hear them laugh at me
,And I hear them say
,Hey, you've got to hide your love away
,Hey, you've got to hide your love away
,How could I even try
,Cuz I can never win
,Seeing them, hearing them
,In the state I'm in
,How could she say to me

,Can get myself some piece of mind
,You know it's getting hard to fly

  So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 Then go
 But my heart's going with you
 
 For the less you say
 The more I want to hear
 The less you give
 The more that I receive
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for
 Waiting for the next time that you're near me
 
 And I don't know why I want you
 And I don't know why I need you
 But I know you have my love
 So sliently you thrill me
 So silently you win me
 It's the silent type for me
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for
 The next time you are here
 
 So you're leaving
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting 
 For the next time that you come around
 
 So if you get to thinking
 The same as I've been dreaming
 Then let me know
 Just let me know
 
 When you leave me
 And you have to go
 Then you gotta go
 But my heart's going with you
 
 If you leave me
 And you have to go
 I'll be waiting for
 Waiting for the next time that you come
 
 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting
 I'll be waiting for the next time
 Waiting for the next time

 If you have to go
 I'll be waiting for you next time lover 
 Waiting for you next time

,When you fall asleep
,Before the end of the day
,You start to worry
,Like when the taxi comes
,To take you away
,When you're in no hurry
,Yet as our hair turns white
,All the stars still shine so bright above
,At least it's not the end of the world?
,Why...?
,We could live it large
,Coz we're only old once
,Let's make a difference
,Turn all the hate in the world
,Into a mocking bird
,Make it fly away
,Yet as our hair turns gray
,Everything is far from A. O.K.
,At least it's not the end of the world?
,No! No!
,At least it's not the end of the world?

,If you were good for me at all
,I wanna say, that everything’s fine
,But it’s not… but it’s not
,All the times you made me stay
,I see it all so clear today
,And I wish I could
,Turn back time… turn back time
,If I had a choice
,I’d leave all behind
,I’d make you leave my mind
,Leave my mind
,The things you had me do
,Everytime you knew I would
,I wanna say, that I was aware
,But I can’t… but I can’t

,And I feel like a fool
,I let myself down… let myself down
,And you begged me to trust you
,I wish I never did

,I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal.
,And the straw boss said (well bless my soul).
,You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
,Another day older and deeper in debt.
,Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go.
,I sold my soul to the company's store.
,If you see me coming better step aside.
,A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died.
,I've got one fist of iron, the other of steel.
,And if the right one don't get you then the left one will.
,You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
,Another day older and deeper in debt

Feel it breathing from the drums

,Laid out low, nothing to go
,Nowhere a way to meet
,
,Ive got a head full of drought,
,
,Down here, so faroff losing out
,Round here,

,Too way high off your street
,
,I can see like nothing else
,In me youre better than I wannabe

,Too strung up to sleep
,
,Wear me out, scream and shout
,Swear my times never cheap

,You've been looking for
,I wish I would have known that wasn't me
,Cause even after all this time I still wonder
,Why I can't move on
,Just the way you did so easily
,Don't wanna know
,What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
,If he's holding onto you so tight
,The way I did before

,I just hope you're lying next to somebody
,Who knows how to love you like me
,There must be a good reason that you're gone
,Every now and then I think you
,Might want me to come show up at your door
,But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
,Don't wanna know

,In the spring we made a boat
,out of feathers, out of bones.
,We set fire to our homes,
,walking barefoot in the snow.
,Distant rhythm of the drum
,as we drifted towards the storm.
,Baby lion lost his teeth,
,now they're swimming in the sea.
,
,Troubled spirits on my chest
,where they laid to rest.
,The birds all left my tall friend
,as your body hit the sand.
,Million stars up in the sky
,formed a tigers eye
,
,that looked down on my face,
,out of time and out of place.
,So hold on,
,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,
,Awaken by the sound
,of a screaming owl.
,Chasing leafs in the wind,
,going where we've never been.
,Said goodbye to you my friend,
,as the fire spread.
,All that's left are your bones
,that will soon sink like stones
,So hold on,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.

,Down by the river by the boats
,Where everybody goes to be alone
,Where you wont see any rising sun
,Down to the river we will run
,When by the water we drink to the dregs
,Look at the stones on the river bed
,I can tell from your eyes
,You've never been by the riverside

,To fall in the water just like a stone

,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.
,Дай чувства параллельно замирают.
,Дай забирают с собой слова мои пустые.
,Стены слышат капли в груди,в моей груди один.
,Не надо,забудем,давай уже не будем,эти ссоры,разговоры.
,A что по сути слова,коротать да твои,одиноко молчим,но по сердцу стучит словно адреналин.
,Не буду,но знаю,что где-то я скучаю.
,Но в мыслях понимаю,все слова твои пустые.
,Но просто отпусти,пойми что больше нет.
,Тусим,я давно тебя просил.
,Дай мне минуту с тобой,улетаю в даль я.

,Накидка на плече и мы с тобой в этот вечер,но я не понимаю,зачем нам эти встречи.
,Ведь мы разные,знаешь,я не люблю,ты скучаешь,раздели мы мечты,и ты об этом знаешь.
,Не буду,не надо встречаться даже взглядом.
,Отправил слова вулисон,забудем,что были рядом.
,Пусть уносят ветра о любви все слова твои,забудь и меня прости.

,
,this sense of indecision ain't what we had in mind

,we're losing all this daylight but soon the moon's gonna rise
,these final puzzle pieces, we tried but they're too tight
,but if we ease the pressure, I bet they'll fit just right
,
,sometimes it takes some patience, sometimes it works first try
,but I know that this is worth it, cause this dream's too strong to die

,I remember the times we spent together on those drives
,We had a million questions all about our lives
,And when we got to New York, everything felt right
,I wish you were here with me tonight
,
,I remember the days we spent together were not enough
,And it used to feel like dreamin' except we always woke up
,Never thought not having you here now, would hurt so much
,Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
,I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
,And every night I miss you
,I can just look up and know the stars are
,Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight
,
,I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
,And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
,I remember the car you were last seen in
,And the games we would play
,All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late
,I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus
,And how not to look back even if no one believes us
,When it hurt so bad sometimes not having you here
,I sing
,Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
,I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
,And every night I miss you
,I can just look up and know the stars are
,Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight
,
,I sing, tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
,I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
,And every night I miss you
,I can just look up and know the stars are
,Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight
,
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practice all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay cause I got no self esteem

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care 
Right? Yeah yeah yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem
,

,Watch you smile while you are sleeping
,While you ’re far away dreaming

Well I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before
She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore
* Chorus: Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before
I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days it seems
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word I took it all
Beneath the sign that said 'U-haul'
She left angels hangin round for more
Chorus
I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rockin' bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door!

,In the midst, I think of you and how it used to be

Find the colour
Sight and sound
A new exposure comes around
Anaesthetic for the mind
Hear the voice that soothes away the pain
Television, satellite,
Conversation running dry
Sending back another text
Holding on to words you might regret
You know you might regret
(Chorus)
Cause now i can see that i love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
Find the colour, find the colour
Looking for something new
A taste of life to pull you through
Defences down your feeling low
A change in feeling comes around again
Its coming round again
(Chorus)
Cause now i can see that i love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
So damn good
I read the papers yesterday
They say that the bubble boy's ok
Another day of rain to come
We're sitting back still waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
(Chorus)
Cause now i can see that i love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
Now i see that i love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good

, Can I give you a hand for your pinball heart?
, It's not heaven, but it's a start
, So lightly we tread
, You would call me up from your hospital bed
, Now we're doing it all, again

,But when I'm cold, cold
,In water rolled, salt
,I know that you’re with me
,And the way you will show
,And you’re with me wherever I go
,And you give me this feeling this everglow
,Oh, what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
,Yeah, I live for this feeling this everglow
,So if you love someone, you should let them know
,Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

,Please don't say we're done
,When I'm not finished
,I could give so much more
,Make you feel like never before
,Welcome, they said welcome to the floor
,It's been a while
,And you've found someone better
,But I've been waiting too long to give this up
,The more I see I understand

,Sometimes, I still need you
,Sometimes, I still need you
,Sometimes, I still need you
,
,And I was struggling to get in
,Left waiting outside your door
,I was sure
,You'd give me more
,No need to come to me
,When I can make it all the way to you
,You made it clear
,You weren't near
,Near enough for me
,Heart skipped a beat
,And when I caught it
,You were out of reach
,But I'm sure, I'm sure
,You've heard it before

,When i was young i'd listen to the radio
,waiting for my favorite songs
,When they played i'd sing along,
,it made me smile.
,Those were such happy times and not so long ago
,how i wondered where they'd gone.
,But they're back again just like a long lost friend
,all the songs i love so well.
,Every shalala every wo'wo
,still shines.
,Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
,that they're starting
,to sing so fine
,When they get to the part
,Where he's breaking her heart
,It can really make me cry
,just like before.
,It's yesterday once more.
,(shoobie do lang lang)
,Looking back on how it was in years gone by
,and the good times that I had
,makes today seem rather sad,
,so much has changed.
,It was songs of love that i would sing to them
,and i'd memorise each word.
,Those old melodies still sound so good to me
,as they melt the years away
,every shalala every wo'wo still shines
,every shing-a-ling-a-ling
,that they're startingto sing

,Every verse, every song, every feature I was on
,Better know that I abused it
,If I die before my time I’ll still be living through my music
,I cracked the industry open but still got this shit on lock

,Wish i could relive every single word
,We've taken different parts and traveled different roads
,I know we'll always end up on the same one
,When we're old
,When you're in the trenches and
,And you are under fire i will cover you
,If I was dying on my knees
,You'll be the one to rescue me
,And if you were drowned at sea
,I would give you my lungs so you could breathe

,Though we don't share the same blood

,We're living different lives
,Heaven only knows
,If I'm walking that could all our fingers in our toes
,Five years twenties

,you're laying waste to Halloween
,you fucked it friend,
,it's on it's head, it struck the street
,you're in Milwaukee, off your feet
,
,…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
,
,strayed above the highway aisle
,（jagged vacance, thick with ice）
,I could see for miles, miles, miles
,
,3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
,was where we learned to celebrate
,automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
,that night you played me Lip Parade
,not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
,saying nothing, that's enough for me
,
,…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
,
,hulled far from the highway aisle
,（jagged, vacance, thick with ice）
,I could see for miles, miles, miles
,
,Christmas night,
,it clutched the light, the hallow bright
,
,above my brother, I and tangled spines
,we smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
,now to know it in my memory:
,
,…and at once I knew I was not magnificent
,
,high above the highway aisle
,（jagged vacance, thick with ice）
,I could see for miles, miles, miles
,
,
,
,
,
,I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
,When we loose our winter coats in the spring
,Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
,That every time I see you my heart sings
,Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
,We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
,And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
,Oh I guess we had an expiration date
,So I won't say I love you, it's too late
,And oooooooooh
,Ooooohohoooooh
,And oooohoooooooh
,Ohoooohohohoooooh
,Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
,Shivering and shaking at the knees
,And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
,I didn't know the words in front of me
,In front of me, and oooooooh
,But I don't wanna know
,Who'll take you home?
,Who'll take you home?
,Who'll take you home?
,Hoooooome
,And oooooohhhhh
,And oooooohhhhh
,And oooooohhhhh
,Oooooooohooooohoohhhh
,Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
,The winter winds are colder on my own
,Maybe we will meet when we get older
,So I won't say I love you if you don't
,So I won't say I love you if you don't

,I've been here before
,But always hit the floor
,I've spent a lifetime running
,And I always get away
,But with you I'm feeling something
,That makes me want to stay
,I'm prepared for this
,I never shoot to miss
,But I feel like a storm is coming
,If I'm gonna make it through the day
,Then there's no more use in running
,This is something I gotta face
,If I risk it all
,Could you break my fall
,How do I live how do I breathe
,When you're not here I'm suffocating
,I want to feel love run through my blood
,Tell me is this where I give it all up
,For you I have to risk it all
,Cause the writing's on the wall
,A million shards of glass
,That haunt me from my past
,As the stars begin to gather
,And the light begins to fade
,When all hope begins to shatter
,Know that I won't be afraid
,If I risk it all
,Could you break my fall
,How do I live how do I breathe
,When you're not here I'm suffocating

,That's my little brother man he's only six years old

,That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
,He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
,I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein lied to
,Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
,you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
,I never knew my father neither
,he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
,I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
,so when I have a shitty day I drift away and put 'em on
,cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
,I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
,Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
,It's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
,See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
,My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
,But she don't know you like I know you Slim no one does
,She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
,You gotta call me man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
,Sincerely yours Stan -- P S

,I know you got my last two letters
,I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
,So this is my cassette I'm sending you I hope you hear it
,I'm in the car right now I'm doing 90 on the freeway
,Hey Slim I drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
,You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air of the Night
,about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
,but didn't then Phil saw it all then at a a show he found him
,That's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
,Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now I'm drowsy
,and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
,I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
,I love you Slim we coulda been together think about it
,You ruined it now I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
,And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
,I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
,See Slim {*screaming*} Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
,Hey Slim that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
,but I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up see I ain't like you
,cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
,Well gotta go I'm almost at the bridge now
,Oh shit I forgot how'm I supposed to send this shit out

,Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
,You said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
,Look I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
,and here's an autograph for your brother
,I wrote it on the Starter cap
,I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show I musta missed you
,Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
,But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
,I say that shit just clowning dogg
,c'mon - how fucked up is you
,You got some issues Stan I think you need some counseling
,to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
,And what's this shit about us meant to be together
,That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
,I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
,or maybe you just need to treat her better
,I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time
,before you hurt yourself I think that you'll be doin just fine
,if you relax a little I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
,why are you so mad Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
,I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
,I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
,Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
,and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
,and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
,Come to think about his name was it was you
,Damn!
,
,In the end I have faith
,Maybe this was meant to take
,A horoscope which we make
,A sole defense, the one you break
,You better should just fall asleep
,Try to see please
,Shots of cleaves
,If you come, I will stay
,You better should just fall asleep
,Try to see please
,Shots of cleaves
,If you want, I will stay
,Worst part of cold Sunday
,Is three car stops a sole away
,Too many bags, bike away
,You have me back towards the dream
,You better should just fall asleep
,Try to see please
,Shots of cleaves
,If you come, I will stay
,You better should just fall asleep
,Try to see please
,Shots of cleaves
,If you want, I will stay

,Oh the wind whistles down
,The cold dark street tonight
,And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
,And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
,While the shocked too many sit way over there
,And the songs they get louder
,Each one better than before
,
,And you're singing the songs
,Thinking this is the life
,And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
,Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
,Where you gonna sleep tonight?

,And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size
,Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

,Where you gonna sleep tonight?
,
,So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
,And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
,But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
,So you're sitting there with nothing to do
,Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
,And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
,
,And you're singing the songs
,Thinking this is the life
,And you wake up in the morning and you're head feels twice the size

,You fade away
,Afraid our aim is out of sight
,Wanna see us

,Where are you now
,Where are you now

,Where are you now
,Another dream
,The monster's running wild inside of me
,I'm faded

,So lost, I'm faded
,I'm faded ~~~
,So lost, I'm faded
,These shallow waters never met
,What i needed
,I'm letting go
,A deeper dive
,Eternal silence of the sea
,I'm breathing
,Alive.
,Where are you now

,Under the bright but faded lights
,You set my heart on fire

,the rock we built us upon
,how could it just disappear
,like a never matter
,I don't know how to watch you leave
,but there's nothing left to say

,That's aiding our hearts to grow
,in pain
,So forget your past, and we can
,Dream tomorrow
,Save our hearts for care and
,Lovin too
,It's hard I know, but oh one things
,For sure
,Don't go and break this fragile heart
,A hurting mind in need of emotion
,I don't think I could endure
,Another pain
,But baby in you, I've found affection
,Affection I have never felt before
,So don't let your past
,Destroy what comes tomorrow
,Don't go and break my fragile heart
,With all this fire that burns
,Between us
,There's so much to lose, yet so much
,More to gain
,And if I could choose the world
,Around me
,The world to choose, would all
,Revolve around you
,So help me complete the game
,Inside me
,And help to mend my fragile heart
,Hello, let me know if you hear me
,Hello, if you want to be near, let me know
,And I'll never let you go

,If only you could see the tears
,In the world you left behind
,If only you could heal my heart
,Just one more time
,Even when I close my eyes
,There's an image of your face
,And once again I come to realise

,Goodbye to you my trusted friend
,We've known each other since we were nine or ten
,Together we've climbed hills and trees
,Learned of love and ABC's
,Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
,Goodbye my friend it's hard to die
,When all the birds are singing in the sky
,Now that spring is in the air
,Pretty girls are everywhere
,Think of me and I'll be there
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time
,Goodbye Papa please pray for me
,I was the black sheep of the family
,You tried to teach me right from wrong
,Too much wine and too much song
,Wonder how I got along
,Goodbye Papa it's hard to die
,When all the birds are singing in the sky
,Now that the spring is in the air
,Little children everywhere
,When you see them I'll be there
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
,Yeah yeah
,Goodbye Michelle my little one
,You gave me love and helped me find the sun
,And every time that I was down
,You would always come around
,And get my feet back on the ground
,Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die
,When all the birds are singing in the sky
,Now that the spring is in the air
,With the flowers everywhere
,I wish that we could both be there
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
,But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone
,We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun

,Just because I'm losing
,Doesn't mean I'm lost
,Doesn't mean I'll stop
,Doesn't mean I'm across
,Just because I'm hurting
,Doesn't mean I'm hurt
,Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
,No better and no worse
,I just got lost
,Every river that I tried to cross
,Every door I ever tried was locked
,Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
,You might be a big fish in a little pond
,Doesn't mean you've won
,'Cause along may come a bigger one
,And you'll be lost
,Every river that you tried to cross
,Every gun you ever held went off
,Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the firing's stopped
,Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
,Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
,Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

,Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
,But honestly it's better if you do it for yourself

,This being human is a guest house
,Every morning a new arrival
,
,A joy, a depression, a meanness
,Some momentary awareness comes
,As an unexpected visitor
,
,Welcome and entertain them all!
,Be grateful for whoever comes
,Because each has been sent as a guide
,Been around the world, the wonders to view
,Been around the world, looking for someone like you

,And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
,My army of one is gonna fight for you
,Been around the world, The universe too
,I've been around flying, baby, It's nothing I wouldn't do
,Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
,And be standing here beside you
,Right when the storm comes through
,Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
,Never so high as when I'm with you
,And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
,My army of one is gonna fight for you
,My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah
,Cause you reign
,All cause you reign
,All cause you reign
,My army of one is gonna call it through
,Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
,Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
,It's my only weapon, army of one
,Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
,So I reach for it
,Stare into darkness, staring at doom
,My heart go boom, bo-boom boom
,Stare into darkness, admit defeat
,Coming home and I'm finding no peace
,And I know, and I know and I know

,Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
,(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
,(So I reach for it)
,Stare into darkness, staring at doom
,You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
,Superhero, a masterpiece
,Been innocent but a sinner in me
,And I know, and I know and I know
,I know I'm in luck
,And I know, and I know and I know
,I know when I'm not

,The angels sing to me these words
,And sometimes, in your eyes
,I see the beauty in the world
,
,Oh, now I'm floating so high
,I blossom and die
,Send your storm and your lightning to strike
,Right between the eyes

,Sometimes the stars decide
,To reflect in petals in the dirt
,When I look in your eyes
,I forget all about what hurts
,
,Oh, now I'm floating so high

,Pouring in to put out the pain
,Oh again and again

,Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
,Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
,Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized
,It's easy to be lethal
,I'm learning from the news
,It's a guidebook for the blues
,Saying it's the very same steeple
,People want to chose

,When it feels like the end of my world?
,When I should but I can’t let you go?
,But when I’m cold, cold
,Oh when I’m cold, cold
,There’s a light that you give me
,When I’m in shadows
,There’s a feeling you give me, an everglow
,Like brothers in blood
,Sisters who ride
,And we swore on that night
,We'd be friends 'til we died
,But the changing of winds
,And the way waters flow
,Life as short as the falling of snow
,And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
,But when I'm cold, cold
,In water rolled, salt
,I know that you’re with me
,And the way you will show
,And you’re with me wherever I go
,And you give me this feeling this everglow
,Oh, what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
,Yeah, I live for this feeling this everglow
,So if you love someone, you should let them know
,Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

,Oh, I think I landed
,In a world I hadn’t seen
,When I'm feeling ordinary
,When I don't know what I mean

,For the thirst and for the hunger
,Come the conference of birds
,Saying it's true
,It's not what it seems
,Leave your broken windows open
,And in the light just dreams
,And you get a head
,A head full of dreams
,You can see the change you want to
,Be what you want to be
,And you get a head
,A head full of dreams
,It's a love, I've just been spoken
,With a head full, a head full of dreams
,Oh, I think I landed
,Where there are miracles at work
,When you got me open handed
,When you got me lost for words

,I'll sing it one last time for you
,Then we really have to go
,You've been the only thing that's right
,In all I've done
,And I can barely look at you
,But every single time I do
,I know we'll make it anywhere
,Anywhere from here
,Light up light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Louder louder
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,
,To think I might not see those eyes
,It makes it so hard not to cry
,And as we say our long goodbye
,I nearly do
,Light up light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Louder louder
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,Slower slower
,We don't have time for that
,All I want is to find an easier way
,To get out of our little head
,Have heart my dear
,We're bound to be afraid
,Even if it's just for a few days
,Making up for all this mess
,
,Light up light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Screaming your name at the top of my lung
,Doesn't make a change
,But it makes me feel stronger
,I'm finally ready to but may we were both wrong
,It took me a while to realize it's gone and we're done
,I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
,I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
,Don't you worry any more
,It's easier to leave then be left behind
,You know
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,At first I thought, it was just about a dream
,But chain of words leading to a dead end, end
,I sharpen my eyes to make you believe I 'll survive
,You did you good but you killed me inside~ide
,I'm ok now but I want you to stay away
,I don't feel sad and I'm not going alone
,Don't you worry any more
,It's easier to leave then be left behind
,You know
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,Now I'm ok , but I want you away
,
,You know I don' t care if I' m right or not
,Got it in my head and I just can' t stop
,Sometimes what you see is all I got
,It might not look a lot, it might not look a lot
,Maybe I wake up sometime soon
,Got it in my head that it might come true
,If I don' t even try then I' m bound to loose
,There' s still so much to do, there' s still so much to do
,I' m waiting
,Could be waiting here awhile
,I' m still here
,Till I know I' ve got it right
,I' m waiting
,I won' t let it pass me by
,I' m waiting
,I' ll come through the other side
,
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go
,Got your hand in mine and I won' t let go

,I was spending my time in the duldrums
,I was caught in a couldron of hate
,I felt persecuted and paralysed
,I thought that everything else would just wait
,While you are wasting your time on your enemies
,Engulfed in a fever of spite
,Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
,Like shadows into the night
,To martyr yourself to caution
,Is not going to help at all
,Because there'll be no safety in numbers
,When the right one walks out of the door
,
,Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
,Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
,Stuck in a world of isolation
,While the ivy grows over the door
,So I open my door to my enemies
,And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
,but they tell me to please go fuck myself
,You know you just can't win
,
,The world was on fire and no one can save me but you.
,
,strange what desire can make foolish people do.
,
,I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
,
,I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.
,
,No I don't wanna fall in love
,
,No I don't wanna fall in love
,
,With you
,
,What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you.
,
,What a wicked thing to say, to make me feel this way.
,
,What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you

,Take a little walk to the edge of town
,And go across the tracks
,Where the viaduct looms,
,Like a bird of doom
,As it shifts and cracks
,Where secrets lie in the border fires,
,In the humming wires
,Hey man, you know
,You're never coming back
,Past the square, past the bridge,
,Past the mills, past the stacks
,On a gathering storm comes
,A tall handsome man
,In a dusty black coat with
,A red right hand
,
,He'll wrap you in his arms,
,Tell you that you've been a good boy
,He'll rekindle all the dreams
,It took you a lifetime to destroy
,He'll reach deep into the hole,
,Heal your shrinking soul,
,But there won't be a single thing
,That you can do
,He's a god, he's a man,
,He's a ghost, he's a guru
,They're whispering his name
,Through this disappearing land
,But hidden in his coat
,Is a red right hand
,
,You don't have no money?
,He'll get you some
,You don't have no car?
,He'll get you one
,You don't have no self-respect,
,You feel like an insect
,Well don't you worry buddy,
,'Cause here he comes
,Through the ghettos and the barrio
,And the bowery and the slum
,A shadow is cast wherever he stands
,Stacks of green paper in his
,Red right hand
,
,You'll see him in your nightmares,
,You'll see him in your dreams
,He'll appear out of nowhere but
,Ge ain't what he seems
,You'll see him in your head,
,On the TV screen
,And hey buddy, I'm warning
,You to turn it off
,He's a ghost, he's a god,
,He's a man, he's a guru
,You're one microscopic cog
,In his catastrophic plan
,Designed and directed by
,His red right hand
,
,If only I didn't want the world
,I wouldn't make you feel so sad
,I'm sure my shame would be gone
,Is it human to adore life?
,If only I'd hidden my lust
,And starved a little bit more
,If only I didn't ask for more
,Is it human to adore life?
,I adore life
,If only I'd lived beyond regret
,I wouldn't feel guilt for what I take
,Is it human to ask for more?
,Is it human to adore life?
,I know evil when I see it
,I know good and I just do it
,If I hadn't been so starved
,Is it human to adore life?
,I understand the urgency of life
,In the distance there is truth which cuts like a knife
,Maybe I will die maybe tomorrow so I need to say
,I adore life
,If only I had been more shy
,And hid every tear I cried
,If only I didn't wish to die
,Is it human to adore life?
,If only I didn't care so much
,For the feel of your cold, cold touch
,In every bed I leave behind
,Is it human to adore life?
,I understand the urgency of life
,In the distance there is truth which cuts like a knife
,Maybe I will die maybe tomorrow so I need to say
,I adore life
,I adore life
,Do you adore life?
,I adore life
,Do you adore life?
,I adore life
,Do you adore life?
,I adore life
,Do you adore life?
,I adore life
,Do you adore life?

,Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
,Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
,Where the miles are marked in the blood and the gold
,I'll meet you further on up the road
,Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
,My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
,I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold

,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall

,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
,And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?

,I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
,I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
,I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
,And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall
,And what will you do, my blue-eyed son?
,And what will you do, my darling young one?
,I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
,Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
,Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
,Where black is the colour and none is the number
,Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
,But I’ll know my song well before I start singing
,And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
,It’s a hard rain’s a-gonna fall

,Take a little walk to the edge of town
,Go across the tracks
,Where the viaduct looms
,Like a bird of doom
,As it shifts and cracks
,Where secrets lie in the border fires
,In the humming wires
,Hey man, you know
,You're never coming back
,Past the square, past the bridge
,Past the mills, past the stacks
,On a gathering storm comes
,A tall handsome man
,In a dusty black coat with
,A red right hand
,He'll wrap you in his arms
,Tell you that you've been a good boy
,He'll rekindle all those dreams
,It took you a lifetime to destroy
,He'll reach deep into the hole
,Heal your shrinking soul
,But there won't be a single thing that you can do
,He's a god, he's a man
,He's a ghost, he's a guru
,They're whispering his name
,Through this disappearing land
,But hidden in his coat
,Is a red right hand
,You don't have no money?
,He'll get you some
,You don't have no car?
,He'll get you one
,You don't have no self-respect
,You feel like an insect
,Well don't you worry buddy
,Cause here he comes
,Through the ghetto and the barrio
,And the bowery and the slum
,A shadow is cast wherever he stands
,A stack of green paper in his
,Red right hand
,
,You'll see him in your nightmares
,You'll see him in your dreams
,He'll appear out of nowhere but
,He ain't what he seems
,You'll see him in your head
,On the TV screen
,And hey buddy, I'm warning
,You to turn it off
,He's a ghost, he's a god
,He's a man, he's a guru
,You're the one microscopic cog
,In his catastrophic plan
,Designed and directed by
,His red right hand
,
,
,It's up in the morning and on the downs
,
,Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
,
,And I am breathless over you
,And the red-breasted robin beats his wings
,His throat it trembles when he sings
,For he is helpless before you
,The happy hooded bluebells bow
,And bend their heads all a-down
,Heavied by the early morning dew
,At the whispering stream  at the bubbling brook
,The fishes leap up to take a look
,For they are breathless over you
,Still your hands
,And still your heart
,For still your face comes shining through
,And all the morning glows anew
,Still your mind
,Still your soul
,For still  the fare of love is true
,And I am breathless without you
,
,The wind circles among the trees
,And it bangs about the new-made leaves
,For it is breathless without you
,The fox chases the rabbit round
,The rabbit hides beneath the ground
,
,For he is defenceless without you
,The sky of daytime dies away
,And all the earthly things they stop to play
,For we are all breathless without you
,I listen to my juddering bones
,The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
,
,And I am breathless without you
,Still your hands
,And still your heart
,For still your face comes shining through
,And all the morning glows anew
,Still your soul
,Still your mind
,Still  the fire of love is true
,And I am breathless without you

,I've wasted a year or so
,I lost my will some time ago
,frustration comes when friends succeed in doing things
,but then again that's me
,I want to be a good friend
,I want to find my best friend
,someone who wants to stay
,someone who doesn't go away

,There is a buzzard of gulls traveling in the wind
,Only lovers alive running in the dark
,And I rolled away
,Said we never wanted much
,Just a rollercoaster
,Our love has never konwn the way
,Sugar for the pill
,You know it's just the way things are
,Cannot buy the sun
,This jealousy will break the whole
,Cut across the sky
,Move a little closer now
,Lying in a bed of greed
,You know I had the strangest dream
,And I rolled away

,Blowing bubbles, lying down,
,Waiting for the rain to fall.
,
,Laughing at the people,
,Wonder why they always rush, never slow down.
,And we're smiling, when we're sleeping.
,And we're smiling, when we're waking.
,Even if the rain falls down, and all the sky turns cold,
,I will feel fine.
,Thunder roared and lightning flashed,
,But you and I are in a different time.
,Floating in and out of time,
,In and out of space.
,
,No one can touch us,
,We're in a different place

,La neige me dévoilera ton vrai visage.
,Vois-tu ces blocs gris?
,Ce sont les nouveaux rochers,
,Il n'y pousse pas de mousse.
,Vois-tu ces grands bâtons droits?
,Ce sont les nouveaux arbres.
,Vois-tu ces grands bâtons droits?
,Ce sont les nouveaux arbres.
,Vois-tu ces grands bâtons droits?
,Ce sont leurs nouvelles armes.

,She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge
,She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
,That's where I
,Caught her eye
,She told me that her Dad was loaded
,I said "In that case I'll have a rum and coca-cola"
,She said "Fine"
,And in thirty seconds time she said
,I want to live like common people
,I want to do whatever common people do
,I want to sleep with common people
,I want to sleep with common people
,Like you
,Well what else could I do
,I said "I'll see what I can do"
,I took her to a supermarket
,I don't know why
,But I had to start it somewhere
,So it started there
,I said pretend you've got no money
,She just laughed and said
,"Oh you're so funny"
,I said "Yeah?
,Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here
,Are you sure you want to live like common people
,You want to see whatever common people see
,You want to sleep with common people
,You want to sleep with common people
,Like me

,Rent a flat above a shop
,Cut your hair and get a job
,Smoke some fags and play some pool
,Pretend you never went to school

,You'll never watch your life slide out of view
,And dance and drink and screw
,Because there's nothing else to do
,Sing along with the common people
,Sing along and it might just get you through
,Laugh along with the common people
,Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
,And the stupid things that you do
,Because you think that poor is cool
,Like a dog lying in a corner
,They will bite you and never warn you
,Look out,they'll tear your insides out
,'Cause everybody hates a tourist
,Especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh
,Yeah and the chip stain's grease
,Will come out in the bath
,You will never understand
,How it feels to live your life
,With no meaning or control
,And with nowhere left to go
,You are amazed that they exist
,And they burn so bright

Resistance

Is our secret safe tonight
and are we out of sight
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place
is this our last embrace
or will the walls start caving in?
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
but it should have been right
It could be wrong could be....
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart
and they wont to stop breaking us down
Hold me
our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police

we can't hide the truth inside
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong,
but it should have been right
It could be wrong could be....
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart
and they wont to stop breaking us down
Hold me
our lips must always be sealed
The night has reached it's end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
Its time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm

作词 : Smith
As stiff as toys and tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds
She talked about the armies
That marched inside her head
And how they made her dreams go bad
But oh, how happy she was
How proud she was
To be fighting in the war
In the empty world
As stiff as toys and tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds

  Only the magical transit children, sing sing a lullaby bah, bah, bah
 Sitting on a pavement sucking on a long straw
 It's colourful, It's colourful, but it washes you out
 
 Here is my violence and here is the excuse
 I learnt it all, but only second hand
 Falling into walls, well what is it with you
 You'd never know, never know, never know
 
 We planned it all this way, we planned it all this way
 Pressure on Julian
 
 Swimming in yellow pissy water, sand getting in between the ears
 No blood in head in this bloody weather
 Irate people with yellow tongues
 
 Only the magical transit children, sing sing a lullaby bah,bah,bah
 Falling into walls, well what is it with you
 You'd never know, never know, never know
 
 We planned it all this way, we planned it all this way
 Pressure on Julian
 
 (There was pressure on Julian, pushing trolleys in the car park
 From B to A then back to B
 Pressure on Julian
 Passing out, precious little snout
 The birds are singing at night
 The birds are singing at night, Pressure on Julian)
 
 We planned it all this way, we planned it all this way

,I remember all of the things that I though I wanted to be
,So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath
,Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
,This ain't easy it's not meant to be
,Every story has it's scars
,
,But when the pain cuts you deep
,When the night keeps you from sleeping
,Just look and you will see
,That I will be your remedy
,When the world seems so cruel
,And your heart makes you feel like a fool
,I promise you will see
,That I will be, I will be your remedy
,No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
,Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through

,Like a spotlight the water hits me
,Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth

,I nervously rehearse for when you're around
,And I keep waiting like you might change my mind
,Who wrote the book on goodbye?
,There's never been a way to make this easy
,When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
,Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
,Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
,Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
,Though I know that our time is ending
,I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
,And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
,Give me one more night

,Took the breath from my open mouth,
,Never known how it broke me down,
,I went in circles somewhere else
,Shook the best when you love was home,
,Storing up on your summer glow,
,you went in search of someone else
,And I hear your ship is comin’ in
,Your tears a sea for me to swim
,And I hear a storm is comin’ in
,My dear is it all we’ve ever been?
,Caught the air in your woven mouth,
,Leave it all I’ll be heaving how you went
,In search of someone else
,Taught the hand that taut the bride,
,Both our eyes lock to the tide
,We went in circles somewhere else
,And I hear your ship is comin’ in
,Your tears a sea for me to swim
,And I hear a storm is comin’ in

,We would light up the sky when we'd fly
,You were orange and red like the sun when it sets
,I was green as an apple's eye

,You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing
,Like nothing that you'd ever heard
,And I said I loved you with all of my heart when

,We would sing when the morning would come
,You were silver and blue like the moon when it's new
,I was gold as a summer sun
,
,But one day you asked for a different song
,One that I just couldn't sing
,I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
,Those were the last days of spring
,
,To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests
,Like a book tearing out every page
,We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
,Into a beautiful cage

,Instead I've found no meaning.
,I guess it's time I run far, far away;
,find.fort in pain,
,All pleasure's the same:
,it just keeps me from trouble.
,Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
,I've heard what they say,
,but I'm not here for trouble.
,It's more than just words:
,it's just tears and rain.
,How I wish I could walk
,through the doors of my mind;
,（Hold memory close at hand）
,Hold memory close at hand,
,Help me understand the years.
,How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
,How I wish I would save my soul.
,I'm so cold from fear.
,I guess it's time I run far, far away;
,find.fort in pain,
,All pleasure's the same:
,it just keeps me from trouble.
,Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
,I've heard what they say,
,but I'm not here for trouble.
,Far, far away; find.fort in pain.
,All pleasure's the same:
,it just keeps me from trouble.
,It's more than just words:
,it's just tears and rain.
,Tears and rain
,Tears and rain
,Far, far away; find.fort in pain.
,All pleasure's the same:
,it just keeps me from trouble.
,It's more than just words:
,it's just tears and rain.

,Did I disappoint you or let you down?
,Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
,'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
,Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
,
,So I took what's mine by eternal right.
,Took your soul out into the night.
,It may be over but it won't stop there,
,I am here for you if you'd only care.
,
,You touched my heart you touched my soul.
,You changed my life and all my goals.
,And love is blind and that I knew when,
,My heart was blinded by you.

,And as you move on, remember me,
,Remember us and all we used to be
,
,I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
,I've watched you sleeping for a while.
,I'd be the father of your child.
,I'd spend a lifetime with you.
,I know your fears and you know mine.
,We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
,And I love you, I swear that's true.
,I cannot live without you.
,
,Goodbye my lover.
,Goodbye my friend.
,You have been the one.

,In mine when I'm asleep.
,And I will bear my soul in time,
,When I'm kneeling at your feet.
,
,Goodbye my lover.
,Goodbye my friend.
,You have been the one.
,You have been the one for me.

,I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
,Some things we don't talk about
,Rather do without and just hold the smile
,Falling in and out of love

,Hear the drops of drizzle time
,About the long gone fairytale

,When you hear the bells from afar
,I'll be waiting there in the dark
,And send my wish upon a star
,
,Raindrops falling on the rooftop

,Your tears, they mean nothing to me.
,The wind, howling at the window
,The love you never gave,
,I give to you -really don't deserve it -
,but now, there's nothing you can do
,So sleep in your only memory
,And weep, my dearest mother

,It was always you that I despised
,I don't feel enough for you to cry, (oh my)
,Here's a lullaby to close your eyes, (goodbye goodbye)...
,So insignificant
,Sleeping dormant deep inside of me
,Are you hiding away, lost Under the sewers
,Maybe flying high In the clouds
,Perhaps you're happy without me
,So many seeds have been sown on the field
,And who could sprout up so blessedly if I had died
,I would have never felt sad at all
,You will not hear me say I'm sorry

,now for the final part of the four-part Late Night Tales story Flat of Angles
,written by Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I didn't know anything could be so perfect
,the lights of the Mirabal
,a thousand swirling eyes
,I dream of relaxing nights
,there are loads of people in my flat when I got home
,I'm already one for big crowds
,makes me want to retreat into my shell
,I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out
,this is a reconstruction
,I can't tell how it happened
,there are too many angles,too many reflections
,the harder I look at another,the more I see myself
,it feels like I'm here alone in this crowd
,myself projected round the room
,the Mirrorball,a beam splitter
,when contentment comes upon me ,I have to find ways to destroy it
,I slide the hairs in the coffee cup up its walls
,click the Catalan while it rushes and hisses
,I danced with spiders
,one of those spindly ones or legs and angles made up of lines is feasting on its prey caught up in a mesh
,the kettle clicks off
,my skin creeps and my head hurts
,I need to suffer more
,I was feeling too comfortable for a second there I guess
,he was there to save me
,alone in a freezing wooden flawed flat which I couldn't heat
,he sent me this Mirabal ordered on the Internet
,he came later
,I'd had no money for a fewdays
,he was desperate for a cigarette
,I remembered that when I was younger
,I'd hid some in a tin full of movie stubs
,and limited edition chocolate bar wrappers
,I found that in and inside was one single cigarette
,throwing the stuff aside
,I placed the cigarette carefully on my dry lips and patter caked my pockets in a panic
,located lighter and flicked the flame into existence
,I drew deeply tobacco and paper
,crackling my alveoli filled my blood vessels roared
,my scalp tingled and stomach turned
,hairs on my arm stood up and so did I
,lunging headfirst for the window flung open in one motion
,drinking down the black cool air as my mind shrieked
,I can't feel my arms
,now I'm here who's been a happy person
,I work hard and try not to let people down
,if they would not be there
,there would be no one to let down
,things have to be a certain way
,there is a beauty in order
,I've cleaned this flat today before leaving for work there
,I cleaned the storeroom arranged items in
,the window smile that the customers
,chose appropriate music wrap gifts gave
,change smile that the staff told them stories of my past
,smoked a cigarette by the bins,ordered sage colored visors from the parlaying catalogue
,lay down on the four-poster bed with no mattress
,glanced out of the window ,cleaned the windows ,warm some soup,dusted the labs ,waited for the Sun to set,counted listened locked
,and then it was time to walk home
,this is not my town ,but then again where is?
,these are not my people,but is anyone really?
,he is here again
,wind milling round the rooms
,knocking ashtrays over
,bellowing to be heard
,desperation in his eyes
,I know how he feels
,but he does something about it
,he gets out of his face ,waits for a gap in the conversation
,and jabbers his philosophy without solicitation
,our eyes meet across the room
,and I feel a little like the spider
,I gathered the spent cans in a blue plastic off-licence bag and smile as I stoop
,how is your weak beam
,well work was quite good sold the chiminea last and looking forward to tonight
,you've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for
,
,And now for the third part of four-part Late Night Tales story
,"Flat of Angles"
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benendict Cumberbatch
,I just can't access my thoughts
,Or put them into words
,I think now my brain recycle been awaiting deletion
,Still no reply to my text, I send to its ...
,Oh, let me see
,9:48, and it's now 10 o'clock
,She hasn't texted to me in response
,To my imploring, longing, yearning message
,full of wiring sudden grief
,Thus, morning!
,How are you
,I enjoyed our journey in the dark so can't wait this night!
,Back at my place, looking forward to the gig tonight
,what time can you get there?
,Where is Rhythm Factory?
,Have a great day!
,Kiss.
,As many questions as possible all crying out for response
,surface lightness, reflective even
,Asking after, referring to events our showing her I'm thinking of her
,The kiss bow
,That was contemplative for a good five minutes although we held hands briefly
,Near McDonald's on the Earl's Court Road last night
,I don't know that was to forward the kiss, too presumptuous now
,But, her touch, sent a clean electric impulse  through me
,up my arm, into my brain
,It cuts through the K, the sodium light
,the rain I longed to protect her from my arms
,Now he's check of the message this phone results
,a little clutch of pain somewhere of the sanity is heart
,The snails are climbing all over the wall in my bathroom
,There is a bush outside the window
,when it rains if I've left the window open
,which I need to, sometimes
,They crawl in
,The iridescent tracery they leave on
,Unknown journey sparkles in the bob light
,I take a Tesco-bag glove and gather them,
,bundle them out the window.
,My time spend with you before the war.
,She said she was going to Spain, hoped it wouldn’t rain,
,heard it wouldn’t rain. I wanted to go too,
,she said she was a solo traveler,
,But it was her rule,
,she goes on journeys alone.
,With plenty to read.
,I recommend some books, so that perhaps a thought of me would go with her.
,Perhaps I am the only thought she had.
,Or more probably, she never thought of me, as I did of her.
,I wanted to say these things,
,but there was always a wall around me,
,I could never tell people how much they meant to me.
,I could tell others how much I hated some people,
,but could never even tell a friend I appreciated their company
,until I’d had 10 cans, then it would descend into a stereotypical drunken
,“You’re my best mate, you are.”
,So we opened that bottle of absinthe, and sat on the couch.
,I knocked a copy of The Face onto the floor,
,and cleared away a few cans with my boots.
,We turned to face each other there,
,an my knee touched hers.
,I looked at our knees together,
,hers at the top of the black leather boots, hidden in grey woollen tights,
,with little bobbles on them.
,Her knee moved imperceptibly away,
,but I felt it.
,I looked up to her face
,as she said “Drink a shot with me, and look me in the eye as you do.”
,We did.
,I didn’t feel the effect of the alcohol,
,but her eyes gave me a warm glow,
,I was swallowed by them,
,as she swallowed the green liquid.
,I couldn’t get enough.
,We did it again and again.
,Rinse, then repeat.
,As needed.
,Well, we were fabric for a drama bass night
,we were about to bow about four
,Just getting our coats, when we were
,Tim getting some sorts of trouble
,with the coat room attendant, he lost his ticket
,She said "we'd have to wait until the end to get the coat
,So we had to sit outside
,by the meat market, in the freezing cold
,At least wear our coats
,Until 8, when it was finally over
,Tim's was only coat hanging around in the middle of this desert
,And then Tim, put his hand, in his jeans' pocket
,and pulls out a sweat rubbish ruffled ticket
,saying "I had it all along"
,Doug, saw this, he just screws his hands up into his face
,forces them to his side
,shaking, grating his teeth, groaning
,moving off slowly, muttering "fuuuuuuuu(ck)"
,Oh no, my number will be on her phone.
,They’ll know.
,I need to get round there and delete the calls.
,So it
,Out of the strong, came forth sweetness.
,It says that on the tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup.
,Have you ever noticed that?
,It has a picture of a lion, dead,
,surrounded by bees, buzzing around,
,and feasting on the lion’s innards.
,It is from a Biblical story,
,someone was going somewhere,
,saw the lion dead in the sunshine,
,and carried on.
,On his way back,
,the bees had started to form a hive within the lion,
,and were creating honey.
,Hence out of the strong...
,I have enough here to join her, to join the lion.
,I can’t walk around the block once more, again.
,I’ve been doing that for years, and I have never escaped.
,I don’t even know why I’m doing it.
,I’m going nowhere, like those snails, except out the window.
,The streets are full of mercenary eyes.
,Veins full of evil serum.
,90 degrees from window.
,Right down to its gables.
,You've been listening to Late Night Tales
,Music and stories worth staying up for.
,
or worse, someone who knows me walks by.
,I hope you enjoy the finally files Late Night Tales selection
,Welcome
,To the first part of the four part late night tell story Flat of Angles
,Written by  Simon Cleary and read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,I’ll miss you,
,I’ll miss our walks,
,trying to pretend we are in perfect step.
,Out of step now,
,sick on the floor,
,out of the room,
,fenced in, trapped.
,I can still hear the schoolchildren play outside at their usual 10:30.
,It always used to annoy me, as I was trying to sleep, but it doesn’t now.
,It seems alright.
,A replacement, a continuation.
,Their sound jangles around the room,
,it sounds so different from where I’ve been.
,A party, alone.
,Packed in with others, but never feeling so alone.
,People dance too close.
,She was there, I had only gone because I hoped she would be.
,I had arrived early, as the the streetlights were coming on,
,so I took a long walk around the block,
,taking a few extra lefts and rights,
,past the Chicken Cottage and the Costcutter,
,then along a crescent that arced me out of my way,
,past a group of figures huddled under the entrance to the flats,
,shielding the flicking lighter from the wind.
,This... area is little more than a traffic island,
,a triangle around which cars and coaches stream into town up the bleak Old Kent,
,or out into Kent and the coast.
,The same faces trudge around there for yeas.
,“Spare some change please? Much as possible.”
,“You want to buy some weed.”
,“Do you have a spare cigarette?”
,He always wants one.
,And that one about weed was not a question.
,There is a Samaritans office between two everely dilapidated buildings on a black-bricked terrace.
,It has a thermometer painted on a 10 ft wooden board nailed to the outside.
,There is red paint up to the ￡0 mark, and, an ambitious 10 ft higher,
,is written ￡200,000. It never got any warmer there.
,The Man begging in the corner makes me take a huge detour when going towards my flat.
,He looks up with a pitiful stare that makes me want to kick the misery out of him.
,His dipit wee cup of unwanted coffee.
,A child’s sleeping bag.
,JJB sports.
,A crack, a release, his poor exhaust.
,He was lost.
,The Broadway.
,The Town Hall, such a grand building, all nautical reminiscences, here, far from water.
,It would be quite a sight if you could get far back enough from it to take a look.
,But my back is up against the black panelling of the gay sauna opposite,
,a coach thunders by, and I run past the video shop that I owe ￡5 to.
,Meaning go way back.
,I may be becoming one of those people you see in New Cross.
,I have a book, peeping out of one pocket, at least want to look vaguely intellectual if someone I know,
,I throw down the finish can into the pile between two walls, outside my flat.
,Look, there’s the hardware store.
,It has a large cutout of a radiant man and woman in overalls,
,the woman handing the man a tin of paint, up his ladder, beaming.
,It has faded in the sun.
,I bought creosote from there, once.
,What a night!
,Pure ment..!
,It was messy!
,It was out of hand! It was out of space!
,I rapped on that track once, at Bagley’s, remember it?!Skibbadee handed me the mic,
,I got to shout “I’M GONNA SEND HIM TO OUTER SPACE TO FIIIND ANOTHER RACE!”
,Absolutely fantastic, those days…
,The pills these days are not the same, they don’t work.
,No love.
,I was chatting to this bloke in the kitchen, and he said something,
,I can’t remember what,
,but I had to push him over, crashed his arse on the coffee table,
,ash tinnies and CDs everywhere!
,Spilled the lines too, the fat bastard.
,I can’t get you out of my head,
,your loving is all I think about,
,no I can’t get you out of my head,
,something something is all I think about.
,I can’t get this loop out of my head,
,no I think I’ll have to…
,I need to sit down.
,I can’t stop my leg jiggling,
,it wants to be somewhere else.
,I need to get out of here.
,I can hear sirens – can you hear them?
,Then again, they are always here,
,the background to day to day life here.
,When music is playing, and they come,
,they sometimes sync up.
,The New Cross Remix, I call it.
,I used to... call it.
,This isn’t how it advertised itself.
,It was fun, it was Technicolour, the music made me feel liquid,
,I melted into the company and was chief among them.
,I was in the kitchen, pouring pint after pint of water over myself, insisting to a stranger that
,“No, no… The drinks are on me!”
,I can’t remember what happened after that.
,Except her there. I had managed to talk to her,
,I was talking about an art gallery, I thought she’d be impressed,
,but her eyes kept dancing around the space behind me,
,smiles flickered on her lips as her eyes focussed on scenes I was oblivious to.
,I heard laughter. It was from my throat, but I didn’t feel it.
,I was just trying to breathe life into a long-dead persona.
,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
,All mimsy were the borogoves,
,And the mome raths outgrabe.
,'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
,The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
,Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
,The frumious Bandersnatch!
,He took his vorpal sword in hand:
,Long time the manxome foe he sought
,So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
,And stood awhile in thought.
,And as in uffish thought he stood.
,The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
,Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
,And burbled as it came!
,One, two! One, two! And through and through
,The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
,He left it dead, and with its head
,He went galumphing back.
,'And thou hast slain the Jabberwock?
,Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
,O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!
,He chortled in his joy.
,'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
,Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
,All mimsy were the borogoves,
,And the mome raths outgrabe.

,Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Benedict Cumberbatch
,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
,A stately pleasure-dome decree :
,Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
,Through caverns measureless to man
,Down to a sunless sea.
,So twice five miles of fertile ground
,With walls and towers were girdled round :
,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;
,And here were forests ancient as the hills,
,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
,But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !
,A savage place ! as holy and enchanted
,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
,By woman wailing for her demon-lover !
,And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
,A mighty fountain momently was forced :
,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
,Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :
,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
,It flung up momently the sacred river.
,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
,Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :
,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
,Ancestral voices prophesying war !
,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
,Floated midway on the waves ;
,Where was heard the mingled measure
,From the fountain and the caves.
,It was a miracle of rare device,
,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !
,A damsel with a dulcimer
,In a vision once I saw :
,It was an Abyssinian maid,
,And on her dulcimer she played,
,Singing of Mount Abora.
,Could I revive within me
,Her symphony and song,
,To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
,That with music loud and long,
,I would build that dome in air,
,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !
,And all who heard should see them there,
,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !
,His flashing eyes, his floating hair !
,Weave a circle round him thrice,
,And close your eyes with holy dread,
,For he on honey-dew hath fed,
,And drunk the milk of Paradise.
,Scotty checked out this morning
,in his customary way
,with a glass of good malt whisky in his hand
,at least that's what they say
,he didn't leave much owing
,when he finally paid the bill
,maybe he should've settled a few good scores
,but now i guess
,he never will
,
,i remember the time he told me
,we were born under a golden star
,and maybe sometimes we couldn't find it
,and the journey seemed too far
,but it was just a matter of hanging in
,and we'd get there in the end
,well it seems you're going to find it
,my crazy beautiful friend
,
,Mr.scott has left the building
,the big old 12 strings is packed away
,the gig is finally over and Scotty's on his way
,but there's a song i still keep singing

,cause Scotty's out there somewhere

,My sweet creature, when I send this round, I shall be in the front parlor
,Watching to see you show yourself for a minute in the garden
,When I look back upon the ecstasies in which I have passed some days
,And the miseries in their turn
,I wonder the more at the beauty which has kept up the spell so fervently
,How horrid was the chance of slipping into the ground instead of into your arms
,The different is amazing, love
, 作词 : John Keats
,My  heart  aches,and  a  drowsy  numbness  pains
,My  sense,as  though  of  hemlock  I  had  drunk,
,Or  emptied  some  dull  opiate  to  the  drains
,One  minute  past,and  Lethe-wards  had  sunk:
,'Tis  not  through  envy  of  thy  happy  lot,
,But  being  too  happy  in  thine  happiness --
,That  thou,light  winged  Dryad  of  the  trees,
,In  some  melodious  plot
,Of  beechen  green,and  shadows  numberless,
,Singest  of  summer  in  full-throated  ease.
,O,for  a  draught  of  vintage!that  hath  been
,Cooled  a  long  age  in  the  deep-delved  earth,
,Tasting  of  Flora  and  the  country  green,
,Dance,and  Provencal  song,and  sunburnt  mirth!
,O  for  a  beaker  full  of  the  warm  South,
,Full  of  the  true,the  blushful  Hippocrene,
,With  beaded  bubbles  winking  at  the  brim,
,And  purple-stained  mouth,
,That  I  may  drink,and  leave  the  world  unseen,
,And  with  thee  fade  away  into  the  forest  dim.
,Fade  far  away,dissolve,and  quite  forget
,What  thou  amongst  the  leaves  hast  never  known,
,The  weariness,the  fever,and  the  fret
,Here,where  men  sit  and  hear  each  other  groan;
,Where  palsy  shakes  a  few,sad,last  grey  hairs.
,Where  youth  grows  pale,and  spectre-thin,and  dies;
,Where  nut  to  think  is  to  be  full  of  sorrow
,And  leaden-eyed  despairs;
,Where  Beauty  cannot  keep  her  lustrous  eyes,
,Or  new  Love  pine  at  them  beyond  to-morrow.
,Away!away!for  I  will  fly  to  thee,
,Not  charioted  by  Bacchus  and  his  pards,
,But  on  the  viewless  wings  of  Poesy,
,Though  the  dull  brain  perplexes  and  retards.
,Already  with  thee!tender  is  the  night,
,And  haply  the  Queen-Moon  is  on  her  throne,
,Clustered  around  by  all  her  starry  Fays;
,But  here  there  is  no  light,
,Save  what  from  heaven  is  with  the  breezes  blown
,Through  verduous  glooms  and  winding  mossy  ways.
,I  cannot  se  what  flowers  are  at  my  feet,
,Nor  what  soft  incense  hangs  upon  the  boughs,
,But,in  embalmed  darkness,guess  each  sweet
,Wherewith  the  seasonable  month  endows
,The  grass,the  thicket,and  the  fruit-tree  wild --
,White  hawthorn,and  the  pastoral  eglantine;
,Fast  fading  violets  covered  up  in  leaves;
,And  mid-May's  eldest  child,
,The  coming  musk-rose,full  of  dewy  wine,
,The  murmurous  haunt  of  flies  on  summer  eves.
,Darkling  I  listen;and  for  many  a  time
,I  have  been  half  in  love  with  easeful  Death,
,Called  him  soft  names  in  many  a  mused  rhyme,
,To  take  into  the  air  my  quiet  breath;
,Now  more  than  ever  seems  it  rich  to  die,
,To  cease  upon  the  midnight  with  no  pain,
,While  thou  art  pouring  forth  thy  soul  abroad
,In  such  an  ecstasy!
,Still  wouldst  thou  sing,and  I  have  ears  in  vain --
,To  thy  high  requiem  become  a  sod.
,Thou  wast  not  born  for  death,immortal  Bird!
,No  hungry  generations  tread  thee  down;
,The  voice  I  hear  this  passing  night  eas  heard
,In  ancient  days  by  emperor  and  clown:
,Perhaps  the  self-same  song  that  found  a  path
,Through  the  sad  heart  of  Ruth,when,sick  for  home,
,She  stood  in  tears  amid  the  alien  corn;
,The  same  that  oft-times  hath
,Charmed  magic  casements,opening  on  the  foam
,Of  perilous  seas,in  faery  lands  forlorn.
,Forlorn!the  very  word  is  like  a  bell
,To  toll  me  back  from  thee  to  my  sole  self!
,Adieu!the  fancy  cannot  cheat  so  well
,As  she  is  famed  to  do,deceiving  elf.
,Adieu!adieu!thy  plaintive  anthem  fades
,Past  the  near  meadows,over  the  still  stream,
,Up  the  hill-side;and  now 'tis  buried  deep
,In  the  next  valley-glades:
,Was  is  a  vision,or  a  waking  dream?
,Fled  is  that  music --Do  I  wake  or sleep?
,
,Bent double， like old beggars under sacks，
,Knock-kneed， coughing like hags， we cursed through sludge，
,Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
,And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
,Men marched asleep.
,Many had lost their boots.
,But limped on， blood-shod.
,All went lame； all blind；
,Drunk with fatigue； deaf even to the hoots
,of disappointed shells that dropped behind.
,Gas！ Gas！ Quick， boys！ - An ecstasy of fumbling，
,Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time；
,But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
,And floundering like a man in fire or lime ……
,Dim， through the misty panes and thick green light，
,As under a green sea， I saw him drowning.
,In all my dreams， before my helpless sight，
,He plunges at me， guttering， choking， drowning.
,If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
,Behind the wagon that we flung him in，
,And watch the white eyes writhing in his face，
,His hanging face， like a devil's sick of sin；
,If you could hear， at every jolt， the blood
,Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs，
,Obscene as cancer， bitter as the cud of vile，
,Incurable sores on innocent tongues，
,My friend， you would not tell with such high zest
,To children ardent for some desperate glory，
,The old Lie： Dulce et decorum est
,Pro patria mori.
,
,
,O what can ail thee knight-at-arms
,Alone and palely loitering?
,The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
,And no birds sing!
,
,O what can ail thee knight-at-arms
,So haggard and so woe-begone?
,The squirrel's granary is full
,And the harvest's done.
,
,I see a lily on thy brow
,With anguish moist and fever dew
,And on thy cheeks a fading rose
,Fast withereth too—
,
,I met a Lady in the Meads
,Full beautiful, a faery's child
,Her hair was long, her foot was light
,And her eyes were wild—
,
,I made a Garland for her head,
,And bracelets too, and fragrant zone:
,She look'd at me as she did love
,And made sweet moan—
,
,I set her on my pacing steed
,And nothing else saw all day long
,For sidelong would she bend and sing
,A faery's song—
,
,She found me roots of relish sweet
,And honey wild and manna dew
,And sure in language strange she said
,"I love thee true"—
,
,She took me to her elfin grot
,And there she wept and sigh'd full sore
,And there I shut her wild wild eyes
,With kisses four.
,
,And there she lulled me asleep
,And there I dream'd—Ah Woe betide!
,The latest dream I ever dreamt
,On the cold hill's side.
,
,I saw pale kings and princes too
,Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
,They cried "La belle dame sans merci
,Hath thee in thrall."
,
,I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam
,With horrid warning gaped wide
,And I awoke and found me here
,On the cold hill's side.
,
,And this is why I sojourn here
,Alone and palely loitering;
,Though the sedge is wither'd from the Lake,
,And no birds sing—
,
,
,
,
,
,My dearest lady,
,I am now at a very pleasant cottage window
,looking onto a beautiful hilly country,
,with a view of the sea.
,The morning is very fine.
,I do not know how elastic my spirit might be,
,what pleasure I might have in living here
,if the remembrance of you did not weigh so upon me.
,Ask yourself, my love, whether you are not very cruel to have so entrammelled me,
,so destroyed my freedom.
,For myself, I know not how to express my devotion to so fair a form.
,I want a brighter word than bright,a fairer word than fair.
,I almost wish we were butterflies
,and lived but three summer days.
,Three such days with you I could fill with more delight
,than 50 common years could ever contain.
,When you can confess this in a letter
,you must write immediately
,and do all you can to console me in it,
,make it rich as a draft of poppies
,to intoxicate me,
,write the softest words and kiss them
,That I may at least touch my lips where yours have been
,“My dear Mr. Keats, thank you for your letter.
,Lately I have felt so nervous and ill that I had to stay five days in bed.
,Have received your letter,
,I am up again, walking our paths on the heath.
,I’ve begun a butterfly farm in my bedroom in honor of us.
,Sammy and Toots are catching them for me
,Samuel has made a science of it
,and is collecting both caterpillars and chrysalises
,so we may have them fluttering about us a week or more.”
,“I have two luxurious to brood over in my walks,
,your loveliness and the hour of my death.
,O that O could have possession of them both in the same minute.
,I never knew before what such a love as you have made me feel was.
,I did not believe in it.
,But if you will fully love me,
,though there may be some fire,
,it will not be more than we can bear when moistened and bedewed with pleasures.”
,
,Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
,Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun
,Conspiring with him how to load and bless
,With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
,To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
,And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
,To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
,With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
,And still more, later flowers for the bees,
,Until they think warm days will never cease,
,For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
,Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
,Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
,Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
,Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
,Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
,Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
,Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
,And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
,Steady thy laden head across a brook;
,Or by a cider-press, with patient look,
,Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
,Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
,Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,-
,While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
,Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
,Among the river sallows, borne aloft
,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
,And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
,Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
,The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
,And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

,How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
,I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
,My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
,For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
,I love thee to the level of everyday's
,Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
,I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
,I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
,I love thee with the passion put to use
,In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
,I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
,With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,
,Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,
,I shall but love thee better after death.

,And now for the second part of the fourth part late night tale stories
,Flat of Angles
,Written by Simon Cleary
,And read by me Benedict Cumberbatch
,Is there any more drink around here?
,Do you have any?
,Its alright, I haven’t been to bed yet
,I’m not drinking in the morning!
,I swear I had a couple of…
,No I think I had them before I headed out last night.
,I sometimes feel like I am in the 1980s
,Or perhaps it's part  of my mom's fault watching Esatenders
,With  my family lying back on the green velour sofa
,Looking out at the sodium lights of the A505
,Hands fiddling with the glass on the tarnished aluminium of
,The Secondary double glazing thinking imagining romantic futures
,Set out for me by songs
,From top of the pops Twisted by lyrics of Genesis
,Starry starry nights
,Paint your pallid blue and grey
,Red and gold
,Are royal colors
,Yeah, yeah
,Industrial state
,Instead
,Anyway, like I say, it was great
,I was waiting in the corridor, to go to the toilet,
,Standing right in front of the door.
,It opened, and this girl was standing there.
,I was a little shocked, hadn’t expected it, and jumped a little.
,She did the same thing a second later, smiling.
,I tilted my head left, about to speak, and look sympathetic,
,And she tilted her head right.
,I raised my right hand, she raised her left.
,I put it back by my side, straightened my head,
,And she did the same.
,“I’ll be your mirror.” she said.
,Nothing else existed for a second there, I felt calm, and wanted no more.
,Then some chump who had slunk up the corridor goes
,“Awww, that is so cute!”
,I barged past her and slammed the door,
,Shot the lock across,the handle fell off.
,This can’t actually have happened.
,She is only 28.Only.
,What are we doing with our lives?
,Why are we carrying on like this?
,For God’s sake, why don’t we grow up?
,Pretending we are hip,
,Throwing our bodies around the room,around the town,
,Projected on cheap MDMA and ciders with ice, our shadows are long.
,They slip over the horizon, grow thinner,
,And disappear only the all-encompassing shadow of night takes over.
,That is greater than any of us.
,Then morning comes, and it goes away.
,It peels the film from eyes,
,Sparks cells into action,
,And eventually resurrects those who have avoided it.
,It says here is a day
,Do with it as you will.
,I am back, but she…
,I’m well up for keeping the session going
,Why did I even come back here?
,God knows.
,I’ll give her a call,
,See what she’s up to.
,We could swing down the Talbot for a few cures.
,Its ringing.
,Oh nooo… What happened?
,I think that…
,Hey! Where did you get to last night?
,Fancy a Bloody Mary at The Talbot?
,Give us a call when you get this!
,No. She wouldn’t move.
,I think I lied next to her.
,I lied.
,We had that methlathyl-whatever when I got out of the toilet.
,She had given that bloke the heave-ho.
,I can’t even remember her face.
,Just the strange flock texture on the wallpaper behind her in the corridor,
,The magnolia paintwork,
,The sick yellow light from a bare bulb,
,And decades of greasy black hand marks by the top of the stairs.
,Her eyes were…
,Black.

, 作曲 : Berg
,Spelar det längre någon roll
,Jag orkar inte slåss
,Det är bortom min kontroll
,Du lämnade mig ensam
,Och självklart blev jag rädd
,Min sista gnista hopp
,Var att synas att bli sedd
,Och jag glömmer bort att andas
,För sex, musik och våld
,Var det vackraste som hänt mig
,Sen själen min blev såld
,Att synas utan att verka
,Ser enkelt ut på håll
,Men jag lever på impuls nu
,Via fjärrkontroll
,Men jag sa alltid nej
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Och gäst ikväll är Jesus
,Han har kickat heroin
,Han läppjar på sitt glas
,Och Ramlösa blir vin
,Han berättar om sina vapen
,Sin tid i Saint-Tropez
,Om att ge sig själv en chans
,Om sin nya Z-3
,I en värld av Idioter
,Står han först i kön
,Han berättar framför kameran
,Om hur han bytte kön
,Eller nåt helt annat
,Som också är privat
,Om alla dom han älskat
,Och dom han bara sög av
,Men han sa alltid nej...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...

,But I am over the things you did to me
,It's uneasy but it's true
,Didn't I say

,To sweep beneath the climbing frame
,If the sun's in your eyes,
,I'll tighten your blindfold, baby
,Don't worry your foot won't get cut
,Strut carelessly
,when you say that you need me tonight
,I can't keep my feelings in disguise
,The white parts of my eyeballs illuminate
,I'll wait for you
,As if I'm waiting for a stone to stop
,I've heard them talking
,About how I'm gonna put you off
,There's glass in the park
,And now that I'm up off my knees
,I've picked up the speed
,To jump your palaces
,And I shoot through the night
,And suddenly all those once lost concoctions froth
,And chase the day away
,When you say that you need me tonight
,I can't keep my feelings in disguise
,The white part of my eyeballs illuminate
,And I'll wait for you
,As if I'm waiting for the stone to stop
,I've heard them talking
,About how I'm gonna put you off
,You tell me, "how can I put you off when you're a matter of urgency?"
,I've got a million things that I need to do, but they're all secondary
,Make sure you're not followed
,Meet me by the Death Balloon
,Paraselene woman, I'm your man on the moon
,And like a grain of diamond dust, you float
,And my devotion's outer crust' cracks

,Worn out places, worn out faces
,Bright and early for their daily races

,
,With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
,Stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
,And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction

,I know that we're both afraid
,
,We both made the same mistakes
,
,An open heart is an open wound too
,
,And in the wind there's a heavy choice
,
,Love has a quiet voice
,
,Still remind, now I'm yours too
,
,And I know the scariest part is letting go
,
,Let my love be the light that guides you home
,
,And I know the scariest part is letting go
,
,Cause love is a ghost you can't control
,
,I promise you the truth can't hurt us now

,I believe in miracles
,Cause it's a miracle I'm here
,Guess you could call me spiritual
,Cause physical is fear
,And it's safe to say the storms gone away
,And I'm dancing on the morning after
,Yes I'd love to stay but my home is the other way
,And I miss the love and laughter
,Something like flying
,Hard to describe it
,My god I'm breathing underwater
,Something like freedom freedom
,My god I'm breathing underwater
,Every moon and every star
,Knows who you are you know
,So ever if gets too dark
,You never are alone
,And it's safe to say we surrendered a day
,To pay back all the love you borrowed
,And hope that I had survived yesterday
,And today is jealous of tomorrow
,Something like flying
,Hard to describe it
,My god I'm breathing underwater
,Something like freedom freedom

,One that I just couldn't sing
,I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
,Those were the last days of spring
,
,To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests
,Like a book tearing out every page
,We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
,Into a beautiful cage
,You are the avalanche
,One world away
,My make believing
,While i'm wide awake
,Just a trick of light
,To bring me back around again
,Those wild eyes
,A psychedelic silhouette
,I never meant to fall for you but I
,Was buried underneath and
,All that i could see was white
,My salvation my my
,My salvation my my
,You are the snow storm
,I'm purified
,The darkest fairytale
,In the dead of night
,Let the band play out
,As i'm making my way home again
,Glorious we transcend
,Into a psychedleic silhouette
,I never meant to fall for you but I
,Was buried underneath and

,You walked with me
,Footprints in the sand
,And helped me understand
,Where I’m going
,You walked with me
,When I was all alone
,With so much I no along the way
,Then I heard you say
,I promise you
,I’m always there
,When your heart is filled
,with sorrow and despair
,I’ll carry you
,When you need a friend
,You’ll find my footprints
,in the sand
,I see my life
,Flash across the sky
,So many times have I
,Been so afraid ooh
,And just when I
,Have thought I’ve lost my way
,You give me strength to carry on
,That’s when I heard you say
,I promise you
,I’m always there
,When your heart is filled
,with sorrow and despair
,I’ll carry you
,When you need a friend
,You’ll find my footprints
,in the sand
,When I’m weary
,Well I no you’ll be there
,And I can feel you
,When you say
,I promise you
,I’m always there
,When your heart is full of
,sadness and despair
,I’ll carry you
,When you need a friend
,You’ll find my footprints
,in the sand
,oooooo mmmmmmmm

,
,Stalled
,In the mid of my street
,And I'm needing some clarity
,And I carve
,The radio
,To find a song like you, like you
,
,Oh, no I'm not looking back
,To rewrite our stories past
,I gave up years ago
,And as guarded as I am
,I've got things I've left unsaid
,Now forever I'll keep
,
,Well, I'm livin' in the shade of my mind
,I just stopped for a second, I reason
,I move forward like the seasons
,
,Linked
,To adventures, I can't see
,And I'm dreamin' of some time to breathe
,And I'll walk to them till I'm black and blue
,In search of a new
,Won't wait until I'm older
,
,Oh, no I'm not looking back

,I move forward like the seasons
,Yes, I do, I believe
,That one day I will be where I was
,Right there, right next to you
,And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
,The moon, the stars are nothing without you
,Your touch, your skin,
,Where do I begin?
,No words can explain the way I’m missing you
,Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
,These tears, they tell their own story
,You told me not to cry when you were gone
,But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,And make sure you’re alright?
,I’ll take care of you,
,And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight
,I’m reaching out to you
,Can you hear my call?
,This hurt that I’ve been through
,I’m missing you, missing you like crazy
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,And make sure you’re alright?
,I’ll take care of you,
,And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight
,Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
,Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,
,The weight
,of a simple human emotion
,weighs me down
,more than the tank ever did
,The pain
,it's determined and demanding
,to ache, but I'm okay . . .
,And I don't wanna let this go
,I don't wanna lose control
,I just wanna see the stars with you
,And I don't wanna say goodbye
,someone tell me why
,I just wanna see the stars with you
,You lost, a part of your existence
,in the war, against yourself
,oh, the lights,
,they light up in lights of sadness
,telling you, it's time to go
,And I don't wanna let this go
,I don't wanna lose control
,I just wanna see the stars with you
,And I don't wanna say goodbye
,someone tell me why
,I just wanna see the stars with you
,Don't give it up just yet stay grand
,for one more minute, don't give it up
,just yet stay grand(no)
,Don't give it up just yet stay grand
,for one more minute, don't give it up
,just yet stay grand(no)
,Don't give it up just yet stay grand
,for one more minute, don't give it up

,How wonderful life is while you're in the world
,I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
,Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
,But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
,It's for people like you that keep it turned on

,I always knew if I could find a girl
,Who sees the way I see the world
,I'd give her my life
,Will you give me your life?
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Say you will
,Picture this
,Me and you
,Little house with a rim brand hue
,Well this country town
,As the sun drops down
,And on the other side of that window pane
,A storm might spin that weather vane
,But we can rise above
,If you feel my love
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Girl you're my rhapsody
,The sound of your symphony
,Is a thousand violins
,When life's stray stars collide
,And with our two hearts tonight
,And the circle has no end
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water

Oh, I love this house, I love this house
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, I love to hear those conkers fall
Smash 'em on an Southwark stone
And I love that here you live with me
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
Yes, I've been too long a rolling stone
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned
Oh, I love the curling of your hair
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Recited Butler Yeats there in your grace
Your grace, your grace
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned
Returned
Returned
And if I had to die today
Scatter my ashes on this place
And I live on in your grieving heart
But until that day that we depart
Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known

,Today, today is the day
,I’m waking up to say
,I’m tired of the way
,The way that I change
,I rearrange
,Myself to be
,The man that everybody loves
,So I become someone I’m not
,Who am I gonna be
,When no body’s watching me
,I want to be real
,What am I gonna do
,To live what I know is true?
,I let go
,Oh I’ve been someone else
,I’m ready to be myself
,Now, now is the time
,To open up my eyes
,And see what I will find
,I find I
,Made up my mind
,To be the man that everybody loves
,So I become someone I’m not
,Who am I gonna be
,When no body’s watching me
,I want to be real
,What am I gonna do
,To live what I know is true?
,I let go
,Oh I’ve been someone else
,I’m ready to be myself
,I want to be something more
,Then a man who needs to be adored
,it shouldn’t matter to me
,And with every breath that I have left
,I wanna breath it out hoping that
,He says “you’ve done well”
,Who am I gonna be
,What am I gonna do
,I let go
,Who am I gonna be
,When no body’s watching me
,I want to be real
,What am I gonna do
,To live what I know is true?
,I let go
,Oh I become someone
,Oh I become someone
,Oh I become someone else
,I’m ready to be myself
,I’m ready to be myself

,
,
,I can feel the air run through me
,Reality slips past me
,And my eyes are now closing
,And there you are, you are, now I'm dreaming
,When I close my eyes, you don't walk away
,When I close my eyes, all your steps lead to me
,I can go back in time and make that change
,When I close my eyes, you stayed
,When you closed that door on me
,I felt the wind rush through me
,I look at the clock, it stops
,as my heart hits rocks, and my stomach drops now
,It tires me out
,And I realize now
,When I close my eyes, you don't walk away
,When I close my eyes, all your steps lead to me
,I can go back in time and make that change
,When I close my eyes, you stayed
,I can't sleep, I can't breathe
,and now I'm with you
,because my eyes are closed
,and I can't lose you, no
,I can't speak, I can't breathe
,and now I'm with you
,because my eyes are closed
,and I can't lose you, no!
,When I close my eyes, you don't walk away
,When I close my eyes, all your steps lead to me
,I can go back in time and make that change
,When I close my eyes, you stayed
,When I close my eyes
,When I close my eyes, yeah
,I can go back in time, re-write that page
,When I close my eyes
,You stayed.
,I'm writing you for the hundredth time
,cuz ninety nine I threw away
,And in my mind a thousand times
,I've said everything I wanna say
,I've said everything I wanna say
,But you find a way to keep me hanging on
,You find a way to make everything go wrong
,It's the way you lose me
,Say you choose me
,Then pass me by like you never knew me
,You find a way to lead me on
,I change my mind a thousand times
,but circumstances stay the same
,I told you no an hour ago
,I've said everything I wanna say
,I've said everything I need to say
,But you find a way to keep me hanging on
,You find a way to make everything go wrong
,It's the way you lose me
,Say you choose me
,Then pass me by like you never knew me
,Til I find a way of moving on
,And when I think I've figured out
,I've found a way to live without
,You come around and everything's all wrong
,I'm waking up alone at night
,remembering when the time was right
,You're only here a moment then you're gone
,You find a way to keep me hanging on
,You find a way to make everything go wrong
,It's the way you lose me
,Say you choose me
,Then pass me by like you never knew me
,You find a way to keep me hanging on
,You find a way to make everything go wrong
,It's the way you lose me
,Say you choose me
,Then pass me by like you never knew me
,Til I find a way of moving on
,You find a way you lead me on
,I'll find a way
,I'm movin on
,From when I wake
,In the morning 'till I go and
,And I fall asleep each night
,I fight to hold on to
,A love that is inside
,
,Because my past is like a nightmare
,
,That I never can escape
,And I can't wait till I wake up so I can fall back asleep
,And I don't understand what
,happened between you and me, but
,You will probably end up
,with someone half as good as me, so
,I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
,You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, know
,So now I wait
,for the moment when I know that there's no one left to see
,All the hurt that's inside me and the reason that I need
,I need to let go of the things I see that have always let me fall
,And I cannot find my way home, no, because I'm already home
,And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
,You will probably end up with someone half as good as me, so
,I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
,
,You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, know
,
,Blind to me, blind to you
,
,And I don't know what you need
,But I know your listening now
,And I don't care what you think
,Because you didn't think to care about me
,And I don't know what you need
,But I know your listening now
,And I don't care what you think
,Because you didn't think to care about me
,And I don't understand what happened between you and me, but
,You will probably end up with someone you know that is half as good, so
,I don't care if you want to look in my eyes and say hello
,You were blind to me, now I'm blind to you, know
,You were blind to me
,Now I'm blind to you
,La lalalalalala lalalalalala
,So, things will be like before?
,Will you get out of bed and follow through?
,Get dressed and unlock the door?
,See a brand new day through your misty eyes?
,Is it over now?
,Lalalalalala  lalalalalala
,So you won't care what people say?
,Will you pick up the phone each time it rings?
,I know you hate when I talk this way.
,But behind your closed blinks it's a sunny day.
,And it's over now.
,Life will go on, why not fantasize?
,Let's get our hopes up.
,Tell me why not fantasize?
,It's not going to hurt us.

,All the way on the other side
,Wish that I could read your mind
,I'm kissing on your shoulder
,But you don't wanna turn over
,You know I'd rather have another fight
,Than be a victim of a silent night
,You can scream and let it out

,You can say the words
,And I'll be wrong as long as we're alright
,Call me names, I'll take them all

,Takes my fault whatever you like now
,Used to talk, used to talk
,We could talk about everything

,To drain the whole sea
,Get something shiny
,Something meaty for the main course
,That's a fine looking high horse
,What you got in the stable?
,We've a lot of starving faithful
,That looks tasty
,That looks plenty
,This is hungry work
,Take me to church
,I'll worship like a dog

,No masters or kings
,when the ritual begins
,There is no sweeter innocence
,than our gentle sin
,In the madness and soil of
,that sad earthly scene
,Only then I am human
,Only then I am clean
,Amen. Amen. Amen

,All I lost and all I hoped for.
,But I must carry on
,Always one
,Never broken.
,Run to the lobby where I saw you try,
,Don't give a damn for your reasons why,
,Where a soul feels.
,Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
,I'll lead them over to your eyes
,Whoa, oh, I am one, I am one
,Break story of peace and love in a future
,Pride,
,Sacrifice
,Came around
,Never broken
,Down by the people if they let you breathe,
,Don't give a damn if you still can't see.
,Traveling a street that I did not go
,Wheels lightened to the winter load.
,Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
,I'll lead them over to your eyes!

,And all of the lights will lead
,Into the night with me
,
,And I know these scars will bleed
,
,But both of our hearts believe
,All of these stars will guide us home
,I can hear your heart
,On the radio beat
,They're playing 'Chasing Cars'
,And I thought of us
,Back to the time,
,You were lying next to me
,I looked across and fell in love
,So I took your hand
,Back through lamp lit streets I knew
,Everything led back to you
,So can you see the stars?
,Over Amsterdam
,You're the song my heart is
,Beating to
,So open your eyes and see
,The way our horizons meet
,And all of the lights will lead
,Into the night with me
,And I know these scars will bleed
,But both of our hearts believe

,And I won't look now
,And then I looked up at the sun
,And I could see
,Oh the way that gravity pours
,On you and me
,And then I looked up at the sky
,And saw the sun
,And the way that gravity pushes
,on everyone...
,What if there was no life?
,Nothing wrong' nothing right.
,What if there was no time?
,And no reason or rhyme.
,What if you should decide'
,that you don't want me there by your side.
,That you don't want me there in your life.
,
,What if I got it wrong
,and no poem or song
,Could put right what I got wrong
,Or make you feel I belong
,What if you should decide
,that you don't want me there by your side
,That you don't want me there in your life.
,
,Oooh' that's right
,Let's take a breath jump over the side
,Oooh' that's right
,How can you know it if you don't even try
,Oooh' that's right
,Every step that you take
,could be your biggest mistake
,It could bend or it could break
,But that's the risk that you take
,What if you should decide
,That you don't want me there in your life
,That you don't want me there by your side.
,music
,Oooh' that's right
,Let's take a breath jump over the side
,Oooh' that's right
,How can you know it when you don't even try
,Oooh' that's right
,
,Ohhhhh
,Oooh' that's right
,Let's take a breath jump over the side
,Oooh' that's right
,You know that darkness always turns into light
,Oooh' that's right
,
,
,
,In my place, in my place
,Were lines that I couldn't change
,I was lost, oh yeah
,I was lost, I was lost
,Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
,I was lost, oh yeah
,Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
,Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
,Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
,For it
,I was scared, I was scared
,Tired and under-prepared
,But I'll wait for it
,And if you go, if you go
,Leave me down here on my own
,Then I'll wait for you, yeah
,Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
,Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
,Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
,For it
,Singing please, please, please
,Come back and sing to me
,To me, me
,Come on and sing it out,now,now
,Come on and sing it out to me,me
,Come back and sing it
,In my place, in my place

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own 
环视每条曾经属於我的街道 

I used to roll the dice 
过去只要我转动手中的骰子

就能感受到敌人眼中的恐惧 
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
听著人民传颂著 
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

前一刻我还握著世界之钥 
Next the walls were closed on me 
下一秒世界却从我手中消失 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
原来我所竖立的城堡 
Upon pillars of salt, and pillars of sand 
只是不堪一击的砂城 

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
我听见耶路撒冷的鐘声响起 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
罗马的骑兵唱诗班正在吟唱著 
Be my mirror my sword and shield 
请成為我的镜子 我的刀与盾 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
我的传教士流亡在外 
For some reason I can't explain 
我无法解释原因為何 
Once you go there was never, never an honest word 
但是只要你来过 将会发现这裡没有诚实的语言 
That was when I ruled the world 
那就是我曾经统治的世界 

It was the wicked and wild wind 
当时刮起邪恶的狂风 
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
吹垮所有入口的城门让我进入 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
窗户上震碎的玻璃 发出阵阵巨响 
People couldn't believe what I'd become 
人民无法置信我成為他们的国王 
Revolutionaries Wait 
革命者伺机而动 
For my head on a silver plate 
等著我的头颅作為祭品 
Just a puppet on a lonely string 
我只是绑著一条细弦的傀儡 
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
噢 谁会想成為这样的国王

,Hide from the mobs I used to slay
,They once were terrified,
,Everytime I looked into their eyes
,Villagers would cheer my way,
,"For a hero I was", that's what they say
,One minute we had it all,
,Next our world began to fall,
,Away from all it had once become
,They all cried from my help, but I stood there numb
,I gaze off into the boundless skyline,
,Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
,Turn around, pick up my sword and wield,
,The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
,I hope one day that this chaos and,
,Destruction turns for the better
,Never a bow in hand
,That was when I ruled the land
,It was the Creepers and the skeletons,
,Blew down the doors and boxed us in
,Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
,I tried all that I could to stay and fight
,As the undead roamed the street,
,Families broken at my feet,
,Life itself suspended by a thread
,Oh why was it that I wasn't dead?
,I gaze off into the boundless skyline,
,Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
,Turn around, pick up my sword and wield,
,The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
,If this battle should leave me slain,
,I know Herobrine would call my name
,Better to take a stand,
,That was when I ruled the land
,(Woah oh oh...Woah oh oh...)

,So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
,Words they always win, but I know I'll lose

,Six weeks is all you've got
,That’s what they told her yesterday
,She thought that she'd be in a white dress
,Instead of this hospital grey
,Six months ago today
,Is when he asked her for her hand
,And now beneath fluorescents lights
,She’s in a battle she can't win, and she cries
,Hope is all I need, I'm broken and on my knees
,So where is god tonight
,I'm waiting, waiting for love to arrive
,Six years out on the streets
,And not a dollar to his name
,He was happy once before he
,Slowly drank it all away
,Like a sail without the wind
,He’s a man that's lost at sea
,All he wants to be is dry
,But all he ever does is sink
,And he cries
,Hope is all I need
,I’m broken and on my knees
,So where is god tonight
,I'm waiting, waiting for love to arrive
,Six hours on a tree
,Humble god of innocence
,It wasn't fair that he should die
,For someone else's sins
,So when we wonder if he cared
,Just remember he's been there
,So yes, he loves us
,When hope is all we need
,We find it on our knees
,When doubts give way to sight
,He’s been here
,While we're waiting for love to arrive
,

,I don't know where this is going
,I don't know how this all came about
,But all I know is that I'll never
,Forget the way you looked at me that night
,Maybe one day you'll be leavin'
,Maybe one day we'll say "it's over and done
,But right now, I wanna breathe it in and sing it out
,I'm not afraid of where it's taking me tonight
,And somehow this is not the way I planned it
,I didn't think I'd need someone right now
,Then there was you
,Let's get away from here
,Away to a universe that's not so close my dear
,And in my arms you'll stay
,Amazing how you take my breath away
,I'm hoping for the real thing
,And I know I find my realness in you
,These nights are never-ending
,To have you here would be so overdue
,And somehow I'm just falling way too quickly
,The moment that you put your hand in mine
,No wasted time
,Can stars determine what will be of you and me
,'Cuz I see stars when I look in your eyes
,Can you imagine what it'd be just you and me
,Endless possibilities in your eyes
,Can we...
,Get away from here
,Away to the universe that's not so close my dear
,And in my arms you'll stay
,Amazing how you take my breath away
,Amazing how you take my breath away

,She's light when I'm feeling low
,And the ground when I've lost control
,With me in my darkest hour
,Says she loves me still
,I've been lost at sea
,Drowing well she set me free
,With me in my darkest hour
,And the beat of her heart
,Moves an ocean in me
,And I can't help but sing
,Honey, heal my broken heart
,I'm freezing underneath
,And I've been here waiting patiently
,Honey, ease my restless mind
,I cannot get to sleep
,With your healing touch, healing love
,You bring back the life in me
,Fading like a distant star
,Holding back the missing parts
,And she found the good in me
,When I couldn't see
,Everywhere I go these days
,She's never really far away
,With me in my darkest hour
,And she's moving my feet

,Play a game or take it back
,And I appreciated all of that
,Honestly
,That was then and we've both grown
,Up apart we've got our own things going on
,I should have known this is how it'd be
,I know I left so fast' didn't get to ask
,How you felt before I took this path
,Now when I come back
,It just ain't home without you
,So I believe
,A part of me lingers
,In the reverie
,Of you and me
,Oh I believe
,A part of me lingers
,In the reverie
,Every now and again
,A couple drinks'll take me to
,What might have been
,It was clear to me
,That you feel the same way too
,I see it in your eyes whenever I see you
,They stare right back and burn so blue
,They never could lie to me
,I know I left so fast' didn't get to ask
,How you felt before I took this path
,Now when I come back
,It just ain't home without you
,So I believe
,A part of me lingers
,In the reverie
,Of you and me
,Oh I believe
,A part of me lingers
,In the reverie
,But the music will keep on playin'
,And I'mma keep singing along
,To the songs in my head
,What if leaving you was wrong
,So I believe
,Oh I believe
,Oh I believe
,A part of me lingers
,In the reverie

,And the whole world is on your case
,I could offer you a warm embrace
,To make you feel my love
,When the evening shadows and the stars appear
,And there is no one there to dry your tears
,I could hold you for a million years
,To make you feel my love
,I know you haven't made your mind up yet
,But I would never do you wrong
,I've known it from the moment that we met
,No doubt in my mind where you belong
,I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
,I'd go crawling down the avenue
,There's nothing that I wouldn't do
,To make you feel my love
,The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
,And on the highway of regret
,The winds of change are blowing wild and free
,You ain't seen nothing like me yet
,I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
,Nothing that I wouldn't do
,Go to the ends of the earth for you
,To make you feel my love
,When the rain is blowing in your face
,And the whole world is on your case
,I could offer you a warm embrace
,To make you feel my love
,There are so many broken hearts
,So many lives are torn apart
,Looking for something, looking for reason
,Finding escape in all the wrong places
,Getting battered and bruised, blinded and shaken
,The world that we live in. This broken nation
,People want love, but they don't know where it is
,Father release your new generation
,Who'll lead the lost and broken home
,
,So many homes have broken down
,Too many children's hopes fall to the ground
,The homeless want freedom, and someone to feed them
,But we just walk by and we pretend we don't see them
,The broken need love and that love can't be broken
,The world that we live in. This broken nation
,People want love, but they don't know where it is
,Father release your new generation
,Who'll lead the lost and broken home
,
,There are children in the sand
,
,Would you take them by the hand
,
,Lead them to the promised land
,

,They always say
,Never join the circus
,Will they really take care of me
,Love me like I wanna be

,It’s hard to see it from the bottom
,When your light is still shining
,It’s time for you to hurry up now

,Will the room start to cave in
,When my steps start shifting
,Cuz I’ve heard before don’t lose what you believe in
,It’s hard to see it from the top now
,When your light is to blinding
,No time to close your eyes now
,No time for hiding
,It’s hard to see it from the top now
,When you wanna fall back down

,Time alone can't save you
,If that's what you're waiting for
,It's the end of all your battles
,As you're walking out the door
,And you wear that face so bravely
,And gather up your clothes
,And you say you have to go
,And you say you have to go
,Time alone can waste you
,If it's where you place your hope
,With all my uphill struggles
,How long could you cope?
,And you wear that face so bravely
,And stand out in the rain
,But honey, I take all the blame
,Honey, I take all the blame
,Time, they say, can heal you
,Though, that's harder to believe
,When you meet the broken hearted
,And see what it meant to leave
,And with all my misconceptions
,Of what it takes to change
,I guess I'll end up just the same

Bad Meets Evil - The Reunion

This next song, is a true story.
(Come here, bitch!)
(Aah!)
'Cause some things in this universe
Don't make sense, but some how
Always seem to fuckin' work

Flyin' down I-75 'bout to hop into 696,
I look over this fuckin' chick's tryna fix
Her makeup. I'm like "Bitch, you ain't a plastic surgeon.
I advise ya to put up your visor. I'm getting' kyna ticked.
You're blocking my side mirror!" She's like "Yeah, so?"
"I'm like "So? You gon' need a stitch, you keep acting like that, ho.
I look your husband slut? That's a rhetorical question.
You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up!
In fact, get in the back seat, like the rest of my dates...
No bitch rides shotgun. 'What, taxi?'
Stop and pick you some Maxi-Pads up,
Is that what you actually asked me?!"
Bitch reaches over and smacks me
Says I annoy the fuck out her.
"Get the fuck in back. Put on your slut powder,
You slut. What?! Shut the fuck up now-or
Getcha feelings hurt worse than my last chick
When I accidentally butt-dialed her
And she heard me spreading AIDS rumors UH-bout her."
Turn the radio up-louder. Make it thump while I bump
That Relapse CD, tryna hit every bump in that cunt
'Fore I snap back into act-SHUN
'Cause she kept asking me to quit calling her "cunt"!
I said "I cunt!"

She said "Marshall, You ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?
You're breaking my heart." She said:
"You're breaking my heart."
'Cause you ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?.
You're breaking my heart." She said:
"You're breaking my heart."

Uh. pull up to club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there looking at my phone on twitter, tweeting:

I get approached by this little scheezer
She asked me I am the realest G 'cause I'm Gucci from head to feet
I said "Yeah, I'm really is. 'Cause I spit in ya man's face
Like Cam did that little kid on Killa Season
She said "I'm feelin' your big ego. Wait, am I talking wrong?"
I said "Naw, I'm a walkin' Kanye/Beyonce song."
She said "I'm mad at chu."
I said "Why?" She said "Why you never
Make songs with chicks, as if it's hard to do?"
I said "I make songs for me, leave the studio,
And go an' fuck the bitch who go on and make da songs for you!"
She said I'm feeling your whole swagger and flow.
Can we hook up?" I said "Ummm…
You just used the word swagger. So no."
She said…

You ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?
You're breaking my heart." She said:
"You're breaking my heart."
'Cause you ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?.
You're breaking my heart." She said:
"You're breaking my heart."

We been riding around in this hatchback, 'til I'm fucking hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at, slutbag,
Cunt? Cut what act? Think it's act? Fuck that,
I'm tryna shag scuz. Better find this loveshack
Or somewhere the fuck-at… Ah! Don't touch that,
You fat dyke! I'm trine hear some Bagpipes
From Baghdad. Don't act like
You don't like 'em: them accents. I rap tight!
And Imma torture you 'til we find this place. Yeah, that's right!
I thought it was just past this light… just past Van Dyk.
Better hit that maplight, read them directions. Oh yeah…
You can't read. And you can't write. You told me that last night."
She took my CD out the deck, snapped in half, like
(Crack) "Relapse sucked." I snapped, hit the gas like
(Zoom) Blew through the lights, spun out, hit a patch of black ice.
Forgot we had trailer hitched to the back. We jack-knifed.
Bitch flew out the car, I laugh like, she deserved it.
She didn't think I'd act like
That in person.

("Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club!")
Verse 4 (Royce Da 5'9"):
Tell 'em I be there in a minute,
I'm tryna break up this catfight
Between my mistress and damn wife
Then this chick wanted a hug. She was fat,
So I gave her dap, then I tell 'er to scat.
I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, taken' the scenic route

I'm saying: them chicks got horse's asses, they been attractive.
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with them tennis rackets.
My mind drifted back to this shit. I see my wife, push her down
(Aagh!) Step over her body, then smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and past the gat to Viscious
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
(Argh!) He mocks the mistress, turns around gives the misses hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted like Nickel, ("Yeah, watch this shit!")
He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch
He rode with and looks back to mention:
"Royce, it's good to be back to business!"

You ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?
You're breaking our hearts." they said:
"You're breaking our hearts."
'Cause you ain't really like that. Ohh-oh.
You're putting on a show, is your mic dead?.
You're breaking our heart." they said:
"You're breaking our heart."

,They sat together in the park
,As the evening sky grew dark
,She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
,It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
,And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
,They walked alone by the old canal
,A little confused I remember well
,And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
,He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
,Moving with a simple twist of fate.
,A saxophone someplace far off played
,As she was walking on by the arcade
,As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up
,She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
,And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
,He woke up the room was bare
,He didn't see her anywhere
,He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
,Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
,Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
,He hears the ticking of the clocks
,And walks along with a parrot that talks
,Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in
,Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
,One more time for a simple twist of fate.
,People tell me it's a sin
,To know and feel too much within
,I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
,She was born in spring but I was born too late
,Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

,It's a god-awful small affair
,To the girl with the mousy hair
,But her mummy is yelling "No"
,And her daddy has told her to go
,But her friend is nowhere to be seen
,Now she walks through her sunken dream
,To the seat with the clearest view
,And she's hooked to the silver screen
,But the film is a saddening bore
,For she's lived it ten times or more
,She could spit in the eyes of fools
,As they ask her to focus on
,Sailors fighting in the dance hall
,Oh man! look at those cavemen go
,It's the freakiest show
,Take a look at the lawman
,Beating up the wrong guy
,Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
,He's in the best selling show
,Is there life on Mars?
,
,It's on Amerika's tortured brow
,That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
,Now the workers have struck for fame
,'Cause Lennon's on sale again
,See the mice in their million hordes
,From Ibeza to the norfolk broads
,Rule Britannia is out of bounds
,To my mother, my dog, and clowns
,But the film is a saddening bore
,'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
,It's about to be writ again
,As I ask you to focus on
,Sailors fighting in the dance hall
,Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
,It's the freakiest show
,Take a look at the Lawman
,Beating up the wrong guy

 And may you never lay your head down
 Without a hand to hold
 May you never make your bed out in the cold.

,They pursue us to the deep end and then depart
,Watch as the cracks in the wall feel pain
,For only patterns on a snake's back give us genuine fear
,
,And I cannot lie, faces drop into the fire
,I get by all the time on a shelf above the door
,And it shouldn't be clear but it's not for me to decide
,It's a delicate degree
,It's a number I can see
,
,Could prison cells be in my brain
,For they're safe inside the cover of a dirty face
,And everybody finds a college graduate with joy
,While I'm happy just sipping tonic water with lemon and lime
,
,And I cannot lie, faces drop into the fire
,I get by all the time on a shelf above the door
,And it shouldn't be clear but it's not for me to decide

,You sit at home up late at night
,When it's beginning to arrive
,And honestly
,I don't see the need for any routines
,I'm all out of sync, I cover my cuts
,And hope they are fixed before I get hurt again
,
,And all this ground beneath my feet
,Has decided not to crumble into the sea
,I walked in a house, it smelt of paint
,And the ceiling it has no trouble with me

,you'll never get away from here

,It’s not that I resent that you found someone
,It’s just I feel a bit sad
,that I did but couldn’t hold on
,And when doors close
,And windows close
,And then night closes in
,It’s just a bit too much time
,For thinking
,So make up your mind
,Either you stay in touch
,Or take off your hand completely
,We don’t need to be polite
,But it’s that song that you were singing
,As you left
,That keeps going around in my head
,Oh you love this
,The thought of me still holding on
,Well it isn’t out of longing
,Just from fear of being forgotten
,So don’t make me someone needy
,And say it isn’t working for you
,When it’s you who made the blueprint
,When it’s all by your design
,And if we fall apart
,At the same time
,And I come undone at the same lines
,It doesn’t mean that I’m falling in love
,I never have，I never will
,And if we fall apart
,At the same time
,And I come undone at the same lines

,I tried to fight the feeling,

,I struggled and I lost the day

,for all mine I will chase...

,You should never fight your feelings,
,When your very bones believe it,

,
,I’ll live with never knowing,
,if knowing’s gonna change,

,I wrote her letters
,and tried to send them,
,
,In a bottle I placed my hope,

,Will you give it to me,
,Don’t make me wait,
,You build me up, knocked me down,
,But I will stand my ground,
,
,And guide this light
,that I’ve found.

,I see so little time
,My eyes are crossed, my hands are tied
,All I wanna do is that great thing
,I never see a passer-by
,My skin is cold, it's turned to ice
,And everything I do, I want leaving me
,And I guess it's a might
,With a light that you fight
,You turn a blind eye
,To the world in the sky
,I didn't know in your lies
,Above your head you hold so high
,All my energy is behind it
,A dream for the passers-by
,My eyes are wasted here tonight
,I never tried to get across the feeling
,And I guess it's a might
,With a light that you fight
,You turn a blind eye
,To the world in the sky

,There's a song playing through another wall
,All we see and believe

,And it's a shame the plane is leaving
,on this sunny day
,Cos on you my tattoo will be bleeding
, and the name will stain
,But oh if you stay

,We'll go from the bungalows

,but they tell me to please go fuck myself
,You know you just can't win

,in the shivering cold

,I  got  this  feeling  and  I  know  that  something  died
,And  with  this  feeling  comes  the  baggage  that  I'll  try  to  hide
,I  got  this  feeling  it  ain't  good  in  any  way
,I  got  this  feeling  and  it  will  not  go  away
,And  with  this  feeling  comes  the  consequence  that  I  will  try  to  hide
,It's  in  my  head  and  on  my  tongue
,How  am  I  supposed  to  say
,The  words  I  want  to  say
,To  you  right  now
,It's  inevitable
,Dya  know  that  feeling  when  you  know  that  something's  wrong
,You  know  that  feeling  but  you  got  to  get  along
,And  with  this  feeling  comes  the  sickness  that  takes  long  to  disappear
,It's  in  my  head  and  on  my  tongue
,How  am  I  supposed  to  say
,The  words  I  want  to  say
,To  you  right  now
,It's  on  my  mind  but  I  can't  find
,The  string  of  words  to  say
,I've  a  feeling  that  you  may  already  know
,It's  inevitable

,Here I sit,
,With all upon my shoulder,
,Think I'd cry without a love to keep me warm.
,And I'm sure
,The faithfulness grows older,
,I'm as useful as a broken man's reward.
,And so I wait,
,But never see
,How someone so desired could fall for me.
,Well it's just one kiss,
,And it'll all crash down.
,Ignorance is bliss,
,In this cold and wet town.
,If I could bring myself to venture through
,This bold and bruised door,
,Well I might make it...
,Yeah I might make it.
,And so I try,
,With a single glance she cuts me to the bone.
,And I stand,
,Regret the things I told her;
,Because the years can teach you things days never know.
,And so I sit,
,I don't want to leave,
,I don't want to stay;
,But you tear me up
,With those insecure ways.
,Insecure ways...

,As the cheerless towns pass my window
,I can see a washed out moon through the fog
,And then a voice inside my head breaks the analogue
,And says
,"Follow me down to valley below “
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
,I survived against the will of my twisted folk
,But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
,And said
,"Follow me down to valley below “
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
,"Follow me down to valley below ”
,You know
,Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
,"My David don't you worry ”
,This cold world is not for you
,So rest your head upon me
,I have strength to carry you"

,One look would say everything
,About the way you smile
,The way you laugh
,The way you dress
,The way your beauty leaves me breathless
,If eyes could speak
,I wouldn't have to talk
,I tell you all about
,The way you smile
,The way you laugh
,The way you dress
,The way your beauty leaves me breathless
,If eyes could speak
,I wouldn't have to talk
, 作词 : Moroder, Whitlock
,Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
,On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
,Turning and returning to some secret place inside
,Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
,Take my breath away
,Take my breath away
,Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
,Never hesitating to become the fated ones
,Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
,Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
,Take my breath away
,Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away
,When the mirror crashed I called you, and turned to hear you say
,If only for today I am unafraid
,Take my breath away
,Take my breath away
,Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
,Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
,Turning and returning to some secret place inside
,Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
,Take my breath away
,My love, take my breath away
,My love, take my breath away
,Take My Breath Away
,My Love
,you must remember this
,a kiss is just a kiss
,a sigh is just a sigh
,the fundamental things apply
,as time goes by
,and when two lovers woo
,they still say,"i love you."
,on that you can rely
,no matter what the future brings
,as time goes by
,moonlight and love songs
,never out of date
,hearts full of passion
,jealousy and hate
,woman needs man
,and man must have his mate
,That no one can deny
,It's still the same old story.
,A fight for love and glory, a case to do or die.
,The world will always welcome lovers

You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love
Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize
Every man in sight
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
...
You are my angel
Come from way above
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you

,Just a perfect day
,Drink sangria in the park
,And then later, when it gets dark
,We go home
,Just a perfect day
,Feed animals in the zoo
,Then later a movie, too
,And then home
,Oh, it's such a perfect day
,I'm glad I spent it with you
,Oh, such a perfect day
,You just keep me hanging on
,You just keep me hanging on
,Just a perfect day
,Problems all left alone
,Weekenders on our own
,It's such fun
,Just a perfect day
,You made me forget myself
,I thought I was someone else
,Someone good
,Oh, it's such a perfect day
,I'm glad I spent it with you
,Oh, such a perfect day
,You just keep me hanging on

,Lullaby For Cain
,From the silence, from the night
,Comes a distant lullaby.
,Cry, remember that first cry,
,Your brother's standing by,
,And lot of loved
,Beloved sons of mine.
,Sing a lullaby.
,Mother is close by.
,Innocent days
,Such innocent eyes
,And he stole your brother's life,
,Came home murdered, peace of mind.
,Left you nightmares on the pillow.
,Sleep now
,Soul, surrendering your soul,
,The heart in you not whole
,For love, but love walked on
,Cast into the dawn
,Branded with the mark.
,Oh, shame of Cain.
,From a garden of those light
,To a wilderness of night.
,Sleep now
,sleep now
,Across the oceans,across the seas
,Over forests of blackened trees.
,Through valleys so still we dare not breathe.
,To be by your side.
,Over the shifting desert plains.
,Across mountains all in flames.
,Through howling winds and fringing rains.
,To be by your side.
,Every mile and every year.
,For every one a little tear.
,I can not explain this,dear.
,I will not even try.
,Into the night as the stars collide.
,Across the border that divide.
,Forest of stone standing petrified.
,To be by your side.
,Every mile and every year.
,For everyone a single tear.
,I can not explain this,dear.
,I will not even try.
,For I know one thing.
,Love comes on a wing.
,For tonight I will be by your side.
,But tomorrow I will fly.
,From the deepest oceans to the highest peak.
,Through the frontiers of your sleep.
,Into the valley where we dare not speak.
,To be by your side..
,Across the endless wilderness.
,Where all the beasts bow down their heads.
,Darling,I will never rest till
,I am by your side.
,Every mile and every year.
,Time and distance disappear.
,I can not explain this,dear.
,No, I will not even try.
,And I know just one thing.
,Love comes on a wing.
,and tonight I will be by your side.
,But tomorrow I will fly away.
,Love rises with the day.
,And tonight I may be by your side.
,But tomorrow I will fly.
,Tomorrow I will fly.
,Tomorrow I will fly...

,钥匙不忍心欺骗
,想要静静的离开

,让我们自以为有共识
,这会不会是场天大的误会
,别让我看清我们之间
,越靠近越容易发觉
,这一切都不过是错觉
,
,I am very very much in like with you
,I hope that it's enough 'cause it's all I can do

,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?

,Spelar det längre någon roll
,Jag orkar inte slåss
,Det är bortom min kontroll
,Du lämnade mig ensam
,Och självklart blev jag rädd
,Min sista gnista hopp
,Var att synas att bli sedd
,Och jag glömmer bort att andas
,För sex, musik och våld
,Var det vackraste som hänt mig
,Sen själen min blev såld
,Att synas utan att verka
,Ser enkelt ut på håll
,Men jag lever på impuls nu
,Via fjärrkontroll
,Men jag sa alltid nej

,Om sin nya Z-3
,I en värld av Idioter
,Står han först i kön

,Trying to right a wrong
,Just walk away, those windows say

,Oh they flicker and they float
,But I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
,Like some drunken Elvis singing
,I go singing out of tune
,Singing how I always loved you darling
,And I always will
,But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
,Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
,Still waiting for the snow to fall
,It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
,Those Christmas Lights
,Light up the street
,Down where the sea and city meet
,May all your troubles soon be gone
,Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
,Those Christmas Lights
,Light up the street
,Maybe they'll bring her back to me
,Then all my troubles will be gone
,Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on
,Oh
,Ohh Christmas Lights
,Light up the streets
,Light up the fireworks in me
,May all your troubles soon be gone

,Baby I compare you to
,a kiss from a rose on the grey
,The more I get of you stranger it feels yeah
,And now that your rose is is in bloom
,A light hits the gloom on the grey
,There is so much a man can tell you
,So much he can say

,that I can't deny yeah

,and led him to the lonesome hill
,while his daughter hid and watched
,she dared not breathe she was so still
,just as an angel cried for the slaughter

,then the angel asked her what her
,name was she said i have none

,my father never gave me one
,and when he saw her raised for the slaughter
,abraham's daughter raised her bow
,how darest you child defy your father
,you better let young isaac go
