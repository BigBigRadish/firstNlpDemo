No Use For A Name
More Betterness
Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me?
Maybe you don't understand it, what keeps them awake at night
What goes through their little minds when you turn off the light?
Always having to say sorry tears are stained on the pillow
Like the light of the moon they can't be one
Can't exist without the son
Let's think clearly for a while
Can he shine without a smile?
Why am I alone with no one to be found?
Looks like they know what's best for me
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand?
Guess I'll have to crawl inside and I don't know why
I'm sitting by myself, when the problem isn't mine
Been around the block a few times, been beat up by all his friends
Learing life is like a maze that never seems to end
Like an open book, blank pages left for only him to write
Life is short this chapter takes so long
Can't tell the right from the wrong
It's so hard for you to place
An expression on his face
Why am I alone with no one to be found?
Looks like they know what's best for me
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand?
Guess I'll have to crawl inside and I don't know why
I'm sitting by myself, when the problem isn't mine
Why doesn't anybody like me, I don't understand
Why my friends and family left me
At six years old he won't be taught a meaning to this mess
He'll just have to take a guess, and make his own plan
And we'll never see the child that was forced to be a man

You think 
I've gone to far this time? 
Tossed to the wolves, for another feeding frenzy 
If you could see what's going on inside 
You'd probably second guess me my dark secret 
So tell me what is this all about? 
What is this call to arms? 
To test me? 
Take what you need from me 
Discard the rest, but 
I wont go peacefully 
I'm on the edge again 
Of breaking down in a world gone crazy 
I'm on the edge again 
And it's a mystery how it does not phase me 
So tell me how did you think 
I would react? 
I'm a pawn in this game and it's far from over 
This contradiction in terms makes it worse 
Been pushed to the edge kicked down knocked over 
Well here we stand again, and again, and again 
How's it end? is this the best of it? 
You've made it clear my friend 
That this is the end when all ties are broken 
Now taking a step back 
It's not alright 
What's been left behind 
Now looking down a new avenue 
Hoping to see the signs 
Now taking a step back 
What's not alright? 
Taking it one step at a time

,The moon, the stars are nothing without you
,Your touch, your skin,
,Where do I begin?
,No words can explain the way I’m missing you
,Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
,These tears, they tell their own story
,You told me not to cry when you were gone
,But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,And make sure you’re alright?
,I’ll take care of you,
,And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight
,I’m reaching out to you
,Can you hear my call?
,This hurt that I’ve been through
,I’m missing you, missing you like crazy
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
,And make sure you’re alright?
,I’ll take care of you,
,And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight
,Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
,Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
,Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

,Do you recall, not long ago
,We would walk on the sidewalk
,Innocent, remember?
,All we did was care for each other
,But the night was warm
,We were bold and young
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,All we need is somebody to lean on
,What will we do when we get old?
,Will we walk down the same road?
,Will you be there by my side?
,Standing strong as the waves roll over
,When the nights are long
,Longing for you to come home
,All around the wind blows
,We would only hold on to let go
,Blow a kiss, fire a gun
,We need someone to lean on

,It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
,The regular crowd shuffles in
,There's an old man sitting next to me
,Makin' love to his tonic and gin

,He gets me my drinks for free
,And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
,But there's someplace that he'd rather be
,He says' "Bill' I believe this is killing me."

,"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
,If I could get out of this place"

,Now Paul is a real estate novelist

,And probably will be for life
,And the waitress is practicing politics
,As the businessmen slowly get stoned
,Yes' they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
,But it's better than drinkin' alone
,It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
,And the manager gives me a smile
,'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
,To forget about life for a while
,And the piano' it sounds like a carnival
,And the microphone smells like a beer
,And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
,And say' "Man' what are you doin' here?"

,Many nights we pray
,With no proof anyone could hear
,And our hearts a hopeful song
,We barely understand
,Now we are not afraid
,Although we know there's much to fear
,We were moving mountains long
,Before we know we could
,There can be miracles
,When you believe
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracle
,You can achieve
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,In this time of fear
,When prayer so often proves in vain
,Hope seems like the summer birds
,Too swiftly flown away
,And now I am standing here
,My heart's so full I can't explain
,Seeking faith and speaking words
,I never thought I'd say
,There can be miracles
,When you believe (When you believe)
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracle
,You can achieve (You can achieve)
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,They don't always happen when you ask
,And it's easy to give in to your fear
,But when you're blinded by your pain
,Can't see you way safe through the rain
,Thought of a still resilient voice
,Says love is very near
,There can be miracles (miracles)
,When you believe (When you believe)
,Though hope is frail
,It's hard to kill
,Who know what miracles
,You can achieve (You can achieve)
,When you believe
,Somehow you will
,You will when you believe
,You will when you believe
,You will when you believe
,Just believe
,Just believe
,You will when you believe
,I'll sing it one last time for you
,Then we really have to go
,You've been the only thing that's right
,In all I've done
,
,And I can barely look at you
,But every single time I do
,I know we'll make it anywhere
,Away from here
,
,Light up, light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,
,Louder louder
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,
,To think I might not see those eyes
,Makes it so hard not to cry
,And as we say our long goodbye
,I nearly do
,Light up, light up
,As if you have a choice
,Even if you cannot hear my voice
,I'll be right beside you dear
,Louder louder
,
,And we'll run for our lives
,I can hardly speak I understand
,Why you can't raise your voice to say
,Light up, light up

,Now I've heard there was a secret chord
,That David played and it pleased the Lord
,But you don't really care for music, do you?
,It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
,The minor fall and the major lift
,The baffled king composing Hallelujah
,Hallelujah...
,You say I took the name in vain
,I don't even know the name
,But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
,There's a blaze of light in every word
,It doesn't matter what you heard
,The holy or the broken Hallelujah
,Hallelujah...
,I did my best, it wasn't much
,I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
,I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
,And even though it all went wrong
,I'll stand before the Lord of Song
,With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
,Hallelujah...

,Every time I see you and I look into your eyes

,How long' must this feeling go on

,That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say
,You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
,But I know I'm gonna change that tune
,When I'm back on top, back on top in June
,I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
,Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
,But I don't let it, let it get me down
,'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around
,I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
,I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
,Each time I find myself flat on my face
,I pick myself up and get back in the race
,That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it
,I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
,And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
,I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
,I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
,I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
,Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
,I just pick myself up and get back in the race
,That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it
,Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
,But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
,I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die

,세상이 어두워지고
,조용히 비가 내리면
,여전히 그대로
,오늘도 어김없이 난
,벗어나질 못하네
,너의 생각 안에서
,이제 끝이라는 걸 알지만
,미련이란 걸 알지만
,이제 아닐 걸 알지만
,그까짓자존심에널 잡지 못했던 내가
,조금 아쉬울 뿐이니까
,비가 오는 날엔 나를 찾아와
,밤을 새워 괴롭히다
,비가 그쳐가면 너도 따라서
,서서히 조금씩 그쳐가겠지
,취했나 봐 그만 마셔야 될 것 같애
,비가 떨어지니까 나도 떨어질 것 같애
,뭐 네가 보고 싶다거나 그런 건 아냐
,다만우리가가진시간이좀날카로울 뿐
,네가 참 좋아했었던 이런 날이면
,아직 너무 생생한 기억을 꺼내놓고
,추억이란 덫에 일부러 발을 들여놔
,벗어나려고 발버둥조차 치지 않아
,이제, 너를 다 지워냈지만
,모두 다 비워냈지만
,또다시 비가 내리면
,힘들게 숨겨놨던 너의 모든 기억들이
,다시 돌아와, 널 찾나 봐
,비가 오는 날엔 나를 찾아와
,밤을 새워 괴롭히다
,비가 그쳐가면 너도 따라서
,서서히 조금씩 그쳐가겠지
,너에게로 (이젠)
,돌아갈 길은 없지만
,지금 행복한 너를 보며
,난 그래도 웃어볼게
,널 잡을 수 있었던
,힘이 내겐 없었으니까
,비가 오는 날엔 나를 찾아와
,밤을 새워 괴롭히다
,비가 그쳐가면 너도 따라서
,서서히 조금씩 그쳐 가겠지
,어차피 끝나버린 걸 이제 와 어쩌겠어
,뒤늦게 후회나 하는 거지 덜떨어진 놈처럼
,비는 항상 오니까 계속 반복되겠지

,그땐 어려서 그땐 몰라서 널 아프게 했나봐
,이젠 알지만 너무 늦은 건가봐
,너만 보인단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,눈을 감아도 너만 보인단 말야
,너만 부른단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,입을 막아도 너만 부른단 말야
,바보 같은 사랑에 아파서 이기적인 사랑만 내게 줬나봐
,사랑했다는 한마디 못하고 그저 바라만 봤던게 후회가 돼
,미안하단 말 사랑한단 말 들을 수 가 없는데
,이제 와서야 네게 소리 치잖아
,너만 보인단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,눈을 감아도 너만 보인단 말야
,너만 부른단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,입을 막아도 너만 부른단 말야
,내겐 미칠 것 같은 사랑 내겐 죽을 것 같은 사랑
,지독한 상처에도 너야만 하니깐
,너만 찾는단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,매번 숨어도 너만 찾는단 말야
,너만 그린단 말이야 널 사랑한단 말이야
,가슴 저리게 너만 그린단 말야
,너만 부른다 말이야 널 사랑한다 말이야
,입을 막아도 너만 부른단 말야

,我毁掉爱所有到尽头
,无论怎么努力 去放手 不能够
,忘记了你的所有(Let me free)
,无法释怀的所有(Let me breathe)
,听心跳的节奏的每秒钟
,只想跟呼吸的节奏 来生活
,明明我也还能够(Let me free)
,明明我也能复活(Let me breathe)
,但我却害怕被你 尖锐讲出的话刺痛
,连呼吸醒着睡着 以为撑着就没不同
,为爱情的所有 为自己的所有
,拿手将心紧紧握住
,我依然选择自己唯一的路走
,不愿意失去了我
,不愿意毁灭了所有
,当爱情结束 未完却到终点
,我没自信到最后
,爱到心痛不在乎
,难道是你的谎言吗
,好好看着我要把你遗忘
,你眼中反射那个他
,也不能忘掉我吧 (Ah~)
,也不能把我删光 (Ah~)
,那穿过心脏的密码
,我解开解答路很长
,看着混乱那一段乱码
,深呼吸一下 不够再来一下 怎样
,将心中的她撕裂后就走
,无声呐喊的我没人听懂
,擦去空中所有笑容
,遗憾的回忆丟向空中 Burn
,不愿意失去了我
,不愿意毁灭了所有
,当爱情结束 未完却到终点
,我没自信到最后
,爱到心痛不在乎
,难道是你的谎言吗
,好好看着我 要把你遗忘
,你眼中反射那个他
,是不能忘掉我吧 (Ah~)
,再见到你之后 哭之后
,不知为何会 心松动 心残留
,记忆全都关于你(Let me free)
,心中满满全是你(Let me breathe)
,我已经无处可躲 不走
,挽留你的我会痛（挽留我会痛）
,离开你心碎得惨痛
,好像比做梦 更深一层的梦
,没办法甩开再来过
,说好会忘记所有
,是我留下的谎言吗
,心中再一次 布满你脸庞
,比从前心痛更夸张
,思念彻底的延长
,危险又更加延长 OH~

,有人说西安水土让人变得懒惰
,来打把挖坑 我教你啥叫生活

,在西安人的心中 这是西安人的歌
,600年的城墙如今让你随便触摸
,西安的小吃足够让你变成吃货
,在你的脚下曾经埋着王孙显赫
,和平门下马陵是最低调的一个
,西安的女娃喜欢有话啥都直说
,就像这城门儿楼子四四方方的洒脱
,给你说西安地灵说话不敢胡说
,背后说谁坏话可小心不好过

,雨下过后的屋檐，猫坐在路边，
,你吹着风，不说话就很甜。
,微光里树影重叠，骤雨间湿冷麻雀，
,我杜撰许多离别，勇敢而坚决！
,十月过后的天空，醉酒般晕红，
,一半是春夏，一半是秋冬。
,光影飘浮过山峰，留下关于你的梦，
,我在这写下重逢，贫乏而心动！
,想和你看着星空，只谈夜色与微风，
,不关心明天，不在乎所有，
,只对你有独钟。
,是时候和你决定，即便匆忙去远行，
,在山野间追风，去看遍世界，
,黄昏与黎明。
,
,路过转角的花店，你坐在窗前，
,我骑着单车，载着你走很远。
,星光透映着长街，无意间夜色倾斜。
,在纸上写下一页，深沉而浓烈！
,想和你看着星空，只谈夜色与微风，
,不关心明天，不在乎所有，
,只对你有独钟。
,是时候和你决定，即便匆忙去远行，
,在山野间追风，去看遍世界，
,黄昏与黎明.
,
,任时间过往匆匆，轻易就远去无声，
,在人潮之中，想要拥抱你，哪怕片刻永恒，
,我已经偷偷决定，把爱你的事澄清，
,在百念之中，你依然是我，未寻得的旧梦。
,
,十月过后的天空，光影在流动。
,一半是春夏，一半是秋冬。

,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打

,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了

,Return of the Mack, get up!
,What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t.
,Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
,Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
,Get up! Thrift shop pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
,Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweater gang nope nope y’all can’t copy
,Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
,And we did it, our way.
,Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
,And yet I’m on.
,Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
,Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
,But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
,Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,
,Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack,
,fat cat, crushing Labels out here,
,Now they can’t tell me nothing
,We give that to the people,
,Spread it across the country
,Labels out here,

,But that’s what you get when Wu tang raised you
,Y’all can’t stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
,And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
,Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
,Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
,Caesar make you a believer. Now I never ever did it for a throne.
,That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
,Now sing a song and it goes like
,Raise those hands, this is our party
,We came here to live life like nobody was watching
,I got my city right behind me
,If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

,Dumb surfer is giving me his cash
,Won a bet for fifty and now I need a slash
,Man this band that's playing is playing f**king trash
,Skunk and onion gravy as my brain's potato mash
,He came across the back of a bureaucratic stash
,Shot the lot for credit and never got it back
,He's mashed I'm mashed we're mashed
,That cat got slashed in half like that
,As Venus completes orbit I'm feeling slightly mashed
,The stir fry didn't absorb it I need another slash
,She spoke in English it was low lit where we sat
,Remembering her face but that's the end of that
,I'm a step from madness as I puke on pavement slabs
,Got a bit embarrassed need to get back to the lab
,In the depths of traffic I was feeling like we crashed
,With a girl from Slovak in a European cab
,From a set of habits I can see momentums mashed
,If we were commuting this train would f**king crash
,Now my brain's diluting with blame and guilt and hash
,Getting lashed getting lashed by all of the Gods
,By all of the Gods by all of the Gods
,As my brain's diluting I suffer from whiplash
,This girl's now screaming I think we've gone and crashed
,The driver's speaking and the car is still intact
,It was only minor well that's the end of that
,Girl that's the end of that as I know
,Girl some things you don't know
,Dumb surfer don't suffer
,Dumb surfer don't suffer
,Dumb surfer don't suffer
,Dumb surfer don't suffer
,Ay some things won't change for a while
,Keep me keep me as the villain
,But my prayer you don't own
,
,Oh, to see without my eyes
,The first time that you kissed me
,Boundless by the time I cried
,I built your walls around me
,White noise, what an awful sound
,Fumbling by Rogue River
,Feel my feet above the ground
,Hand of God, deliver me
,Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
,The first time that you touched me
,Oh, will wonders ever cease?
,Blessed be the mystery of love
,
,Lord, I no longer believe
,Drowned in living waters
,Cursed by the love that I received
,From my brother's daughter
,Like Hephaestion, who died
,Alexander's lover
,Now my riverbed has dried
,Shall I find no other?
,Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
,I'm running like a plover
,Now I'm prone to misery
,The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
,
,How much sorrow can I take?
,Blackbird on my shoulder
,And what difference does it make
,When this love is over?
,Shall I sleep within your bed
,River of unhappiness
,Hold your hands upon my head
,Till I breathe my last breath
,Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
,The last time that you touched me
,Oh, will wonders ever cease?
,Blessed be the mystery of love

,But truth be told we all have the same end
,Could make you cry cry cry cry cry
,But I'm telling you
,This is the best news you're getting all week
,Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves

,And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to

,And you're getting older
,I promise you this you're getting older
,And there's improvements unless
,You're such a winner
,That the future's a nightmare
,And there's nothing I can do
,Nothing anyone can do about this
,And oh I'm offering you a chance to get even
,But oh you know very well the dialect of negation
,Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
,But friends are the ones who can put you in an exile
,But that's not right
,And you're too shocked to be used
,Or you're too shocked from being used
,By these bullying children of the fabulous
,Raffling off limited edition shoes

,Come laughing at everything we thought was important
,While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
,And reasonable people know better than you
,That cost in the long run but they don't know the short game
,And terrible people know better than you
,They're used and abused of the once so dear listener
,So you will be badgered and taunted until death
,You're missing a party that you'll never get over

,Let me show you, show you the way
,On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
,A burning one, on the edge of dark
,Where no-one can tell their worlds apart
,We'll live with dark, just take the ride
,It's your boy, Thundercat
,Heavy-hearted, but my burden's light
,I just wanna live, learn how to fight
,When it's all over, breathe into the light
,Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die
,Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny

,Naturally the dying man wonders to himself:
,Has commentary been more elusive than anybody else?
,And had he successfully beaten back the rising tide
,Of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
,On his watch while he was alive
,Lord, just a little more time
,Oh, in no time at all
,This'll be the distant past
,Ooh
,So says the dying man once I'm in the box
,Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
,And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
,The homophobes, hipsters, and 1%
,The false feminists he'd managed to detect
,Oh, who will critique them once he's left?
,Oh, in no time at all
,This'll be the distant past
,What he'd give for one more day to rate and analyze
,The world made in his image as of yet
,To realize what a mess to leave behind
,Eventually the dying man takes his final breath
,But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss
,And it occurs to him a little late in the game
,We leave as clueless as we came
,For the rented heavens to the shadows in the cave
,We'll all be wrong someday
,Oh
,Oh
,Oh
,I won't run away no more, I promise
,Even when I get bored, I promise
,Even when you lock me out, I promise
,I say my prayers every night, I promise
,I don't wish that I'm strict, I promise
,The tantrums and the chilling chats, I promise
,Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise
,Tie me to the rotten deck, I promise
,I won't run away no more, I promise
,Even when I get bored, I promise
,Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise

,And you take your time
,And you do your crime
,Well you made your bed
,I＇m in mine
,（Chorus）
,Because when I arrive
,I bring the fire
,Make you come alive

,We set drifting in search of fact.
,It seems indeed, life feels abstract.
,Several years with one faint sun.
,This last deft that holds no line.
,Making our way through time and space.
,Exploring all three to infinity.
,Suitcase is packed, flyin' free.
,Watching stars align, you came over time.
,All the while sippin' on some hibiscus tea.
,In dark of night a hope would shine,
,for us to find when we arrive.
,A radiant light, the river's kind,
,can get them now, but perhaps one time.
,Making our way through time and space.
,Exploring all three to infinity.
,Suitcase is packed, flyin' free.
,Watching stars align, you came over time.
,All the while..

,满怀忧伤却流不出泪
,极度的疲惫却不能入睡
,只能够日日夜夜 然后又日日夜夜
,无尽的日日夜夜 永远的深陷在人间
,我是蝙蝠却不能飞 困在日复一日的街
,无止尽的狩猎 彷佛一种天谴
,夜色就是我的披肩 日出就是我的风险
,舞池里的狂颠是我宿命制约
,上帝遗弃我们却又要给黯淡的月照亮世界
,要我们无尽又无情的繁衍
,看爱过的人一一告别
,做过的梦一一凋谢
,只留下我独自残喘的千年
,无法挥舞天使的纯洁
,也无法拥有魔鬼的果决
,只能像每个人类贪嗔痴傻和愚昧
,找寻着体温和血 找寻着同类
,满怀忧伤却流不出泪
,极度的疲惫却不能入睡
,只能够日日夜夜 然后又日日夜夜
,无尽的日日夜夜 永远的深陷在人间
,饥饿是最好的调味 孤独是最强的催眠
,疯狂找一双唇 能够当我酒杯
,早就对这一切厌倦 也曾愤怒喝下圣水
,却又无助醒在下个漫长黑夜
,青春遗忘我们却又要给回忆的美
,就像玫瑰要余生流血又流泪的受虐
,看镜中的脸慢慢枯萎 高举的拳渐渐粉碎
,只留下了无限唏嘘的相片
,无法挥舞天使的纯洁
,也无法拥有魔鬼的果决
,只有像每个人类贪嗔痴傻和愚昧
,找寻着体温和血 找寻着同类
,满怀忧伤却流不出泪
,极度的疲惫却不能入睡
,只能够日日夜夜 然后又日日夜夜
,无尽的日日夜夜 永远的深陷在人间
,我是蝙蝠却不能飞 困在日复一日的街

,总是在争论着谁对谁错 到头来没有意思的结果
,两个人心里都非常难过 一整夜挣扎着受尽折磨
,虽然我说但我却舍不得
,是什么让我们变的脆弱
,我用力跑向你 但你却要离开我
,为什么不明白 你为什么不明白我
,是我让你哭了 是你在最需要我的时候
,你却又原谅了 抬不起头看你的我
,我知道在此刻 什么话都不必再说
,不追究谁欠谁更多 相信只要还是你和我
,不在想知道是谁对谁错 管那些没有意义的结果
,不想让对方再一次的难过 我不要一整夜再受折磨
,虽然我说但我却舍不得
,是什么让我们变的脆弱
,我用力跑向你 你也用力跑向我
,相信你会明白我 这世界只有你明白我
,感谢上天让你认识了我
,不知我能给你带来什么
,感谢你从不会怀疑过我
,你让我不会再感到寂寞
,虽然我说但我却舍不得
,是爱情让我们变的脆弱
,我用力跑向你 你也用力跑向我
,相信你会明白我 这世界只有你明白我
,这世界只有你明白我

,很多时候你一个人习惯了
,就无法给与嘱托
,你习惯了如风般不结伴穿梭
,影子都没留片刻
,很多时候你一个人常常是
,只考虑一个人的
,你独舞喜怒哀乐任光阴如何
,任光阴如何收割
,你就是如此令人神往的角色
,在造物主的手中不拘一格
,锋利中带着柔和
,柔和里伴随冷落
,你就有如此不可多得的神色
,你每种表情无需费力把我俘获
,平静里带着谴责
,谴责却没有愠火
,很多时候你一个人厌倦了
,序列有秩的生活
,你厌倦同一班车被夕阳吞没
,却怨的不动声色
,很多时候你一个人就这么
,跳入了一扇沉默
,看起来属于陌生或属于暮色
,却不是属于谁的
,你就是如此令人神往的角色
,在造物主的手中不拘一格
,锋利中带着柔和
,柔和里伴随冷落
,你就有如此不可多得的神色
,你每种表情无需费力把我俘获

,平静里带着谴责
,谴责却没有愠火
,你告别该有的脆弱
,你放生无罪的困惑
,你沿着真心一路上
,化作未染的清澈

,信里面说 血癌已带走她
,但觉得空虚 的心仿佛已僵化

,夜雨中 似听到她说不要相约
,纵使分隔 相爱不会害怕

,我再也没有对你的秘密
,我决定我再也不会爱你
,因为你心已不在这里

,不知道要做些什么
,曾经的像流沙滑去

,偶尔还是会想起 说是不得而已
,才发现早已看不见你
,停驻的阴影冲散在狂风暴雨里
,对我给你的宽容总是有恃无恐
,我宁愿选择 放过自己
,同时放过你
,I'm sorry
,even though I still love you

,Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
,Some nights, I call it a draw
,Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
,Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

,His palms are sweaty' knees weak' arms are heavy
,There's vomit on his sweater already' mom's spaghetti
,He's nervous' but on the surface he looks calm and ready
,To drop bombs' but he keeps on forgettin
,What he wrote down' the whole crowd goes so loud
,He opens his mouth' but the words won'te out
,He's chokin' how everybody's jokin now
,The clock's run out' time's up over' bloah!
,Snap back to reality' Oh there goes gravity
,Oh' there goes Rabbit' he choked
,He's so mad' but he won't give up that
,Is he? No
,He won't have it ' he knows his whole back city's ropes
,It don't matter' he's dope
,He knows that' but he's broke
,He's so stacked that he knows
,When he goes back to his mobile home' that's when it's
,Back to the lab again yo
,This whole rhapsody
,He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
,You better lose yourself in the music' the moment

,This world is mine for the taking
,Make me king' as we move toward a' new world order
,A normal life is borin' but superstardom's close to post-mortem
,It only grows harder' only grows hotter
,He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
,Coast to coast shows' he's know as the globetrotter
,Lonely roads' God only knows
,He's grown farther from home' he's no father
,He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
,But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
,His bosses don't want him no mo' he's cold product

,Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
,All the pain inside amplified by the fact
,That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
,And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
,Cuz man' these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
,And it's no movie' there's no Mekhi Phifer' this is my life
,And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
,Tryin to feed and water my seed' plus
,See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna
,Baby mama drama's screamin on and
,Too much for me to wanna
,Stay in one spot' another jam or not
,Has gotten me to the point' I'm like a snail
,I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
,Success is my only mothafuckin option' failure's not
,Mom' I love you' but this trail has got to go
,I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
,So here I go is my shot.

Then I gotta do what i be coming here to do emobdy the beat they love the way we giving em a show
keys to the ignition and step on the gas
and bust a bottle and pour me shot in my glass
where we at where we at WHERE WE AT?
And we back up in the building and we coming with a scorcher
Yall already know who it is its Busta Bust and Travis Barker
Back to the beat T.B gotta go when we hit the fire trust everybody better know
That we bout to let it blow and we gotta get it yo, everybody if you really wit me
(Lets go)

Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go

I already spit it to the rhythm of the piano so now I gotta give the drummer some
Put the T up on the track will be phenomenal cuz when it come to havin a hit Imma have another one.
Blink 182 times when you the Twista with Travis, madness
Kinda like a savage, ravage a murderer with the art like blood on the canvas
and its kinda impeccable how I can spit and then get up in the middle with intricate patterns of a kick drum.
Diabolical, a lyrical flow that'll swallow you theoretical thinkin that you could get some.
Imma hit'em with the Lamborghini flow with the speed of a Bugatti

I'm from another planet when I spit a verse with the weed in my body. And Imma..
Hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth, sippin on the liquor 182 proof
Now they wanna say they should've never let me loose outta the cage like Imma see what I do
Its Twista the jace and the rap on the track, and hit cha with the Midwest flow
Even if you ain't ready yet, all I gotta say is ready set, (lets go)

Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go

Drive by, hit chu with the two piece combo while I'm hangin out the window of your Daddy's Lambo
Scramble eggs, I got scrambled ammo, leave you on top of the water like a banana boat
Yea I'm an animal, everybody's edible and Yelawolf is headed fo'your arm and your hand and yo…head, I'm a cannibal.
Good heavens the man's hopping over the fence like a fuckin antelope
SOOO, send it to me in a minute when you finish and ill put it in a vice grip
Put an end to the image and i'll send it to 'em via independent fuckin with the mic grill
I might slip and pull the trigger back in a submarine with a sub-machine loaded,
in an ocean, hot deep, deep enough to leave submarine imploded
Promenade mothafucker vamanosis, its me and I'm sick in the prog(a)nosis,
got more bars than Barney Fife and I'll put you behind them like howdy opie
I can make your mamma really proud to know me, and your broke daddy is down to loan me.
Gave me fifty bucks in penny rolls just to be in one of my videos yea homie lets go.

Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go
Hey, lets go, lets go, lets go

What you do, what you say
 Has a lot to do in how you live today
 What you want, and what you make,
 Everybody knows it's only what you take
 What you see, and what you hear,
 When it comes around again it's not too clear
 You say yes, they say no,
 Everybody's talking everywhere you go
You try to give another man a helping hand
 He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
 Never do to others what they do to you
 Try to find another way to make it through
What I say is what I know,
 Try to get a favour going from door to door
 You stop and pray it's out of style,
 You get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
 What I say is what I know
 Try to get a favour going from door to door
 You stop and pray, you know that's out of style,
 Get a step ahead it takes a hundred miles
You try to give another man a helping hand
 He will take your kindness for a weaker stand
 Never do to others what they do to you
 You'd better do it to them before they do it to you.
What you do, what you say

In a minute, darling, coming for us
FOR US
Summertime with no returning
TURNING
I don't wanna be that prisoner
I don't wanna get caught up again
Take me down and I'll keep breaking out
AND OUT
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
There's a man who's got something for you
FOR YOU
Come around and all your secrets
SECRETS
Trigger my things you need to heal
Holding on to broken souvenirs
Pull at strangers who start to reaper
APPEAR
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
And keep
I'll keep running
And keep
And you're still
And keep
Feel the river row
Come out, come out
Waken up to no one
Taking all the floor
Wishing I'm holding
Here on the floor
Waken up to no one
Taking all the floor
Wishing I'm holding
Here on the floor

カーテン越しに　白い光が
差し込む部屋で　座り込んでた
昨日の涙　あふれるばかりで
止まらずにいたけど
変わらずに　始まる朝
あたらしい1日は　谁にも访れるから
“やあ　おはよう”つぶやけば
少しずつ　笑颜になるよ
いままでの事　全てが消えた
はかなさを今　始めて知った
昨日の涙　あふれるばかりで


止め方も知らない
弱すぎる　私の手を
降り注ぐ太阳が　优しく照らしてくれた
暖かい日だまりに
包まれて　笑颜になるよ
いつだって　忘れない
愿いを胸に抱きしめ
明日へと　走り出そう
未来にいる　自分のために
あたらしい1日は　谁にも访れるから
“やあ　おはよう”つぶやけば
少しずつ　笑颜になるよ

,It starts with one thing
,I don't know why
,It doesn't even matter
,How hard you try
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme
,To explain in due time
,All I know
,Time is a valuable thing
,Watch it fly by
,As the pendulum swings
,Watch it count down
,To the end of the day
,The clock ticks life away
,It's so unreal
,Didn't look out below
,Watch the time go
,Right out the window
,Trying to hold on,
,But didn't even know
,Wasted it all just
,To watch you go
,I kept everything inside and
,Even though I tried,
,It all fell apart
,What it meant to me will
,Eventually be a
,Memory of a time when
,I tried so hard
,And got so far
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,I had to fall
,To lose it all
,But in the end
,It doesn't even matter
,One thing,
,I don't know why
,It doesn’t even matter
,How hard you try,
,Keep that in mind
,I designed this rhyme,
,To remind myself how
,I tried so hard
,In spite of the way
,You were mocking me
,Acting like I was
,Part of your property
,Remembering all the
,Times you fought with me

,I remembered black skies
,the lightning all around me
,I remembered each flash
,as time began to blur
,Like a startling sign
,that fate had finally found me
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
,Give me reason
,to fill this hole
,connect the space between
,Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
,Across this new divide
,There was nothing in sight
,but memories left abandoned
,There was nowhere to hide
,the ashes fell like snow
,And the ground caved in between where we were standing
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
,Across this new divide
,In every loss
,in every lie
,In every truth that you'd deny
,And each regret
,and each goodbye
,was a mistake to great to hide
,And your voice was all I heard
,That I get what I deserve
,So give me reason
,to prove me wrong
,to wash this memory clean
,Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

,Prelude
,The eagle born to those who pledged their lives and sacred honor
,Was smiled upon by God and freed from chains and iron collar
,He is held aloft on unity and by history revered
,For preserving peace through strength
,His wings now reach across two hundred years
,But for each of those and one year more
,God has smiled upon The Corps
,From the Barbary Coast to the Eastern Sand
,By sword, by gun, or by bare hand
,So it's been, and shall be weighed:
,Though many are born, few are "made"
,Faithful Always, they shall remain
,Dogs to loose when war is waged
,
,I am a Marine on the beach
,I'm a killin' machine
,With a need to bleed you when the light goes green
,Best believe, I'm in a zone to be
,From my Yin to my Yang to my Yang Tze
,Put a grin on my chin, come to me
,'cuz I'll win, I'm one-of-a-kind and I'll bring death
,To the place you're about to be:
,Another river of blood runnin' under my feet
,Forged in a fire lit long ago
,Stand next to me, you'll never stand alone
,I'm last to leave, but the first to go
,Hard Corps is the only way I know
,I feed on the fear of the devil inside of the enemy faces in my sights:
,Aim with the hand, shoot with the mind, kill with a heart like arctic ice
,I am a Devil-Dog I’m marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,I bask in the glow of the rising war,
,Lay waste to the ground of an enemy shore
,Wade through the blood spilled on the floor
,And if another one stands I’ll kill some more
,Bullet in the breech and a fire in me
,Like a cigarette thrown to gasoline
,If death don't bring you fear then death ain't brought by no Marine
,Come to the nightmare, come to me
,Deep down in the dark where the devil be
,In the maw with the jaws and the razor teeth
,Where the brimstone burns and the angel weeps
,Call to the gods if I cross your path and my silhouette hangs like a body bag
,Hope is a moment now long past, the shadow of death is the one I cast
,I am a Devil-Dog I'm marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Hell has no demon I won't overcome
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,For over 221 years our Corps has done two things for this great Nation
,We make Marines, and we win battles
,Never forget that!
,You are the first Marines
,And not all the Communists in hell can overrun you!
,Now I live lean and I mean to inflict the grief
,And the least of me is still out of your reach
,The killing machine's gonna do the deed　
,Until the river runs dry and my last breath leaves
,Chin in the air with a head held high
,I'll stand in the path of the enemy line
,Feel no fear, know my pride
,For God and Country I'll end your life
,I am a Devil-Dog I'm marching on
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Hell has no demon I won't overcome
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,I made the devil himself turn and run
,I am a warrior and this is my song
,Into the fire I will keep marchin' on
,Oorah, Marine Corps, Get Some...

,Vielä eilen hetki sitten
,Olin suuri kuin jättiläinen
,Suuresta suusta suureen ääneen
,Lausuin sanoja, huusin ääneen
,Sanoja siitä, mitä mieltä
,Olen teistä ja teidän töistä
,Puhuin puolesta, puolesta maan
,Joka jalkojen alla upottaa
,Kuuta katson, kuka sen omistaa
,Kenen on taivas, kenen on tämä maa
,Kenen kehtoa kalma keinuttaa
,Kenen toimesta me täällä kuljetaan
,Kuuta katson, kuka sen omistaa
,Kenen on taivas, kenen on tämä maa
,Kenen kehtoa kalma keinuttaa
,Kenen toimesta me täällä kuljetaan
,Mätäs mättäältä, metri metriltä
,vaivun maahan, maahan vetiseen
,Täällä on turhaa, turha on huutaa
,sillä täällä ei sanoja kuulla
,Nämä linnut laulavat minulle
,kertovat siitä, kuinka on pientä
,elo yhden, yhden ihmisen
,Sillä tämä maa on ikuinen
,Kuuta katson, kuka sen omistaa
,Kenen on taivas, kenen on tämä maa
,Kenen kehtoa kalma keinuttaa

,对这个世界如果你有太多的抱怨
,跌倒了就不敢继续往前走
,为什麽人要这麽的脆弱 堕落
,请你打开电视看看
,多少人为生命在努力勇敢的走下去
,我们是不是该知足
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡
,随着稻香河流继续奔跑
,微微笑 小时候的梦我知道
,不要哭让萤火虫带着你逃跑
,乡间的歌谣永远的依靠
,回家吧 回到最初的美好
,不要这麽容易就想放弃 就像我说的
,追不到的梦想 换个梦不就得了
,为自己的人生鲜艳上色 先把爱涂上喜欢的颜色
,笑一个吧 功成名就不是目的
,让自己快乐快乐这才叫做意义
,童年的纸飞机 现在终於飞回我手里
,所谓的那快乐 赤脚在田里追蜻蜓追到累了
,偷摘水果被蜜蜂给叮到怕了 谁在偷笑呢
,我靠着稻草人吹着风唱着歌睡着了
,哦 哦 午后吉它在虫鸣中更清脆
,哦 哦 阳光洒在路上就不怕心碎
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡
,随着稻香河流继续奔跑
,微微笑 小时候的梦我知道
,不要哭让萤火虫带着你逃跑
,乡间的歌谣永远的依靠

,人家都说 帅 酷 美
,唉～真的是

,活着不好吗 为什么要捡98k
,除了神仙那一挂没人能抢我的首杀位
,最讨厌那些伏地魔 出门必备平底锅
,不仅打法猥琐 而且还tm的行李多
,全程缩圈摸毒边 厕所是他的根据地
,从没胆子亭亭玉立 凉的时候万念俱寂
,在尖刀队眼里吃鸡就像联手驭蝗虫
,想给某类人体描边大师点首夕阳红
,别再发微信 给我八倍镜 化身钓鱼执法官
,那些愣头青 还敢瞪流星 看我把他屎打穿

,拥有着后知后觉的美丽
,来不及感谢
,是你给我勇气 让我能做回我自己
,
,也许当时
,忙着微笑和哭泣
,忙着追逐天空中的流星
,人理所当然的忘记是谁
,风里 雨里 一直默默守护在原地
,
,原来你是 我最想留住的幸运
,原来我们 和爱情曾经靠得那么近
,那为我对抗世界的决定 那陪我淋的雨
,一幕幕都是你 一尘不染的真心
,与你相遇 好幸运
,可我也失去 为你泪流满面的权利
,但愿在我看不到的天际
,你张开了双翼 遇见你的注定
,她会有多幸运

,有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
,在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
,可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你
,留下的只有带着你味道的一封信
,就在昨天还一起看我们的照片
,可现在让我感觉像烂剧里的主演
,为什么这种事情会发生在我身边
,是不是老天没能看到对你的疯癫

,离开我 开始新的起点
,可能我 还会对你贪恋
,谁让你 曾今让我疯癫
,疯癫 那也是过去的画面
,看往后的几天 我猜测你不会出现
,我回想这几年 就像是要命的病变
,你可能听不见 来自他Cubi的挂念
,可能有点累 觉得对不对这是第几次为你宿醉
,没了我肩膀 你在谁身旁买的礼物变成了灰
,曾今我多想 把你变漂亮看着别人羡慕你的模样
,没关系有小熊陪Cubi看月亮
,我已经看到跟你断电的过程 但我假装看不见
,是不是要我变得像个厉鬼才能进入你的世界
,为什么不说再见 我猜你这次应该是不小心的忘记
,都无所谓也有点累也可以开始新的记忆

,And I could walk for days
,Searching for your praise
,But is it even there to find?
,Is there a chance for me to lend your memories?
,Will I slowly lose my mind?
,Lost in your maze
,Stuck in your gaze
,How can I get out?
,I'm out of time to make you mine

,Or visting cemeteries on holidays
,I just wanna drift away
,From all the pain that we feelin'
,Man, it's been ten years
,Since Chris died, I'm still healin'

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time
,The Void had been pushed back before by the power of mortals.
,The gods couldn’t do it,but maybe we can.
,What can yet be blessed can yet be restored.
,One way or another, divinity will survive.
,Divinity will survive...
,The gods are dead,long live the Godwoken.
,You have already unleashed some powers left within you, but there is the great well of possibility still untapped.
,You cannot stop until you ascend to the highest heights of your power.
,You cannot stop until you become divine.
,It is not the work effete,It is the work of devoid
,I am bound, but not defeated.
,Not yet...
,Until become divine
,Divine～
,Until become divine
,Divinity will survive
,Divinity will survive
,The Godwoken were alive, but what of the gods?

,Money is not evil by itself

作词 : Freese, Muggerud, Reyes
chorus：
(b real)
So you wanna be a rap/rock superstar, and live large
A big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world, don't trust no body
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
B real:
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
Looking in the mirror, dreamin about blowin up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honeys
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
It's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin with it
Nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you dont know
About the blood, sweat and tears
And losing some of your fears
And losing some of yourself to the years past,
Gone by
Hopefully it dont manifest
For the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Dont know how to act
48 tracks
Studio gangster, mack,
Sign the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will til he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap/rock superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who dont know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some cant pay the way
Still trapped in what you rapping about
Tell me what happened when you lost
The route you took started collapsing
No fans no fame no respect no change no women
And everybody shittin on your name
Chrous x2
Sen: (only in rock version)
You ever have big dreams of making real cream
Big shot, heavy hitter on the main
And you wanna look trendy
In the bentley, be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happends to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be ok
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my lex with chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far
And live large
It aint all that goes with bein a rock star
Chorus x2
B real:
My own son dont know me
I'm chillin in the hotel room lonely
But i thank god i'm with my homies
But sometimes i wish i was back home
But only no radio or video didnt show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
I'm in the middle like mony
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight, never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the paladium (a venu in la)
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the ho's roll on
Til the next rap/rock superstar
With no shame
Give em a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin ignored, i warned him
Assured him, this aint easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin people (gun cock noise)
Whispered: assassins, assassins
Chorus x2

,But I love the way that you move

,我知道 我做的不对
,我总是喜欢说说
,对不起 我欠你太多的怀抱
,总是觉得工作太忙
,常常被冷眼灼伤
,对不起 总是让你受委屈
,人和人总是有差距
,日子里总要遇难题
,总是盼望太多 最后如不如意都被时间浇熄
,哦 Baby 你说你不是很在意
,多想和你游遍世界
,那样活着才有意义
,我知道你和我都不喜欢逃避
,时光拿走了你的美丽
,岁月带走了我的脾气
,对不起 我还欠你一场婚礼
,说着说着 我又开始不切实际
,说着说着 我就醉在了你的怀里
,三十岁的眼泪还流有青春余味
,爱情是否能解除生活的狼狈
,别要求太多 学着时间一样洒脱
,哦 Baby 我性格不是这样的
,婚姻会不会让我们感到乏味
,那么就这样 不去理睬这浮躁的社会
,既然无法长大 那就不要学着别人去挣扎
,哦 Baby 但愿我们能相随
,既然无法长大 那就不要学着别人去挣扎
,哦 Baby 但愿我们能相随
,我知道我做的不对
,我只是有些疲惫

,昨天晚上我梦见你
,你没有说话
,你启动你的唇
,我尝试著阅读
,梦却被海水灌满
,我看得见你在流泪
,可是泪在海水中
,显得不清楚
,当浮力消退
,故事 就降落成真实
,越过河流 遇见荒野
,你是否成为你想要的样子
,越过冬天 来到了海边
,听你静静说 「别醒来」

,Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
,Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
,Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
,Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
,Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
,Empecemos lento, después salvaje
,Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
,Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
,Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
,Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
,Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
,Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
,Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
,Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
,¡Oye!
,Despacito
,Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
,Deja que te diga cosas al oído
,Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
,Despacito
,Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
,Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
,Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
,(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)
,Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
,Quiero ser tu ritmo
,Que le enseñes a mi boca
,Tus lugares favoritos
,(Favorito, favorito, baby)
,Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
,Hasta provocar tus gritos
,Y que olvides tu apellido
,Despacito
,This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
,I just wanna hear you screaming, "¡Ay, Bendito!"
,I can move foreverm se quede contigo
,¡Bailalo!
,Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
,Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
,Que le enseñes a mi boca
,Tus lugares favoritos

,Take me now, baby, here as I am
,Hold me close, and try and understand
,Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
,Love is a banquet on which we feed
,Come on now, try and understand
,The way I feel when I need your hand
,Take my hand, come under cover
,They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
,Because the night belongs to lovers
,Because the night belongs to love
,Because the night belongs to lovers
,Because the night belongs to us
,Have I a doubt, when I'm alone
,Love is a ring on the telephone
,Love is an angel, disguised as lust
,Here in our bed 'til the morning comes
,Come on now, try and understand
,The way I feel, under your command
,Take my hand, and the sun resets

,Been away for college, was the baddest geek around
,He's been doing everything but make his parents proud
,He tried his best to study hard but still, he got too drunk
,Won lots of beer pong tournaments but still, he had to flunk
,His ex-girlfriend got a girlfriend
,His barbie tried a female Ken
,But when the white ball hits the red cup
,He's the baddest fucker in the frat club
,Then he does the pong dance
,The the the the pong dance
,He does the pong dance
,The the the the pong dance
,
,He'd never touched a cigarette,but tried to smoke a joint
,He coughed and soon he felt regret
,Just screaming "What's the point?!"
,And every time he saw this girl his face would turn to red
,Even though he told the guys he got her into bed
,But when you see him at the table
,He turns out to be rather stable
,And when the white ball hits the red cup
,He's the baddest fucker in the frat club
,Then he does the pong dance
,Then he does the pong dance

,Моя жизнь мама, как черно-белое кино
,Все вроде бы неплохо, но всегда есть одно "НО"

,В поисках ответа, в поисках пути
,Я собираю все силы и продолжаю идти
,За все прости меня, Мама, я был во многом виноват
,Но все осталось в прошлом - время не вернуть назад
,Пытаюсь встать с колен, немного приподняться
,Но что-то мне мешает от земли оторваться
,Молюсь.. Дай мне сил Боже понять, что меня тревожит, кто мне поможет
,Быть может, Боже, моя вера слаба, но где бы я не был я помню эти слова
,Прости за то, что я тебе их редко говорю: МАМА Я ТЕБЯ ЛЮБЛЮ!

,这一路上走走停停 顺着少年漂流的痕迹
,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打
,-M-
,短短的路走走停停 也有了几分的距离
,不知抚摸的是故事 还是段心情
,也许期待的不过是 与时间为敌
,再次看到你 微凉晨光里 笑的很甜蜜
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜

,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,-=-
,晚风吹起你鬓间的白发 抚平回忆留下的疤 你的眼中 明暗交杂 一笑生花
,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话
,我仍感叹于世界之大 也沉醉于儿时情话 不剩真假 不做挣扎 无谓笑话
,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了
,以爱之名 你还愿意吗

,原来我和你的世界
, 隔着暧昧的黑夜
, 你的爱不是我要的那一种亲切
, 等时间让我能了解
, 寻找另一种体贴
, 出口在天亮以前
, 我就要穿过那条街
, 沉默加速度是我的脚步
, 奔跑在视线里的路
, 我不要祝福不理会孤独
, 奔向最远处
,
, 眼光若能坚定一些
, 就不会在乎那一切
, 不值得爱就拒绝
, 就将他忽略
, 前面的路就算重叠
, 那也是我要的世界
, 我不会笑的轻蔑
, 不随便对谁说感谢
, 沉默加速度是我的脚步
, 奔跑在视线里的路
, 我不要祝福不理会孤独

,你的回头 划伤了沉默
,那夜重逢 停止漂泊 你曾回来过
,相濡相忘 都是疼痛

, Un par de enamorados
, Flechados, cansados
, Sudor desenfrenado
, Cuando tú y yo nos juntamos
, Sin piedad (Aquí no aguantamos)
, Nos damos
, Cuando hacemos el amor
, Amor, amor, amor
, Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
, Cuando hacemos el amor
, Amor, amor, amor
, Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo
, La la la eh, el sudor en tu piel
, A mí me vuelves loco
, Tus besos saben a miel
, Ahora, eh!
, Quiero tu desnudez
, A mí si tú te vuelves lo hacemos otra vez
, Cuando se pone el babydoll ¡Uf, arrasa!
, Una copa de vino y tumba la casa
, No sé qué me pasa
, Pero cuando me abrasa
, Con su fuego me traspasa
, Y en el medio de la cama se entrega
, Siempre pa' alante
, Sabe como se breva
, Y se pega, se pega
, Cuando hacemos el amor
, Amor, amor, amor
, Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
, Cuando hacemos el amor
, Amor, amor, amor

, Tenemos la fortuna
, De perder el control
, Se oculta la luna
, Cuando sale el sol
, Se pierde mi blusa
, Y tu pantalón
, Suma la cama
, Resta la ropa
, Bésame rico
, Vuélveme loca
, Así, así, así
, Así, así, así
, Sabes a cielo
, Hueles a gloria
, Dame la vida y la victoria
, Así, así, así
, Así
, Yo quiero hacértelo lento
, Tu cuerpo
, Fluyendo así como el viento
, Sin mezclar los sentimientos
, Bien lento, muy lento (muy lento)
, Para aprovechar el tiempo, contigo bebé (¡JLo!)
, Cuando hacemos el amor

,There is sadness in your eyes
,I don't wanna say goodbye to you
,Love is one big illusion
,I should try to forget
,But there is something left in my head
,
,我不要你的呵护 你的玫瑰
,只要你好好久久爱我一遍
,就算虚荣也好 贪心也好
,哪个女人对爱不自私 不奢望
,我不要你的承诺 不要你的永远
,只要你真真切切爱我一遍
,就算虚荣也好 贪心也好
,最怕你把沉默 当做对我的回答
,很谦卑 只不过是我太过爱你
,连自尊都忘记
,跌到极麻木 只好相信
,又再爬得起
,就会有转机
,若我不懂憎你 如何离别你
,亦怕不会飞
,谁来爱我 小心爱错 以免彼此无助
,还能热恋谁 谁能受得起那么多 为何拿着我消磨
,谁来爱我 请好好对我 犹如拿捏着星火
,认真的我 花开了总想结果 才令你闪身掠过
,他的爱意反复改变我
,也许相恋得太多
,人亦渐渐不知对错
,天生孤单过距再上路也不清楚
,要看得清楚却不心需要那点恋火
,And I will always love you !
,I will always love you !
,I will always love you !
,I will always love! you !

,She thinks the devil will come tonight
,There is nothing I can take pride in
,Because I have lost the prime of my life
,Thin boy thinks that I should not be sad
,I will try my best to win the rest of my life
,
,I do it but you think a fat boy
,can be fit more than I can
,
,There is something wrong with my head
,It cause I am different with anybody
,When I try to think about you in my head
,The memory is so sick that I should come back

,我们长得不漂亮，也不会化妆
,来到陌生的地方，找个角落躲藏
,我们带来的干粮，就要被吃光
,谁说这里是天堂，天堂我们做梦也在想
,天上怎么这个样！
,
,街上我们在游荡，怀揣着梦想
,你慈爱的眼光，叫我好想躲藏
,我像一块泡泡糖，甜得让你想尝
,他会慢慢膨胀膨胀，尽管早已不再甜
,我们已开始不能阻挡
,我们都天生要幸福，从天黑追到天亮
,有了自己的地方，会找到自己的伪装
,没有人再躲藏，也没人再怀疑天堂
,我们的大工厂，使我们变得漂亮
,我们离开家乡，倒像梦想
,各位漆黑的脸庞，别忘了小池塘
,我们依然不漂亮，可是化了妆
,我们盖了工厂工厂，还生了小儿郎
,他们一出生就漂亮
,
,哒踢踢啦踢踢，从天黑唱到天亮
,到处是玩的地方，从来不需要的伪装
,哒踢踢啦踢踢，一出生就在天上
,如果你也有工厂，就和我们一样漂亮
,放开我手中回忆的刀子
,现在我已被风景都穿透
,打开这本书他已经在这里
,沉入阴影谁能拯救我
,离开城市了
,沿着河奔跑着
,古老的光线
,再不能照亮
,远方的雷声低沉在飘着
,身上的雨水是恋人的眼泪
,想念这绝望又温柔的片刻
,要说再见不能再见
,离开城市了
,沿着河奔跑着
,古老的光线
,再不能照亮
,这世界是一个谜语
,我们谁也不想去解开
,是为了要拯救自己
,却成了别人的天使
,远方的雷声低沉在飘着
,身上的雨水是恋人的眼泪
,想念这绝望又温柔的片刻
,要说再见不能再见
,不再回头

,饮醉不止马匹

,唔…
,从未情欲而得体
,不甘果腹，所以菩提
,攀缘不得

,吞咽子弹与潮汐
,不断出离再凋敝于
,世道的阴影里
,温柔地枯寂
,为眼前四季屏息
,不解自由，然后自缢
,自然没有目的
,时间所赋予
,从未流动而具体
,一如孤独所有赋予
,从未存在深意

,依稀仿佛雨絲 不會知道你有意或無意
,人入場滿懷失意時 你便會悲哀中再共我相依
,就是傷心一次又一次 為你獻上多一次夢兒
,沒法解釋多一次 仿似困難錯誤故事
,
,深刻不可悔改 只會等偶爾你過問憐愛
,彷徨時你如風到來 我預算不多久最後再分開
,就是多少給予或慷慨 自我哄騙的燦爛未來
,令我不想多感慨 只有抱怨愛你是意外
,從不應沒有自尊 只是一廂意願
,朦朧人生欠缺預算 教我視野樸素因你意亂
,從不應被作弄看穿 心被思憶壟斷
,情人離開擦過便算 為何令我憂亂
,也為何公眾道別沒有間斷

,昨夜她光着脚 独自跳华尔兹 远处的教堂在唱诗
,壁炉里的火焰 早已经熄灭 湖畔野水仙已凋谢
,月光像颗糖 醉又何妨 自怜又自伤 镜中模样
,清醒也唤不回 那些回忆 再也唤不回 那些回忆
,这世界有太多灰姑娘 身世平凡也不太漂亮
,爱的卑微没有声响 向往温暖 却只等到凄凉
,清晨的鸽子 飞进了城堡 钟声呜咽又到离别
,山林中的精灵 都沉默不语 风过雪松低声唏嘘
,别再伤心 亲爱的人 如果当真 只会伤的更深
,纵使今夜 穿上水晶鞋 这场聚会也 只是为了告别
,这世界有太多灰姑娘 身世平凡也不太漂亮
,爱的卑微没有声响 向往温暖 却只等到凄凉
,谁愿意去做灰姑娘 假面王子看不到善良
,真心不该为他受伤 无需华美衣裳 你有你的光芒
,Oh your love is a song, your love is a song

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,每一天都期待能和你见面
,你的爱是我曾经吸到肺里的烟
,剪不断那刻骨铭心的纠缠
,这是我 改变不了的永远
,十一年是我最遥远的从前
,想起我刚看到你当初的第一眼
,那一天已藏在我的心里面
,把思念改变成信念
,爱还会不会重来
,手握着褪色的照片
,就算不能再续写前缘
,仍想回到十一年之前
,独自走在相识的地点
,往事再次划过了心弦
,如今的我丢了纯真的笑脸
,现在的你添了成熟的容颜
,可是承诺已超过了期限
,让它埋藏苦涩的十一年
,是你是我理不清的相欠
,算了 爱在心里面
,你是否会为我的真爱而改变
,期待着 回到我身边的一瞬间
,也多想 再次走在相识的地点
,找回我 消失的爱恋
,十一年是我最遥远的从前
,想起我刚看到你当初的第一眼
,那一天已藏在我的心里面
,把思念改变成信念

,仍想回到十一年之前
,我 再找不到从前
,一瞬间看到你的脸
,就在半梦我半醒之间
,仿佛回到十一年之前
Her tarafmı satılır acaba böyle parsa parsa

Hasat zamanı gel beach
Rape bi paha biç
Rapime paha biçme
Trip yapma git p*ç
Çok ufaksın ancak hiç relaxın kalmamış
Silahsız olmaz sanma
Vinç al öyle yüksel ah hiç...
Hedefim old on
Hedefim hep on
Önüme pinpon topu gibi düşerce son
Bende gizli bak
Öyle durma kalk
Haydi yak ateşin ak kalmamışmı bak
Ak düştü saçlarımdan
Her taraf dumanlı puslu sisli
Her tarafta gizli suçlar her bir yerde gizli
Gizli mermiler bu kelimelerdir övgün
cümlelerdir
Akla alan aklı parlatan
Sen yaylan
Kamer dolunca kurtadammı olunabilir
Fakat ben her zaman varım
Yazım kışım karım
Üsküdar'da olacak aklı bağlayışlar
Aklı alabilirse alsın
Yedi tepeyse İstanbul bırakın öyle kalsın

Asılmışsın basbatı
Altındasın apası
Kasmasın bu asrın aslı
Dedikoduyla savaşa gireneceksen
Kasımpatı tarlasında kamera karşısında
Yükselen cesaret taklalarda makyajlarda gizli
Üsküdar stil bu müpteziri madara yetti
Anlat derdi
Sokaklar hem cehennem hemde cennet
olabilirmi
Bilmem ancak ve de fiziksel ihtilal var
Doğdum hep duvardı büyüdüm hala daha
duvar var
Hergün kavga gördüm kiminde korku kiminde
kanlar
Gerçek gecekondularmı yoksa şu mezarlar
Nazarlı bakmış gözler bence hep yalandan

Ben Ağlamazken
Ben ağlamazken açıldı perde düştü maskem ve ağlamazken dert üşüştü
Oldu mesken bana dünya zevk ü sefa içinde kaldım her zaman ben
Mengenem bu evren her zaman dar her halukarda kara geçtim
Her zaman gülen ben oldum asla bakmadım ki arkama ben emri verdim
Onlar yaptılar silahla kimde para var anne onunla güldüm
Emme mezara girdim öncem akıllandım sandı nafile
Ben ağlamazken her sebeple güldüm insanoğlu kardeşim hep ölmüş
Her zaman savaş felaket herbir yerde bana ne beşibiryerde olsun isterim
Ben hiçte dalmam derde...
Ben ağlamazken açıldı perde düştü maskem ve ağlamazken
Herkes üzgün herkes elden bir şey gelir diye şşş bekleyişler
Haremde curcunam çok hadi naş ben ağlamazken...
Ben ağlamazken havada savaşın rüzgarlarımı esiyor acaba
Ancak başta söyleyeyim bu sancak devrilmez salıncak koptu
Zincirlendi idealizm hep sınırlı kaldı faydasız kararla hep karardı tarlalar
Sarayda kaldı naralar değerli oldu mağralar
Genç yaşta göz yuman bu yaşama ikinci hak yok
Yaş sınırı yok karaca ahmet kapıda bekler rahmet çok
Çoğumuz aç ve çoğumuz tok onbinlerce foık ihanet etti ademe
Cümle aleme bu rapte isyanım var medcezir var ey ademoğlu nefsimiz köreldi
Tospembe bakmadık bu dünyaya ve ecel ağlamazken geldi...
Resmedil ve resmol kansız rap bu tek yol gördüğüm bu herşey hep rol
Varsa yoksa petrol kaybeder her despot underground da yektik hem efekttik
Renkli dünyamızda yok güneş kaybettik bu hastalıklar epidemik
Mikropsa diplomalı bir program işte problem burada akademik hologram
Kaç kilogram edebilir bu progressive deneyler hadi ordan andımızmı vardı
Karlı yoldan geçmeyi biz seçmedik bu buzlar eriyecektir elbet
Bir gün gelir savaşlar aynı tablolarla ağlatır diken ve gül çok ağlamış bu dünya bahçesinde
Dağlanır bu gözler barış yalan savaşsa gerçek savaşma gerzek anlaşmış herkes
Dayanmış hançer kafanda mavzer önünde panzer mezarsa mahzen
Felaketi bir bilsen istemezdin erken vakit gelir melek alır canı ben ağlamazken...
Ben ağlamazken açıldı perde düştü maskem ve ağlamazken
Herkes üzgün herkes elden bir şey gelir diye şşş bekleyişler
Haremde curcunam çok hadi naş ben ağlamazken...

,
Bu hayra
Alamet olmayan bir Track, sizin için bu türküler pespaye hale gelmiş
Sayfalarsa isyanlarda, mantıklı cümleler bir araya gelememiş
Ve misyonerler bu pervasız isteyişler
Sizin eseriniz kasımda aşk bir başka
Şu anda proloterden, kulağına titreşimler, emitasyon, vaadler
Hepsi sizden ve mikrofona haram kusan bu ceddin torununa zehirli zemzem
Veren dervişerden, bıkan dertli gençlik, ölmek bile parayla
Parayla satın alınan bu toprağa gömülmek haram
Yaran derin tamam kanar, yarım kalan talan sabır taşında eritilir
Zaman kayan bir yıldız, atmosferse bendim
Sistem etkilendi, sisten ertelendi bizden
Gelen fikirler dayanaksız, teori çürütür
Siyah çiçekler çoksa eğer, korkun ölümün günüdür

,
Panorama harem, felsefemin, yeni penceresi, bana pense verin
Dişleri sökülecek serserinin. Bu size olacaktır, son seferim
Söyle yeni jenerasyon, çokmu mutlu sence?
Çok konuşma, rezil oldun, hepsi mutsuz bence
Anahtar olmuş her bakışta kara para pençe
Hançer saplanmış bu kalbe fayda etmez akçe
Bana bir baksın, beni bir görsün, beni bir duysun dostlar
Doğru yoldan çıktınızsa ecel kolay toslar
Gemide kaptan olsun, karada boktan olsun ister
Sisler hiçte bitmez insanoğlu hep yer ister

,
Günahla ekilen tohum
Kabusla irkilen toplum
Ne yaptınız bu gençlik için ha tarihle övünün!
Dövündük her, ölümün her, yenilginin ardından
Alınan ders ne kader bela başımdan eksik olmaz
Balıkmı baştan koktu, yoksa balığın başımı koptu?
Balığın başına geleni pişmiş aşına bakta gör
Sence bir ömrün sonumudur asitli mide?
Içinde bok taşır bu insan söyle, bu kibir kime
Niye kime kısmet, kime niyet namzet
Bekler benden, ama sahte gülüş ifaden mimiklerin
İstanbul bu, vahadaki sarayı liriklerin hepsi çalışacak
Hepsi başaracak bu bebeklerin

Fark Var
(Nakarat)
Fark var seninle iyi arasında büyük bir,
fark var benimle senin aranda kocaman bir,
fark var kötüyle benim aramda irice bir,
fark var iyiyle kötü arasında duran
Maymunlar cehennemindeyim, hiç kimse duymamış,
sordum hiç kimse görmemiş ve hiç kimse konuşmamış,
korkular dolup taşınca komşularda kalmamış,
yalancı şahitler çoğalmış, ordularda saf almış,
sanki herkes zan altında, pozisyon sert penaltı,
yeraltından çıktım ben çoktan fareydim çok yol aldım,
korktum bazen bende herkes gibi umudum kalmadı,
fakat sabrımsa aramızdaki en büyük farktır,
gönlüm kavga etmek istemez bıktım da zaten,
çelimsizlerle uğraşıp, şaşırmışa laf anlatmak,
beyinsizlerle sohbetler, gereksizlere öğütler,
bakışlardan bellidir kim ne ister, niyetse nedir,
orda kimse yok mu hadi biraz ses ver,
burada ben sıkıldım yaklaş bana el ver,
eninde sonunda görüşeceğiz elbet,
şimdilik benden bu kadar iyi bu mesafe
(Nakarat)
Fark var seninle iyi arasında büyük bir,
fark var benimle senin aranda kocaman bir,
fark var kötüyle benim aramda irice bir,
fark var iyiyle kötü arasında duran
iyice havaya gir havaya gir iyice,
ben yorulmam kondisyonum top ta dj,
sahnede büyülerim tam bir buçuk saat,
seyirciyle birleşir bir bütün oluruz o an,
gözünü kapat ve dinle bence en azından,
yüzde yüz gerçek ve canlı çokta rahatız burada,
gönlünü sen hoş tut, olacaksın hoşnut,
boşluklar dolar yavrum biz boşuna mı koştuk,
ayrılmış birbirinden millet, hep uzak blok blok,
sallandıkça kendinden geçmiş sınıflar hep tok,
yeni moda glock, bizde ise barış stok,
yanlış söyler horoskop ve vakitsiz ötmüş horoz,
festivaller özgürlük, barış demekti n’oldu,
insanoğlu İstanbul’da bu kuralı bozdu,
neyse bizim işimiz çok dinlemek ve eğlenmek,
dinletmek ve eğlemek gerek beklerler çünkü bizde
(Nakarat)
Fark var seninle iyi arasında büyük bir,
fark var benimle senin aranda kocaman bir,
fark var kötüyle benim aramda irice bir,
fark var iyiyle kötü arasında duran
uzaklaştıkça uzaklaşır insanlar yabancılaştı,
ortamlar yabanileşti, kelamlar acayipleşti,
saygıysa çölde bir yerde her dilde bir aşk şarkısı,
kördüğümle düğümlenen yollarda arkadaşlıklar,
eğlenmekte şart biraz, kafa dağılmadan oynanmaz,
her gün bayram olmaz ancak arada bir coşmak farz,
kuruntulardan kurtulmak, kırıntılarla kalmamak,
yosun tutan bir kimse değil de ışığı parlayan olmak,
sen sıkma canını ben buradayım her daim,
coşturmak için hazır gönüllerde yer varsa,
geldiğim yerdeyim, elimde kağıt kalemim,
elimde açık kartlarım ve elimde ki mikrofonla

,And so I cry sometimes
,When I'm lying in bed
,Just to get it all out
,What's in my head
,And I am,I am feeling a little peculiar
,And so I wake in the morning
,And I step outside
,And I take a deep breath and I get real high
,And I scream at the top of my lungs
,What's going on?
,And I say, hey hey hey hey

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field

,I can't believe the things that happen to me
,I guess that I should have seen a long, long time ago
,Letters you write don't help me get through the night
,So I'll just turn out the light
,And sleep here all alone
,All the love, all the love in the world
,All the love, I'll be sending you girl
,All the love
,All the love in the world
,Time after time I put my life on the line
,But I ain't committed no crime, so take what you can find
,Forget what I say 'cause I'll keep running away
,I only live for today, but I'm one day behind
,These are the words that I whisper on every first night
,But that day you left me

,She's got a smile that it seems to me
,Reminds me of childhood memories
,Where everything
,Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
,Now and then when I see her face
,She takes me away to that special place
,And if I stared too long
,I'd probably break down and cry
,Sweet child o' mine
,Sweet love of mine
,She's got eyes of the bluest skies
,As if they thought of rain
,I hate to look into those eyes
,And see an ounce of pain
,Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
,Where as a child I'd hide
,And pray for the thunder
,And the rain
,To quietly pass me by

,Sweet love of mine

,You don’t think you need it
,And old friends are just a chore'

,Take care of your soul
,Take care of your soul
,How high' how low' how on your own

,And all those friends that were such a chore
,You’re gonna need them more than ever before
,All that glitter and all that gold
,Won’t buy you happy
,When you’ve been bought and sold
,Riding white horses' you can’t control

,
,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,
,(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
,Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing

,I, oh I, oh I
,I, so high, so high
,Oh, angel sent from up above
,You know you make my world light up
,When I was down, when I was hurt
,You came to lift me up
,Life is a drink, and love's a drug
,Oh, now I think I must be miles up
,When I was a river, dried up
,You came to rain a flood
,I, oh, I, oh
,Got me feeling drunk and high
,So high, so high
,I, oh, I, oh, I, oh
,Now I'm feeling drunk and high
,So high, so high
,
,Oh, angel sent from up above
,I feel it coursing through my blood
,Life is a drink, your love's about
,To make the stars come out
,Drink for me, drink for me
,Pour on a symphony
,When I'm low, low, low, low
,I, oh I, oh I
,Got me feeling drunk and high
,So high, so high

,Now and then I think of when we were together
,Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
,Told myself that you were right for me
,But felt so lonely in your company
,But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
,
,You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
,Like resignation to the end always the end
,So when we found that we could not make sense
,Well you said that we would still be friends
,But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,You didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,
,Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
,But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
,And I don't wanna live that way
,Reading into every word you say
,You said that you could let it go
,And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
,Somebody that you used to know
,But you didn't have to cut me off
,Make out like it never happened
,And that we were nothing
,And I don't even need your love
,But you treat me like a stranger
,And that feels so rough
,No,you didn't have to stoop so low
,Have your friends collect your records
,And then change your number
,I guess that I don't need that though
,Now you're just somebody that I used to know
,somebody I used to know

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose
,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing

,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me (A rhapsody for you and me)
,And every melody is timeless
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?

,And now I can see it
,You're the one that I needed
,
,You're the one that I needed
,You're the one that I needed
,
,I'd never thought I be
,Floating on the ceiling
,Losing all control
,And I think I need you too
,There's nothing left to lose
,Nothing left to lose
,'Cause now I know there's no one like you
,
,And now I can see it

,When it went down
,It was so hard to breathe
,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine~~~
,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine ~~~

,Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
,I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
,In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
,I'd act like I didn't see her
,We'd pay at the same pumps
,Flip through the same stations

,I guess that's just how it goes
,When you break up in a small town
,I see our friends and they put on a show
,Like they don't want me to know
,So they give me the go-around
,But there's only so many streets, so many lights
,I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
,I should've known all along

,For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
,But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
,I see 'em everywhere together
,And it's hitting a little too close to home
,She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
,She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
,She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
,In someone else's arms right down the road
,And I never thought that...

,And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
,And I wanna jump out
,I wanna fight
,I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't

,7년을 만났죠 아무도 우리가
,이렇게 쉽게 이별할 줄은 몰랐죠
,그래도 우리는 헤어져 버렸죠 긴 시간 쌓아왔던 기억을 남긴 채
,우린 어쩜 너무 어린 나이에 서로를 만나 기댔는지 몰라
,변해가는 우리 모습들을 감당하기 어려웠는지도
,이별하면 아프다고 하던데 그런 것도 느낄 수가 없었죠
,그저 그냥 그런가 봐 하며 담담했는데
,울었죠 우우우 시간이 가면서 내게 준
,아쉬움에 그리움에 내 뜻과는 다른 나의 맘을 보면서
,처음엔 친구로 다음에는 연인 사이로
,헤어지면 가까스로 친구 사이라는 그 말 정말 맞는데
,그 후로 3년을 보내는 동안에도
,가끔씩 서로에게 연락을 했었죠
,
,다른 한 사람을 만나 또 다시 사랑하게 되었으면서도
,난 슬플 때면 항상 전활 걸어 소리 없이 눈물만 흘리고
,너도 좋은 사람 만나야 된다 마음에도 없는 말을 하면서
,아직 나를 좋아하나 괜히 돌려 말했죠
,알아요 우우우 서로 가장 순수했었던
,그 때 그런 사랑 다시 할 수 없다는 걸 추억으로 남을 뿐
,가끔씩 차가운 그 앨 느낄 때도 있어요
,하지만 이제는 아무 것도 요구할 수 없다는 걸 잘 알죠
,나 이제 결혼해 그 애의 말 듣고
,한참을 아무 말도 할 수가 없었죠
,그리곤 울었죠 그 애 마지막 말
,사랑해 듣고 싶던 그 한마디 때문에

,Leave me bare and so exposed.
,And as I sort through all this mess,
,That’s always jumbled in my head.

,A wayward son, a wayward man.
,And I’ll find,
,That my heart is a traitor,
,Inside,
,Can you come and vindicate it?
,I wanna, wanna love you,
,But I don’t understand
,Why my heart is a traitor.
,I love what I can’t stand.

,I wanna be free of this.
,Can you break me free of this?
,As I wait for the sunrise,
,I see a new and shining sky.
,And a night that’s gone away,
,I see so clearly my mistakes.
,And as you reach deep in me,
,Show me what I wouldn't see.
,And I am humbled by your touch,
,How could I ever be enough?
,When I’ll find,
,That my heart is a traitor,

,About the God who conquers all,
,Who Helps me stand when I can’t crawl.
,And when I’m down on my face,
,Because I've chosen my own way.
,And even though I've done him wrong,
,He is there with open arms.
,When I’ll find,

,I’ve been hearing symphonies
,Before all I heard was silence
,A rhapsody for you and me
,And every melody is timeless
,Life was stringing me along
,Then you came and you cut me loose
,Was solo singing on my own
,Now I can’t find the key without you
,
,And now your song is on repeat
,And I’m dancin' on, to your heartbeat
,And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
,So if you want the truth
,
,I just wanna be part of your symphony
,Will you hold me tight and not let go?
,Symphony
,Like a love song on the radio
,
,I’m sorry if it’s all too much
,Every day you’re here, I’m healing
,And I was runnin' outta luck

,You say that I'm too complicated
,Hung up and mis-educated
,Well I say 9 to 5 is overrated
,And we all fall down
,I can't sleep 'cause my mind keeps racing
,My chest hurts 'cause my heart keeps breaking (not really)
,I'm so numb and I can't stop shaking
,And we all fall down
,Frustration, desperation
,You say I need some kind of medication

,And they can't make me a believer
,I know I'm an under-achiever

,Verse1
,现在是凌晨三点脑海清空了你的记忆
,不知道你是否躺在他的床边叙说不能说的秘密
,那些谎言编织的画面在我脑海里加载的刚刚好
,就像对我说再见的那天陷阱我掉进的刚刚巧
,已经记不清我怎么喝到了断片
,心里仿佛划过了一道闪电
,他们总说感情需要锻炼
,事情总是有正也有反面
,所以我无止境的说服自己想要主动放下一切
,而你却用你的方式以为可以毁灭我的世界
,bitch.只是我不懂为什么我开过的玩笑再也不玩笑
,给你所有关心变成多余换来在电话里的吼叫
,我不懂怎么修补这份感情掌握基本的要领
,就连最后对你的道歉都被你变成玩弄的笑柄
,我不懂我该说些什么你才不会发火
,既然当初没有问题为何你一直在闪躲
,就连最后你离开的理由都是我亲自为你编好的借口
,冰冷的躯壳在黑夜中伴随着回忆止不住的颤抖
,

,没有任何的原因 你爱的足够小心
,我无法捕捉你的气息 拼凑出是你杀死我的证据
,它却成为你我的秘密 在你心里最久的秘密 永远不敢提起的秘密
,就让彼此封尘在回忆里才美丽
,
,
,Verse2
,OK 过去的那些破事藏在我的心里早就已经不想提
,我为自己写好了另外一个剧情本来想让原版的变成谜
,直到黑夜将近连旁观者渐渐都把真相扎破
,我得到了痛恨交替的感觉不是单纯只有失落
,冲动再也无法得到克制 聪明的我开始变得弱智
,眼前川流不息的城市都被静止感觉像是世界末日
,到了现在说句实话真的为我之前的行为感到抱歉
,对你现在只有感谢而不是再去疯狂的抱怨
,感谢当初幸亏是你提前开了口
,从开始就觉得 我烂还能在一起生活了这么久?
,真的超级感谢你让我身边的那些假的找到借口顺便站了个队
,反正留在我的身边迟早也是有一天全部都被老子全部干废
,所以我不想说他们的思想天生就太low
,你给我制造的负面消息我当然会照单全收
,关于你的故事别人问起的时候我依然还是无法开口
,在最后我只想说我用这首还你之前欠的那首

,你快樂嗎 我常常這樣問自己
,當看過那么多的背信棄義 是否還該相信
,每個人都帶著那張不同的面具
,相聚在一起 卻不曾真正交心
,你看見了嗎 那片烏云正在降落
,是誰說過 雨過天晴會有彩虹的
,但那片絢爛的顏色曾幾時見過
,我追逐的夢 已在過程中遺落
,當逝去的已經來不及回想
,失去的青春也再不是舊日的摸樣
,人心的冷漠 人性的蹉跎
,今日復明日 如今得過且過
,我們還在奔波 為了所謂的生活
,當一切變了色 被現實擊落
,這滑稽的世界 掙扎會否更快樂
,還是魚死網破 或者妥協墮落
,我想去探險 我想去挑戰 我唔想使用錢都可以生存
,一年又一年 一直不變 一直不眠都系為左點樣生存
,已經見慣 已經不再起眼 現在珍惜噶唯有只有時間
,手上的疤痕 面上的就紋 表上的時間已經無得再間
,睇到太多噶事覺得心酸 聽到太多噶聲音开始覺得煩厭
,乘著風浪 不怕風險 不斷往前 抹走漆黑的一面
,煩惱同壓抑都放在歌詞當中 將自己噶身體同思想都盡情放松
,盡量珍惜身邊噶每一分 每一秒 我噶生存在世上并非渺少
,当开心 被定义为快乐
,很多人忘记了怎么去选择
,活着为了什么
,我只想望着蓝天围着海边骑着我的单车
,这样很好 就算睡不着觉
,花朵一样会对着太阳微笑
,我不知道未来会有多匆忙
,但至少还能见到明天的光
,时间匆匆掠过 我们忘记了快乐
,因为心中的欲望实在太多
,黑和白 相交成灰色
,就像乌云 只是暂时的
,不要理会别人给你强加的色彩
,只要你的心中还有爱
,这个世界并不算坏
,所以我们还是保持好心态
,夜深了 这城市又降温了
,走在街上影子在后面跟着
,分不清那些笑脸哪个是真的
,快乐不快乐里面差异有几分呢
,身边的女生开始不再讨论星座
,柴米油盐酱醋 她们每天都要经过
,也曾迷茫 也曾经有过困惑
,可是时间的脚步却从来没有停过
,年纪越来越大 烦恼越来越多
,心里很多的话 却不知道该怎么说
,曾经大把时间你都在挥霍
,现在努力工作 你说是为了生活
,欲望膨胀 该如何战胜心魔
,需要的太少可是想要的太多
,拜托 诱惑我该怎么摆脱
,拜托 让我唱完这首再说
,那时我第一次知道那座山 我喜忧参半
,她一直住在这座山 通过我攀谈
,她眼里面的这座山 的另一端
,是一艘靠在海岸边的船 能杨起帆
,于是我背叛了叮嘱 选择去投靠了自由
,冬极寒祼献于星露 功利心在山脚滞留
,回头看模糊的闪烁霓虹 的眼泪中
,一定是如释重负的轻松 只揣着梦
,还有爱 the time 我只想fight for life
,when i try 感叹 她总no lie day night
,她总能拉着我见识到山间的身边的新鲜的当天的事
,就像是帮助我拔掉了胆怯的卑鄙的深扎在心间的刺
,从没人这样对我 让我第一次能抚触到梦想的规格
,我曾经觉得除了上帝没人会爱我
,只确信love never forever
,但现在我走 ...... 坚定的笃定的向着那山顶在走
,不后退不后悔眼神中含泪在走
,跟着你走
,醒着便努力 累了便睡去
,把坦然当骨气 在一夜梦里
,梦到我终于能和你齐头并进
,靠那么近再也不是追随你脚步
,惊醒 周围都下起了雾 却没了你的踪影
,云倒泻溅起的瀑 喧闹黑肆意的幕
,say嘿呦 只听到了我的回声
,哎呦 ..
,你在哪 别再惩罚 我会报答 但是风刮太大不回答
,飞沙 你快说话 为什么她 帮我包扎却又撕开它
,到底 她是 背叛 了山 回到了都市
,还是 正在 努力 为了 登顶其他 都忽视
,其实没所谓的 过去吧 如果觉得你说的对
,既然都相信 继续吧 至少每个夜里会
,安心的迈出一步一步 一步一步的这一路
,穿过迷雾 享受着雷霆和雨露
,对？不对 傀儡 its not my fate
,亏？不亏 只为 去追my freedom
,云拨日现极峰的晴
,我爱这一切就像爱生命
,于是我走...... 坚定的笃定的向着那山顶在走
,不后退不后悔眼神中含泪在走
,我自己走 .....走.....
,那时我第一次描述那座山 我喜忧参半
,我一直住在这座山 不需要攀谈
,我眼里面的这座山 的另一端
,是一艘靠在海岸边的船 正扬起帆

,我没有办法传递太多关心
,可你却包容我拙劣的演技
,不管我的心多想靠近
,是距离 距离感压抑
,想和你分享我钻研的课题
,路边的花开好了围绕蜻蜓
,想和你共享我身边的空气
,没有你
,因为你总是在很远的地方
,找你的时候 也会担心你太忙
,你在的话 应该能有特别的想法
,你是指引着我的 我的灯塔
,你的理由是梦想
,我的理由是你呀
,我还没来得及和你一起去看极光
,看看那里到底有多值我们欣赏
,一起看这世上最美好的风光
,好吗 好吗
,还想和你一起再去看夕阳西下
,我一定保护着你不让你着凉
,好吗 好吗
,我像是观光客
,想你变成两个
,不同的个体只要能陪着我就好了
,想你的时间有点久
,没法和你并肩走
,你身边大概也会有未来的某某
,只是你离我好像有点远
,如果真的太想你还能揉揉眼
,那你能不能脚步慢点
,我没说完的话你还想听吗
,哪怕你在 很远的地方
,我想这一切都是距离感吧
,是吧
,我也不知道什么时候开始
,我们之间的距离隔了无数英尺
,无数次我想要不那么呆滞
,却发现我弄丢了你的影子 总会错你的意思
,曾以为没了你生活就不行
,才发现原来我给自己画了好大的饼
,能去更好的地方就快些走吧
,脚步也别特地那么慢啦

,当我的小鹿不再乱撞 头颅不再乱晃
,浑浑噩噩的人们无情的像服部半藏
,当我终于迷失方向 看不到前方的光亮
,渴望寻求一刻来自内心的善良
,也许有人看到了也许有人忘
,我内心的那只小鹿再也不会乱撞
,那天她把我内心唯一的火焰直接熄灭
,然后在泼一盆冷水 说我还是不够特别
,那我只能妥协 否则就是欺骗
,我不想给所有我爱的东西加上一个期限
,我还是太过普通 在这鱼龙混杂中
,蒙上眼睛一路到底继续往前冲
,我无法通过水晶球去看到我的未来
,就想怎么努力也感觉到把握不好这现在
,人们一遍又一遍地重复着韩剧中的对白
,出门假装矜持回家之后照样失态
,这社会变得太快 人都变得太怪
,忘了怎么去保护自己忘了怎么去爱
,被伤害后的人成群结队都在发着朋友圈
,说从前的那个她和自己心照不宣
,于是他痛哭流涕 扔掉痛苦的记忆
,告诉别人自己可能会变得无可匹敌
,可冰冷的路人不乎那些无所谓的话
,换不来同情换不来希望只有背后的笑骂
,像无聊的冷笑话 没有办法吸引谁听
,勾心斗角算计对方都在比谁更精
,诈骗界的精英 喜欢看你忙里偷闲
,玩了你感情玩了你的心在玩玩你的钱
,当小鹿不再乱撞 头颅不再乱晃
,浑浑噩噩的人们无情的像服部半藏
,当我终于迷失方向 看不到前方的光亮
,渴望寻求一刻来自内心的善良
,当小鹿不再乱撞 思想不再游荡
,大圣归来的时候耳机里听着我的说唱
,当我终于迷失方向 看不到前方的光亮
,渴望寻求一刻来自内心的善良
,都说本是同根生 相煎何太急
,都在不断的解着他们送我复杂的谜题
,他们控制你的思想还有你爱的一切
,数不清的关系背后都是说你坏话的唾液
,他身边的人这么多年还在一直换
,我的脾气没改一直暴躁就像核电站
,所以这段时间我的情绪一点就着
,那些不该来的被我击退落荒而逃
,当牛郎和织女相聚登上了完美的鹊桥
,当宋江惋惜为他献出生命的浪里白条
,懊悔与失落在每个孤独的夜晚交错
,回头看看还有多少未完成的承诺
,当小鹿不再乱撞 头颅不再乱晃
,浑浑噩噩的人们无情的像服部半藏
,当我终于迷失方向 看不到前方的光亮
,渴望寻求一刻来自内心的善良
,当小鹿不再乱撞 思想不再游荡
,大圣归来的时候耳机里听着我的说唱
,当我终于迷失方向 看不到前方的光亮
,渴望寻求一刻来自内心的善良

,但却习惯了偷偷描述你的背影
,没有你在的高中生活显得有点乏味
,我不像你学校的帅哥那么出类拔萃
,对你好才是重点 才是重点
,为了你我可以认真努力忘掉疲累
,有你的陪伴真的格外轻松
,陪我在夜晚一起欣赏星空
,你说你鬼灵精怪会让我发蒙
,若你是琴棋书画我样样精通
,甜蜜的话我对你说了好多
,我承认这样真的显得太啰嗦
,不懂什么浪漫但爱的太多
,听着 现在我想这么对你说
,hook

,爱能不能够 永远单纯没有悲哀
,我想带你骑单车 我想和你看棒球

,想你的好心情这样保持每天
,把你照片放到家里的每间
,时常看着窗外有你的北边
,备忘录里记下了你不喜欢的一切
,无聊时把你的名字又多写了一遍
,晚上睡不着觉又想你想了一夜
,想起你可爱模样我的心又中了一箭
,喜欢你惹我生气撒娇的样子
,喜欢你卖萌点头说着就是酱紫
,你总是拉着我绕遍整条巷子
,看你不怕吃胖吃的那么放肆
,我希望我们的感情可以越来越长久
,我们是情侣家人也是永远的好朋友
,我会一直守候你绝对不会让你走
,陪你到地老天荒绝对不会放你手
,一直以来我都不是特别会说话 糟糕
,我也知道我的脾气到底有多差
,可你总是包容我的一切我的点点滴滴，
,所以下面 唉唉 周杰伦的歌词唱给你

,像深海里的宝藏
,让我小心翼翼的探索
,你在想些什么
,眼睛总是不停打转呢
,我推掉所有饭局和朋友的邀请
,陪你看电视
,不想我离开晚饭
,就将就吃个烧饼
,把时间留给你花费
,但是我不会感到乏味
,把说唱当成威士忌
,慢慢的将你给麻醉
,我想要带你飞
,你是天使
,那我就做你的翅膀
,除了你别的女孩 看不见
,在这个世上
,你的过去若不想提起
,那就Let it go
,不想在触碰你的伤疤
,哪怕你是个Super girl
,我愿意为你
,只要你愿意
,就不留遗力的去付出
,只要你愿意
,就让伤害你的人滚开
,让我负起他没完成的使命
,就让我变成你Ipad
,能够随时接受你的指令
,oh爱 对明天有顾虑
,can fly沉默不是结局
,don't cry希望会治愈你
,I'm fine I'm fine
,oh爱 对明天有顾虑
,can fly沉默不是结局
,don't cry希望会治愈你
,I'm fine I'm fine
,如果我的flow和歌词
,能够唱出你的心声
,如果你会感动的话
,就陪我走完今生
,别嫌我浮夸
,虽然我们现在正是青春
,但我仍就要给你承诺
,陪你看遍所有的星空
,告诉我你爱不爱我
,你知道我想要的回答
,别逃避我 告诉我
,如果我是你想要的
,让我牵起你的手从南到北
,压力我来扛从难到美
,就把你放心交给我
,爬上我的后背
,不会让你感到疲累
,我们现在和未来
,把它变成电影里的对白
,我是王子你是公主
,有阳光也有小狗
,像本故事书把他讲给孩子听
,看夕阳和日出让我住进你的心
,不喜欢跟你吵架
,失去了总是难挽回
,但是这世界上除了你
,我到底还会管谁
,我的经历在我的脑海还在回味她
,就让我用这首歌唱出999朵玫瑰花
,oh爱 对明天有顾虑
,can fly沉默不是结局
,don't cry希望会治愈你
,I'm fine I'm fine
,oh爱 对明天有顾虑
,can fly 沉默不是结局
,don't cry 希望会治愈你

,忍让被你当成放纵的理由
,多少次把想说的话

,死皮赖脸的取悦你
,曾经如潮水般的爱
,一转眼到现在也已见底
,我的好不在仅限
,你的爱太奢侈我无福消受
,你就像本经书我始终都
,无法参透领悟
,就像雨后窗口为何起雾
,听得出你心里在抵触
,面对我的担心
,深夜的关机
,连接着我的喜怒
,夜晚下的琴声在此刻有多么应景
,风肆意的吹窗外下起了朦胧细雨
,有没有一种旋律会
,让你听到爱不释手
,如果思念是一种病
,我想那药该怎么入口
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应我你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样会让我心碎

,酷夏时去海边度假租游艇
,时常挂嘴里念的那句随你便
,不会想着试探触碰谁底线
,babe是否我真的不和你意
,你的冷漠就像核武器

,身边资源很多
,当然从也不缺少大蜜
,我始终相信爱我的
,始终会爱我
,随便你怎么去快活
,大不了最后就散伙
,曾经把你当做我的一切
,在空荡的房间里
,的我醉倒的不止一遍
,渐渐的我们缺少沟通
,找不到最初的方位
,眼睁睁看着爱被抽空
,你离别略显的干脆
,把对你的思念放在歌中
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味

, 咳...let's go
, 你应该知道 我这么帅的只会出现在动漫
, 要想明白你是不是我标准的共犯
, 我知道要走的路少不了动乱
, 但你放心 去的场景前所未有的梦幻
, 录音室是我常去的俱乐部
, 只要我拿起麦克风就从不缺热度
, 得分用假动作再配合一个后撤步
, 球鞋都救不了你 AJ还是换特步
, 二十二个年头走过不少分岔路
, 也受过不少伤 但从不用纱布
, 在人群面前说话习惯低八度
, 他们评价我只会说好JB酷
, 工作在押韵公司我得多加班
, 酒精在押韵中吃我的多巴胺
, 没学过跳舞也精通舞艺十八般
, 他们在念书我却报了吉他班
, 我走路带风可以这么形容
, 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
, 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
, 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
, 除了Hip-Hop 我还做点小生意
, 都打我主意所以职业病是打喷嚏
, 也会谈个恋爱 要玩点小甜蜜
, 因为人类的繁衍总归要延续
, 合作事宜尽量漂流瓶联系
, 除了比较难找还请你别嫌弃
, uh…还有 我不玩粉丝群
, 虽然很少回应但会看你私信
, 没太多私心 也没太多资金
, 但有可以阻止地球毁灭的自信
, 都说我命硬 这点我很庆幸
, 算命先生说我命好所以我信命
, 怎么水又满了你们又来抓泥鳅
, 请保护生态都抓走了怎么跟你chill
, 我又不是个大明星也不是个领袖
, 也常常找些朋友喝点小酒聊以后
, 我走路带风可以这么形容
, 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
, 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
, 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
, 身上刺个印 向偶像致个敬
, 怎么随意怎么来 别看作是个性
, 直到被勒令退学时才弄清我的特性
, 从出生就不会遵循某种设定
, 写的歌有没有模仿谁我真的不知道
, 所以随便去说我又不会去对你施暴
, 像个小学生聊世贸 还在关注次要
, 以极品制暴 就交给安全着陆制造

,有人问 我是不是缺钱缺粮缺**
,把女人的钱赚到 换副嘴脸和面貌
,我只是教养好 没选择愤怒乱叫
,但没有想到 原来嘻哈真他妈可以乱爆
,有人安慰我说作品好人品差没关系
,事情到底什么样根本没有人关心
,把爱惹事的凑一窝 看热闹不怕场子大
,我心里清楚所有兄弟就只差我讲个话
,ok没差 那就搞 也没什么大不了
,不堪一击的舆论当然只用一下就倒
,我理解大家那么气愤我也会换做是我
,但一件事情有两面 别胡乱下结果
,如果你恨我我理解 你就是喜欢怼
,但你未来还长别因为乱说话被打断腿
,有无数人觉得我快成功要把我拉下水
,跟你们没得比吃人都不会不擦下嘴
,uh 那我就拿音乐说话 没关系祸多大
,我没空发长论文我又不d是小说家
,在跟风的rapper都来自埃塞俄比亚
,看你迫不及待捧臭脚要让我火一下
,我不用你理解 你可以说我爱骗
,正好也没有**会跑到我面前犯贱
,别再说多比装可怜再扣截图学曹云金
,我赚了钱就先给女朋友买一个钻戒
,如果我是为了钱就不会拖她一个月
,现在你拿我搞舆论我也要跟你说感谢
,没有分辨力的网友那活该你脑子裂
,约定的日期都没到你竟然说我在诈骗
,不跟你们争论对错因为毕竟我做错了
,我知道事情多了总有天要被捅破的
,但杀不死我的人自然会让我变更强
,迷*水rapper 要小心总有天你会闯祸的

,好想你回到我身边
,可是却回不到从前
,我们的距离变的 那么远
,好想你回到我身边
,可是却回不到从前
,摔破的镜子到底 怎么圆
,一个人走在陌生却最熟悉那条街
,无助的背影渴望时间过的快一些
,回家的路上还是经过哪家便利店
,除了你不在我身边其实一切都没变
,一群人在夜店五彩灯光下狂欢
,一个人格格不入表现的很难堪
,朋友再劝 跟她再见 不要再恋
,嘴上愉快的答应可是内心却步履蹒跚
,其实我承认 根本没反悔的必要
,只是我遗憾 没划上完美的句号
,学着慢慢习惯 时间会贴出预告
,走过下一段 可能或许还会遇到
,自己都嫉妒我们 是多般配
,一直记住你走的 赤裸干脆
,拿着你的照片亲吻忘记你的心狠 眼神冰冷
,恍然大悟原来是在自我安慰
,好想你回到我身边
,可是却回不到从前
,我们的距离变的 那么远
,好想你回到我身边
,可是却回不到从前
,摔破的镜子到底 怎么圆
,如果开头就是 错的
,命中注定的 过客
,如果能拥有马良神笔改变结局的作者
,篡改故事结尾 抛下闭嘴不挽留的弱者
,放下自私互相给予不一味的等待获得
,选择机票换个城市却不知道去哪躲
,你和我的回忆放在心底套上密码锁
,时间不多清楚很快可能又要离开这
,放下仇恨的心里衷心的希望你快乐
,收到一条简讯 这一次不去无视你
,算不算新的险境 我旁边睡的不是你
,你的技巧又有几人会 诱惑我智力与纯粹
,分开后你在不同的男人怀里
,对 我也每晚和不同的女人睡
,谈到了对方时的笑容也已成泪
,还记得那个少年不务正业钻研说唱学还不上
,他只是想为你写首情歌 别来无恙

,跟你在一起的每时每刻都记录 不只是今天而已
,可我需要时你都不在 别提什么并肩看电影
,看你正忙着划清界限 我却还深陷到没有办法自理
,But i Falling in love my boy知道自己无法退步
,把你送我的礼物都当做领悟 也没有什么感触
,如果需要庆祝 那就感谢你一直无所谓的态度
,让我有的更多时间专注 发现我也是有感情的动物
,再次经过的路口 灯熄灭的时候
,熟悉的十二楼
,谁站在谁的门口 谁给谁的自由
,提出的我都接受
,说着关于未来的感受
,电影情节一样的温柔
,过去被时间偷走
,来不及保留
,读不懂你情绪的宇宙
,明知道不会有以后
,不需要那么讲究

,一封写给我十年后的信
,十年之后再回来听
,听听这时稚嫩的声音
,没有利益只有内心的和平
,也许十年之后我已经忘了HIPA
,那时候已经成为了孩子的爸
,只是为了自己的家庭做贡献
,而这青春的梦也很少梦见
,也许那时每天疲惫 寻找赚钱的机会
,不理会 那些所谓的烦恼
,只懂得埋头往前跑
,努力去对抗社会的煎熬
,那时候说唱和生活早已断了联系
,也许只有梦里才会出现曾经的旋律
,被惊醒 洗脸 让自己清醒
,脑中挥之不去的是曾经的声音
,那些年一起参加过的表演
,那些年经历的一次次考验
,站在舞台为了证明自己去表现
,都是我们为了音乐不顾一切的冒险
,一封写给我十年后的信

,没有利益只有内心的和平
,一封写给我十年后的信

,我想告诉 在十年后的我
,那时候不管高兴或难过
,都别忘了曾经写过的歌
,和那些年一起经历的挫折和快乐
,别让自己的爱好变成回忆
,卸下疲惫的外套穿上棒球衣
,尝试 延续那早已不见的辉煌
,把麦克风紧握在手里试试能否继续唱
,这是一封写给我十年后的信
,在十年之后我是否为说唱还在拼
,那青春的梦是否已经淡忘
,只能在街边看着年轻人在弹唱
,都说为了说唱把青春浪费
,现在不后悔十年后也不会
,因为我们有梦 也追过
,我自豪的说青春我也曾挥霍
,也许会坠落 悬崖 我愿
,十年后也不想跳出这 音乐的火圈
,这条不归路也许我不是第一个
,我相信十年后他们都放弃我依然在做
,即使傻 也要傻出自己的特点
,对于说唱我不愿只看 他 的侧脸
,虽然玩到现在所谓的名气还是没有得到
,自己喜欢就好不求说唱给我回报

,我喜欢你这四个字 谁也没有先说
,慢慢的厌倦平淡等待这种感觉无奈

,啤酒不用杯 我们直接对着瓶儿吹
,聊着过去的事儿时不时的弹着烟灰
,经历了太多事情 我们成熟了不少
,不得不承认的是我们也在慢慢变老
,这几年她的变化很大 我还在玩着hipa
,干了一大口说出憋在心里的话
,谁也没有想过还会有缘再见面
,我的泪水堆积眼眶视线看不见
,她的感情方面不太圆满透着伤感
,我也只能坐着听着没有资格管
,或许是我对她的了解还是不够

,你是否觉得自己每天过得都很疲惫
,是否忘记你的梦想觉得都已没了机会
,就像被乌云遮住双眼前方一片漆黑
,你爱过的姑娘也没有在你的身旁这依偎
,你会低迷你会觉得全世界在跟你作对
,美好的人生里面你却找不到属于你的座位
,你已经不再是那一个想要追梦的孩子
,递出的履历表上干净得像一张白纸
,我开始玩说唱的时候面对过家人的反对
,也质疑过自己 在穷酸的时候留下了眼泪
,也因为追梦 被身旁的朋友无情讽刺
,这么大的人怎么到了现在还不懂事
,我相信追梦的人不会那么轻易被打倒
,前方的障碍只是一片草坪上的杂草
,我们就像一个园丁 为梦想做着修剪
,哪怕我会失败 哪怕我今天会特别丢脸
,我是一个普通人 有着不普通的梦
,我需要更努力地工作 别怕生活中的痛
,别人的不理解 只会成为自己的动力
,人生几十年 何不为了梦想去冲击
,You walk in line.
,Sometimes you almost lost your mind
,Do you keep your faith, my friend
,There's a chance to fight.
,可能很多人会觉得说唱很吵
,我觉得很好 因为任何人只要坚持就能搞
,很多人的眼里对于说唱歌手都有很多误会
,但你不知道我们曾经为了一个比赛存了很久路费
,那时候真的简单 享受着追梦的快乐
,到很远的地方就为了拿那么几分钟麦克
,然后我失败下台转身回家
,任何的比赛结果也不敢告诉我爸妈
,那时候只有一台录音机也没有电脑
,也不敢奢求说唱会让自己的生活变好
,我只是单纯地玩 单纯地做 单纯地说
,单纯地用这饶舌写下自己的生活
,慢慢的爱上了说唱 把麦克风拿在手上
,成为了自己弟弟妹妹心目中的偶像
,关于自己的态度不用太多话说
,即使失败我也会继续 谁叫我是他们大哥
,你是否觉得自己每天过得都很疲惫
,是否忘记你的梦想 觉得前程都已没了机会
,You walk in line,
,Sometimes you almost lost your mind.
,Do you keep your faith, my friend
,There's a chance to fight.

,我没有切过香港铜锣湾
,也没有拿过刀切把别个来砍
,因为我根本就没的楞个大的胆子
,我唯一有的就是搭飞白胆识
,从重庆到深圳就是为了搞直播
,每天忙碌的奔波一整几个小时多
,其实真的有勒时候儿觉得身体都要倒塌
,我真的想回老家看一哈老爸老妈
,可是没得办法 我还是回不去
,不管你朗个整朗个做事情就是不让你如意
,不得不服气 因为我签了卖身契
,说实话有点后悔 现在想起来都太生气
,朗阁整嘛?脑壳很麻?未必遭不住咯想切自杀？
,这个就像是山鸡踏入黑社会身不由己无法自拔
,那就坚持下去免得搞得生活以后拖拍

,媳妇被睡了拍了三级 有人也骂他憨批
,但是又有多少人真正的对他关心
,其实他对感情和兄弟一直很专一
,电影人物塑造的很棒 有时候觉得我和他很像
,喜欢美女书读得少没什么文化生活方式很浪
,都是坚持着自己的选择对此太热衷
,只是不一样的是他拿刀我拿麦克风！
,他用刀砍出了自己的天地成为了乱世巨星
,而我用麦克风站在舞台上像个战士去拼
,就算是输了倒了不会因此而一蹶不振
,毕竟生活和做人总会有些顺和不顺
,很多人不理解不明白为何我如此固执己见
,就是爱做自己不愿意活在他人故事里面
,一个代表中国地图一个古惑仔之间有很多区别
,但不管怎么去区分记住都得叫声鸡爷
,你知不知道我老大是谁？
,不知道啊
,是红兴山鸡啊
,你看我老大来了

,一封写给我十年后的信
,十年之后再回来听
,听听这时稚嫩的声音
,没有利益只有内心的和平
,也许十年之后我已经忘了HIPA
,那时候已经成为了孩子的爸
,只是为了自己的家庭做贡献
,而这青春的梦也很少梦见
,也许那时每天疲惫 寻找赚钱的机会
,不理会 那些所谓的烦恼
,只懂得埋头往前跑
,努力去对抗社会的煎熬
,那时候说唱和生活早已断了联系
,也许只有梦里才会出现曾经的旋律
,被惊醒 洗脸 让自己清醒
,脑中挥之不去的是曾经的声音
,那些年一起参加过的表演
,那些年经历的一次次考验
,站在舞台为了证明自己去表现
,都是我们为了音乐不顾一切的冒险
,一封写给我十年后的信
,十年之后再回来听
,听听这时稚嫩的 声音
,没有利益只有内心的和平
,一封写给我十年后的信
,十年之后再回来听
,听听这时稚嫩的 声音
,没有利益只有内心的和平
,我想告诉 在十年后的我
,那时候不管高兴或难过
,都别忘了曾经写过的歌
,和那些年一起经历的挫折和快乐
,别让自己的爱好变成回忆
,卸下疲惫的外套穿上棒球衣
,尝试 延续那早已不见的辉煌
,把麦克风紧握在手里试试能否继续唱
,这是一封写给我十年后的信
,在十年之后我是否为说唱还在拼
,那青春的梦是否已经淡忘
,只能在街边看着年轻人在弹唱
,都说为了说唱把青春浪费
,现在不后悔十年后也不会
,因为我们有梦 也追过
,我自豪的说青春我也曾挥霍
,也许会坠落 悬崖 我愿
,十年后也不想跳出这 音乐的火圈
,这条不归路也许我不是第一个
,我相信十年后他们都放弃我依然在做
,即使傻 也要傻出自己的特点
,对于说唱我不愿只看 他 的侧脸
,虽然玩到现在所谓的名气还是没有得到
,自己喜欢就好不求说唱给我回报
,这是一封写给十年后的信···

,板鞋穿上 他瞎逛 在大街小巷
,伴随着早上的日出内心变得好烫
,尽管算半个公众人物可他还是老样子
,在广场这老地址
,与homie约滑一波
,看他外转下两坎跳到空中用手拽板
,没站稳
,板飞出之后眼神叫homie快闪
,结果意料之中 他 被摔个四脚朝天
,笑声围绕在旁边
,自己也露出笑脸
,继续滑 踩一个尖翻 滑在homie先端
,偶然甩出一个小乱 街道被叫声掀翻
,把勇气鼓起像挣脱手指的气球浮起
,越高越易炸 为了自由足矣

,他求输 玩弄这几头猪
,无趣到把他愁哭
,当然这些画面都是来自他的幻想
,尽管他很菜 热爱使他保持站在战场
,不求赞赏 奋力的突破
,输过没哭过
,在球场摩擦头顶烈日汗水冲走了虚弱
,与伙伴配合把一切烦恼释放
,就算碰巧进球都笑得像个智障
,球不停在胯下运
,观察对手的眼睛像是放大镜
,尽管到了禁区常被火锅给喂饱
,不会选择狼狈 躲着或退倒

,让行人都成他们的舞蹈员
,是因为 他们的嘴巴长了眼睛
,被看到的一切都从嘴里吐露
,只有快乐充满内心接着更换舞步
,该赚的绝不放过也不受金钱管束
,宛如翻书般传递到他阐述
,他人无法管住自己的期待向内心缓入
,然后Dj drop the beat

,我的朋友
,我不想看见有一天你背叛我
,因为利益 因为自私
,因为这个时代本来就很冷漠
,所以你理所应当的
,消失在我的生活
,就这么他妈走了
,你不用跟我解释
,我比你更了解我们全都很软弱
,还没有人逼我们自己都交枪了
,但我更不想看见
,有一天我先把你们给忘掉
,跟过去说滚蛋
,我问你怎么样你才能快乐
,你指着电视里的那个成功的肚子
,笑脸
,你欢呼的告诉我
,那就是你的明天
,还有更多的孩子羡慕你追随你
,比你更加变本加厉的
,变成你要变成的你
,终于被超过
,变老然后超脱后悔
,曾经有种声音记得对你说过
,想再一次的听到
,只有一个办法
,闭上你的眼睛
,Close ur eyes close ur eyes you can see me
,Close ur eyes you can see me
,闭上你的眼睛
,让我发现你靠近
,你穿过你释放你
,现在你是自由的
,没有人能控制你
,你什么都不知道
,也什么都不需要
,当所有的一切
,在这一瞬间消失
,这不是一场梦
,是你短暂的一生
,黑色的白色的彩色
,的灰色的天空笼罩着紫禁城
,别说你看不见
,我们还在这儿站着
,黑暗中的光是我心中的火焰
,不停的烧
,直到你心无杂念
,让理解和宽容
,从新回到这个世界
,现在擦了你的眼泪
,回到梦中
,沉睡中发生的
,让我看不清这颜色
,这色既是空
,我无法再去形容
,所以闭上你的眼睛仔细听
,给看不见这世界的人一点魔力
,会为了游戏都不肯回去
,在这个世界里
,撞来撞去还不想放弃
,这出戏 都装着不在意
,欲望的光占多大的亮
,让我的影子
,把他挡上直到你投降
,要是没有一道光
,能让你不慌
,请你拽住脏的衣裳
,互相当个陪葬
,色彩与黑暗的差距
,又何必为了得到美丽而死去
,幸好可以回忆
,拉住我的手臂
,我可以在你黑色背景
,的梦里带你回去
,希望的乞讨
,痛苦的尖叫
,战争的号角
,一直在围绕
,闭上你的眼睛接着学会有礼貌
,想找到我们就需要拼命奔跑
,Close ur eyes
,Close ur eyes you can see me close ur eyes

,欲望在黑暗中食宿
,置一切于不顾
,灵魂深度
,中毒 嫉妒执迷不悟
,想要陈述正在忍受的痛楚
,解脱我们挣扎可也无路
,当你闭上你的双眼
,才能感受到
,内心真正的无助
,想要逃离挣脱这束缚
,充满灵魂却落入地狱深处
,在炼狱炼火中有声有时混入
,黑色白色这世间并无对错
,生活每天教会你新的一课
,现实本就残酷
,却放出诱人的烟雾
,有谁心中有数
,看出它真面目
,那是一道光急转我的心脏
,左手是迷茫
,右手是握不住的希望
,闭上眼睛把这一切都遗忘
,顺着光的指引去往该去的地方
,Close ur eyes close ur eyes you can see me

,Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
,Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it
,Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..
,I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
,of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
,the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
,And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
,And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
,And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
,all this tension dispensin' these sentences
,Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
,and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
,but at least have the decency in you
,to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
,in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
,to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
,I don't know you and no,
,I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
,I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
,I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
,if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
,No patience is in me and if you offend me
,I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air
,I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
,Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
,I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
,I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
,I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
,And I am, whatever you say I am
,If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
,In the paper, the news everyday I am
,Radio won't even play my jam
,Cause I am, whatever you say I am
,If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
,In the paper, the news everyday I am
,I don't know it's just the way I am
,If your havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
,I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
,I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
,Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
,Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
,I'm from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
,If you grew up with O's and you zap the toes
,You'd celebrate the minute you was havin doe
,I'm like fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
,If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
,Got beef with radio if i don't play they show
,They don't play my hits well i don't give a shit
,SO Rap mags try and use my black ass So advertisers can give'em more cash for ads...fuckers rap
,I don't know what you take me as or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
,I'm from rags to ritches we ain't dumb we got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
,Hit me!
,but still im havin memories
,Of high speeds when the cops crash
,As I laugh
,Pushin' the gas when ma Glocks blast
,We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
,In the dark where we survived through the bad parts
,Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
,No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
,Envious Bitches they still continue to pursue me
,A couple o' movies now the whole world's tryin' to screw me
,Even the cops try to sue me
,So what can I do but stay true
,Sippin' 22s of brew
,And now the media's tryin' to test me
,Got the press asking questions trying to stress me
,Misery is all I see that's my mind state
,My history with the police is check the crime rate
,My main man had two strikes slipped
,Got arrested and flipped
,He screamed thug Life and emptied a clip

,But now I, bang bang,
,now I shoot you down
,I didn't break down even though the words were spoken
,I didn't break down even though you left me broken

,He'd call me when he's leaving
,Off I went to get him something
,Ain't I just too sweet
,So I cruised downtown to Armani

,And realized that my jimmy Choos were killing me

,You should’ve seen his place and he cried more than me at every chick flick that we saw
,(say) la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
,Fast forward to next Friday
,It's not like I've been crying
,Deep down I think I must have knew it all along
,Maybe it was his Cher playlist
,Or his craving to be A-list
,Or how he knew the words to every Britney song (oh baby, baby)
,Perhaps it was that poodle
,Or those cheese filled strudels
,He used to dip into his Frappuccino grand
,Well I must have just been kidding
,Myself into thinking
,I was more than him experimenting
,My boyfriend is gay
,I know it sounds cliché

,Steve walks warily down the street'
,With the brim pulled way down low
,Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet'
,Machine guns ready to go
,Are you ready' Are you ready for this
,Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,And another one gone' and another one gone
,Another one bites the dust
,Hey' I'm gonna get you too
,Another one bites the dust
,How do you think I'm going to get along'
,Without you' when you're gone
,You took me for everything that I had'
,And kicked me out on my own
,Are you happy' are you satisfied
,How long can you stand the heat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Chorus
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
,And bring him to the ground
,You can beat him
,You can cheat him
,You can treat him bad and leave him
,When he's down
,But I'm ready' yes I'm ready for you
,I'm standing on my own two feet
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,Repeating the sound of the beat
,
,I've been  staring at the edge of the water
,Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
,I wish I could be the perfect daughter
,But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
,Every turn I take, every trail I track
,Every path I make, every road leads back
,To the place I know, where I can not go, though I long to be
,See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
,And no one knows, how far it goes
,If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
,One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
,I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
,Everything is by design
,I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
,So maybe I can roll with mine
,I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
,I'll be satisfied if I play along
,But the voice inside sings a different song
,What is wrong with me?
,See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
,But no one knows, how deep it goes
,And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
,And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
,See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
,And no one knows, how far it goes
,If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
,One day I'll know, how far I'll go

,Tryna distract myself
,But then I see your face
,Oh wait, that's someone else
,Tryna play it coy
,Tryna make it disappear
,But just like the battle of Troy
,There's nothing settled here
,In my room there’s a king size space
,Bigger than it used to be
,If you want you can rent that place
,Call me an amenity
,Even if it’s in my dreams
,Oooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind

,I see how your attention builds
,It’s like looking in a mirror
,Your touch like a happy pill
,But still all we do is fear
,What could possibly happen next
,Can we focus on the love
,Paint my kiss across your chest
,Feel the art, I'll be the brush
,Ooh you’re taking all perfection out my mind

,And Superman unrolls
,A suit before he lifts
,But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
,She said, where'd you wanna go?
,How much you wanna risk?
,I'm not looking for somebody
,With some superhuman gifts
,Some superhero
,Some fairytale bliss
,Just something I can turn to
,Somebody I can miss
,I want something just like this
,I want something just like this
,Oh I want something just like this

,I got a long way to go
,And a long memory
,I been searching for an answer
,Always just out of reach
,Blood on the floor
,Sirens repeat
,I been searching for the courage
,To face my enemies
,When they turn down the lights
,I hear my battle symphony
,All the world in front of me
,If my armor breaks
,I’ll fuse it back together
,Battle symphony
,Please just don’t give up on me
,And my eyes are wide awake
,For my battle symphony
,For my battle symphony
,They say that I don’t belong
,Say that I should retreat
,That I’m marching to the rhythm
,Of a lonesome defeat
,But the sound of your voice
,Puts the pain in reverse
,No surrender, no illusions
,And for better or worse
,When they turn down the lights
,I hear my battle symphony
,All the world in front of me
,If my armor breaks
,I’ll fuse it back together
,Battle symphony
,Please just don’t give up on me
,And my eyes are wide awake
,If I fall, get knocked down
,Pick myself up off the ground
,If I fall, get knocked down
,Pick myself up off the ground
,When they turn down the lights
,I hear my battle symphony
,All the world in front of me
,If my armor breaks
,I’ll fuse it back together
,Battle symphony
,Please just don’t give up on me
,And my eyes are wide awake
,For my battle symphony
,For my battle symphony

,The animals inside came out to play
,When face to face with all our fears
,Learned our lessons through the tears
,Make memories we knew would never fade
,One day my father he told me
,Son, don't let this slip away
,He took me in his arms,
,I heard him say
,When you'll get older
,Your wild life would live for younger days
,Think of me as forever your faith

,one day you'll leave this world behind
,So live a life you will remember

,These are the night that never die

,When thunder clouds start pouring down
,Light a fire they can't put out
,Carve your name into those shinning stars

,Don't forsake this life of yours
,I'll guide you home no matter where you are

,Talking like a headstrong mamma
,Got a picture in your wallet
,Making me a habit, wearing your vintage t-shirt
,Tied ribbons on your top pad
,Telling me I'm all that, just like the girls from your hometown
,Sweet blooded and up-stranded, see if I can stand it, shrinking in the shallow water
,Magnetic everything about you

,Hypnotic taking over me
,White threads on my laces
,Stuck on the hinges, swinging the door to the back yard
,Cut splinters, walk a tightrope
,Spun like a bandage touch on the outer surface
,Bright eyes of the solstice wherever your mind is headed for a freight train city
,Locked up till you're moon lit
,Brushing my hair back, feeling your lips on my cold neck

,Hello darkness my old friend
,love come to talk with you again
,Because a vision softly creeping
,left its seeds while I was sleeping
,And the vision
,that was planted in my brain
,Still remains
,within the sound of silence
,In restless dreams I walked alone
,narrow streets of cobblestone
,Neath the halo of a street lamp
,I turned my collar to the cold and damp
,When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
,That split the night and touched the sound of silence
,And in the naked light I saw
,ten thousand people maybe more
,People talking without speaking
,people hearing without listening
,People writing songs
,that voices never share
,No one dare disturb the sound of silence
,Fools said I you do not know silence like a cancer grows
,Hear my words that I might teach you
,take my arms that I might reach you
,But my words like silence raindrops fell
,And echoed in the wells of silence
,And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made
,And the sign flashed out its warning
,in the words that it was forming
,And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
,And tenement halls
,and whispered in the sounds of silence

,Well I wonder could it be
,When I was dreaming about you baby
,You were dreaming of me
,Call me crazy
,Call me blind
,To still be suffering is stupid after
,all of this time
,Did I lose my love to someone better
,And does she love you like I do
,I do, you know I really really do
,Well hey
,So much I need to say
,Been lonely since the day
,The day you went away
,So sad but true
,For me there's only you
,Been crying since the day
,The day you went away
,I remember date and time
,September twenty second
,Sunday twenty five after nine
,In the doorway with your case
,No longer shouting at each other
,There were tears on our faces
,And we were letting go of something special
,Something we'll never have again
,I know, I guess I really really know
,Well hey
,So much I need to say
,Been lonely since the day
,The day you went away
,So sad but true
,For me there's only you
,Been crying since the day

,For me there's only you
,Been crying since the day
,The day you went away
,Why do we never know
,what we've got till it's gone
,How could I carry on
,The day you went away
,Cause I've been missing you so much
,I have to say
,Been crying since the day
,The day you went away
,The day you went away

,
,The club isn't the best place to find a lover
,So the bar is where I go
,Me and my friends at the table doing shots
,Drinking fast, and then we talk slow
,And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
,And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
,Take my hand, stop
,Put "Van the Man" on the jukebox
,And then we start to dance
,And now I'm singing like
,Do you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,I may be crazy, don't mind me
,Say: "Boy, let's not talk too much
,Grab on my waist and put that body on me"
,Come on now, follow my lead
,Come, come on now, follow my lead
,I'm in love with the shape of you
,We push and pull like a magnet do
,Although my heart is falling too
,I'm in love with your body
,Last night you were in my room
,And now my bed sheets smell like you
,Every day discovering something brand new
,Oh, I'm in love with your body
,Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
,Oh, I'm in love with your body
,Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i

,Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
,Oh, I'm in love with your body
,Every day discovering something brand new
,I'm in love with the shape of you
,One week in we let the story begin
,We're going out on our first date
,But you and me are thrifty
,So go all-you-can-eat
,Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate
,We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
,And how your family is doing okay
,And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
,Tell the driver make the radio play
,And now I'm singing like
,Do you know I want your love
,Your love was handmade for somebody like me
,Come on now, follow my lead
,I may be crazy, don't mind me
,Say: "Boy, let's not talk too much

,也柔软在心底 也淡的很透明
,不用像那星火之夜的传奇
,每个瞬间都要篆写成诗句
,我能给予的爱意 已经很清晰
,Please stop look up at the starry sky
,Look at me and don't move your eyes
,I will stay with you everytime
,Please stop look up at the starry sky
,Look at me and don't move your eyes
,I will stay with you forever if you like
,Please stop look up at the starry sky
,Look at me and don't move your eyes

,I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
,22 years ago to keep it on track
,The birth of a child on the 8th of October
,A toast but my granddaddy came sober
,Countin all the fingers and the toes
,Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
,18 years younger than my mama
,But I rarely got beatings cause the girl loved drama
,In single parenthood there I stood
,By the time she was 21, had another one
,This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
,Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
,Irresponsible, plain not thinking
,Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
,Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
,On your side while the baby maker slide
,But mama got wise to the game
,The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
,After 10 years without no spouse
,Momma's gettin married in the house
,Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
,Mother Queen's risin a chapter
,Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
,When they reminisce over you, my God
,My God
,It's so
,Yeah, so lovely
,That's how we like to do it in the 90's
,Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha
,When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
,My right hand Poppa Doc I see
,Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
,When my biological didn't bother
,Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
,Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
,But you can never say that his life is through
,5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
,Here we go while I check the scene
,With the Portugese Lover at the age of 14
,The same age, front page, no fuss
,But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
,Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
,But give the man a taste and he's gone
,Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
,I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
,I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
,For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
,Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
,I said pop maybe when you're older
,We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
,My old man standing yelling good God, almighty
,Use your condom, take sips of the brew
,When they reminisce over you, for real
,For real, baby
,Like that
,We for real
,Comin' atcha
,In '92
,Pete Rock & CL Smooth
,Yeah, c'mon, hit me!
,I reminisce so you never forget this
,The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
,Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
,Listen close as I prove my point
,T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
,In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
,But only you saw what took many time to see
,I dedicate this to you for believing in me
,Rain or shine, yes in any weather
,My grandmom Pam holds the family together
,My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest
,If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
,I strive to be live cause I got no choice
,And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
,So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due
,When they reminisce over you, listen
,Listen, just listen
,To the funky song as I rock on
,And that's word is bond
,I'm not playin
,Everybody, just coolin
,This song we dedicate
,To the one and only
,Never be another

,One night to be confused
,One night to speed up truth
,We had a promise made
,Four hands and then away
,Both under influence
,We had divine sense
,To know what to say
,Mind is a razor blade
,To call for hands of above, to lean on
,Wouldn’t be good enough for me, no
,One night of magic rush
,The start: a simple touch
,One night to push and scream
,And then relief Ten days of perfect tunes
,The colors red and blue
,We had a promise made
,We were in love
,We were in love
,To call for hands of above, to lean on
,Wouldn’t be good enough for me, oh
,To call for hands of above, to lean on
,Wouldn’t be good enough
,And you You knew the hand of the devil
,And you Kept us awake with wolves’ teeth
,Sharing different heartbeats in one night
,To call for hands of above, to lean on
,Wouldn’t be good enough for me, oh
,To call for hands of above, to lean on
,Wouldn’t be good enough for me, oh
,
,The morning leads me over to my window.
,The air feels sharp against my skin.
,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in
,I wonder as I listen to the wind blow.
,People walk past in the streets.
,A city that I will never meet.
,People in their cars and their cars in the streets,
,the streets in the city where I sleep.
,Walk down to the supermarket.
,Milk and bread in my basket.
,Chocolate on the shelf and my mind on the docket,
,I'm a slave to the change that's in my pocket.
,Planes draw lines in the skies.
,Beautiful people fill my eyes.
,Drawing lines now to my own conclusions,
,beauty is desire in disguise.
,The morning leads me over to my window.
,The air feels sharp against my skin.
,Am I leaning out, or the outside leaning in

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listened as the crowd would sing
,Now the old king is dead long live the king
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror, my sword and shield
,Missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,Once you'd gone there was never
,Never an honest word
,And that was when I ruled the world
,It was a wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People couldn't believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror, my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know St Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror, my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know St Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world

,People killin' People dyin'
,Children hurt and you hear them crying
,Can you practice what you preach
,Or would you turn the other cheek
,Father father father, help us
,Send some guidance from above
,Cause right now people have me questionin'
,Where is the love?
,The love

,What's wrong with the world, mama?
,People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
,I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
,Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma
,Overseas ya we tryin' to stop terrorism
,But we still got terrorists here livin'
,In the U.S.A, the big C.I.A
,The bloods and the crips, and the KKK
,But if you only got love for your own ways
,Then you only leave space to discriminate
,To discriminate only generates hate
,And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
,Madness is what you demonstrate
,And that's exactly how anger works and operates
,Man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight
,Take control of your mind and meditate
,Let your soul gravitate
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)
,to the love ya'll (to the love ya'll)

,Verse 1:
,
,这个派对办在我到的第二天
,对一切陌生所见所闻感到新鲜
,被带来一个地方室内没有禁烟
,但是冷气配灯光仿佛来到阴间
,裏面有大哥和各自的小弟
,看到桌上摆的就知道出手不小气
,然后认识主角和他的朋友
,朋友的朋友
,正谈论著名称和嫖妓(?)
,跟大家holla自我介绍"How you doin'?"
,更有几个认出我来
,"Gee, your shits flewing."
,说从纽约开到Miami到那麼远的距离
,沿路都是飞行少女陪著他们crusing
,他们说真的，每句歌词都会背
,谁家离得很近所以每次都会醉
,指著那些妹看起来好像没high起来
,又把眼盖起来
,其实都在飞
,全部都在飞
,HOOK
,疯狂的派对就这样开始。
,只要做你自己跟着拍子。(他们全部都在飞)
,各司其职你负责什麼差事？
,如果没有那跳舞吧孩子。(他们全部都在飞)
,今天晚上把口袋花个精光。
,明天才来后悔，才来心慌。(他们全部都在飞)
,疯狂的派对就这样清光
,你所承受的旧痛和新伤。
,Verse 2:
,洗手间烟雾弥漫再度起飞
,深夜的人越来越多不小心挤推
,舞池中热舞开著大腿弯著脊椎
,用色子吹牛玩法还有栽，还有飞
,还有杯子空了就马上帮你加满
,最容易露口的浓度你可别加反
,时间超过午夜但好像还是傍晚
,要卷要抽要干嘛都行你可别发懒
,部分的我在这度过整个二十六岁
,我知道时光流逝只能往前不能后退
,试著掌控自己的节奏像控球后卫
,我也跑了好久留了汗别嫌弃臭味
,而我还是那个样
,在这疯狂的派对持续疯狂的Bounce
,突然纽约和台北变得那麼像
,在这疯狂的派对大概烧了几个ounce
,HOOK
,疯狂的派对就这样开始。
,只要做你自己跟着拍子。
,各司其职你负责什麼差事？

,疯狂的派对就这样清光
,你所承受的旧痛和新伤。
,在这疯狂的派对疯狂的过著
,在这疯狂的派对疯狂的roll著
,在这疯狂的派对疯狂的过著
,在这疯狂的派对疯狂的smoke著
,
,
,当我刚降落，分不清东南西北
,经济舱的你也知道没空间可踢腿
,手机不曾打卡在陌生的经纬
,多少人留下期待高的薪水
,浪漫的夜 婊子总幻想在路边亲嘴
,我说的是那些婊子心里总是虚伪
,每个晚上她们就像麻烦把我摧毁
,渴望跑车珠宝衣服金卡渴得像是缺水
,反应是：“ayo ayo motherfucker”
,大声地叫我剛下船的的chinky后面加个黑鬼
,消费X你妈的贵的不行
,这城市有多少乞丐在地上跪著不起
,还有多少非法移民还没有户籍
,什麼狗屁在这一点都不光怪陆离
,尝试放手那些事情 我无法顾及
,有时心有余力但是问题出在距离
,想飞的更高 看清楚全世界
,我喜欢分享和传导不像陳世念
,所以批评和赞美 我都致谢
,直到在你眼前像是风筝断了线
,点燃那paper,那味道so strong
,我看到电视上好多人精神受创
,那些生命财产被不公平地夺走
,官官相护 最扯的是政府还有总统
,发生在我的家 生气到离开椅子
,游行队伍抗争嘶吼摇著旗子
,谁敢负责不只是让民众指著鼻子
,统计数字加一 明天也许你或我的名字
,就是报纸头条 引起全民公愤
,上面贪腐也没差 社会缺乏公正
,你做什麼我也做什麼 就像是烹饪
,那是一座贪婪的小岛 被大家公认
,金钱可以处理一切 当你揭开那内幕
,连她都接受贿赂 藉口是没有退路
,而那对我还是福尔摩沙 只是一直退步
,不再健康 她生病了不知何时恢复
,那是我的最初 希望也是我的归宿
,此时此刻 多少人后悔选了那几个废物
,抱歉我无法计算 当我体会生命的价值 那无法替换
,別人的兒子死不完（台语）他们只想要净赚
,铜臭味从一早出门就开始弥漫
,等著一夕致富太多婊子选择给人干
,黑头轿车载著穿軍裝的杀人犯
,当记者推挤把脸遮住生怕给人看
,或是不在乎的样子 看你有何能耐
,从南到北横行无阻 好像没有人在
,夹在国文课本里的礼义廉耻忠孝仁爱
,都变成bullshit
,
,
,
,
,
,原因不明 冬天的地鐵突然悶熱到不行
,用毛巾擦著滿頭大汗彷彿酷刑
,下一班不知何時來目的無法步行
,背包背著
,遠遠來了一輛開著大燈看 他也飛著
,雙眼幾乎發昏 嘴裡碎碎唸著
,脖子像蘿蔔蹲
,上下符合情境 說中你的心聲
,耳機放的有夠大聲
,韻腳隨天氣加溫 笑點也加分
,那條金色項鍊 讓人印象加深
,看就知道他想當個饒舌歌手瓜分 這遊戲
,帶著洋基的帽子
,NYPD經過手上甩著哨子
,廣播通報乘客 插隊的往前一站
,那不是我的車 當我抬頭一看
,
,後來我跟剛剛提到那個同個車廂
,除了我們還有幾個太太坐在中央
,位子多到不用站著 所有乘客期盼的
,眼神堅定彷彿知道未來在哪
,現在終於看清楚了穿著喬丹八代
,拿著酒裝牛皮紙袋裡他看著窗外
,唸著那些歌詞婊子大麻還有幫派
,他看我我看他都屬於stay  real  type
,他打量我的球鞋給我一個點頭
,不知道他是讚美我還只是跟著節奏
,皇后區的慢車 地下道的黑洞
,那過程 所有內容拿來歌頌
,紐約大都會的帽子我都戴的低
,看剛上車 對面那個男的叫的雞
,那濃妝豔抹 香味刺鼻快不能呼吸
,這時我才想到要下車 差點來不急
,
,月台和車廂到處充滿低頭族
,我還人生地不熟學著記地圖
,越夜越美麗美每晚都像是星期五
,不管他人的眼光
,一個人起舞 起舞 跟著起舞

,每晚7点准时发药 他希望有疗效
,而我带着这的孩子从他的眼底下逃掉
,我们继续干 干掉那些密告犯

,手里抱着泰迪熊妈妈念着故事
,先从绿野仙踪到糖果屋烟囱
,直到梦游仙境跟踪爱丽丝和那兔子
,妈妈吻了他的脸
,她的脸美的连仙度蕊菈都嫌不美差的远
,规则简单的很的世界不像几何般
,他知道自己不会长大就像彼得潘
,当他睡醒怎么一切变得不堪
,手上的泰迪熊变成了色情书刊
,妈妈收起他的童话故事叫他多念点书
,爸爸工作繁忙忘了他的毕业演出
,年纪渐长鼻子像小木偶变长
,脸上有魔痘却没巨大藤蔓爬上天堂
,学会了心机和谎言
,然后他朝着幸福快乐美满的结局往前

,这女孩最爱她妈咪总把棉被拉起哄她入睡
,等爸爸回来送她芭比
,逢节全家旅行驾着南瓜马车爬山涉水
,碰到阿拉丁在巴格达
,妈妈常说她像白雪公主一样
,以后会遇到白马王子把白色婚纱给披上
,好多的景象好美的气象好想要永远这样
,只是敌不过时间的力量
,她懂事她爸爸升上董事妈妈开始讽刺
,他妈的开始充斥她的用词
,魔镜阿魔镜女孩已越出童话国境
,小红帽在网路上找大野狼谈情说性
,当爸爸回家没带芭比只带酒味
,当妈妈睡前之吻算一算已经久违
,她必须学会心机谎言来迁就事实
,然后从此过着幸福快乐美满的日子

,少女闭上眼网友就给他晃点
,假设自己还是公主哪怕只是个障眼法的
,故事是假的或者现实纯属虚构
,他多么希望很久很久以前变成不久以后

,我看见了 光
,Bridge:
,那就是光 那就是光
,Verse 1：
,你变的轻易被煽动
,不再写首安静的歌给你播放
,现在有舞台跟观众 和三年前的梦里多像
,那时没人给你鼓励也没人听你唱
,流出的热泪却还在心里烫
,you put it down
,但窘境还要over come
,不想妥协所以经常对外说出谎话
,不过男人的困难当然都要由自己挡下
,只有过程痛大于快乐才会一直逼你长大
,keep going趁自己还没老去之前
,在黑暗里对自己说过的肺腑之言
,下定了决心就离开了那个温暖的屋檐
,一个人在外面的城市不习惯却总是失眠
,一人忙到凌晨5点吃饭就叫餐
,一人孤军奋战享受早上的第一道光
,问你为什么这么努力你说只因路窄
,对不起到现在没什么成就但还死心不改
,Double-D:
,有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
,你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
,你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
,就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
,可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
,你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
,你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
,就像是 未来的光 来到了 在光来之
,Verse 2:
,这几年的成长路
,有时会被捆绑住
,有时为了钱放下了桀骜让自己很想吐
,是谁当初誓不放弃 坚定的寸步不让
,是谁幼稚到自不量力 的紧抓住不放
,只是想做好音乐并不喜欢跟谁比较
,因为音乐比朋友靠谱 会一直在陪你笑
,名利来的太快 而你要速度适中
,害怕深陷贪婪的沼泽开始固步自封
,人与人之间无法跨越的社会屏障
,连父母都无法理解音乐却陪你热泪盈眶
,是的没错 你疯了 对音乐一往情深
,不还手 不罢休 看着远处的一盏明灯
,当你孤独的坚韧的弥补着16岁前的空白
,他人的光鲜外形 逼着你穿金戴银
,脚踏实地的填满歌词的一字一句
,拿到你想要的自然会帮你除去疑虑
,Double-D:
,有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
,你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
,你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
,就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
,可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
,你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
,你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
,就像是 未来的光 来到了 光来之前
,Verse 3:
,越来越重 越来越痛
,越担心就越会跌进泥沼
,那清澈的溪水 眼泪汇成了
,大河弯弯的梦
,当死规则被你撞破后
,连坚持自我都算做错
,都指责你曾犯过错
,逼着你独自溃烂堕落
,for real
,没停止过的较劲
,你说你自己可以 嘴硬的要命
,就像颗固执的石头
,紧握手指头 死命的追着
,撞破了规则 一切都为了
,疲倦的极限的追寻的光来以后
,还需要在撑几个回合
,Double-D:
,有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
,你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
,你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
,就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
,可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
,你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
,你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
,就像是 未来的光 来到了 光来之前
,那就是光 穿过颤抖的肩膀
,那就是光 你可以抓着不放
,那就是光 有多少疲倦过往
,你看 你看 你看 那就是光

,竹板这么一打呀
,我说不出想说的话
,当我用一块胶布这样粘上我的嘴
,你是否还感到害怕 爸爸
,父亲 你让我害怕
,你知道我深爱着你给的家
,在我离开的时候我止不住的想它
,想回家看家的变化
,但是我的父亲 你忘了我们约定
,你忘记了你说曾经 忠言逆耳利于行
,你一心为了家境 疏远了文化感情
,我懂你父亲我也懂你对她的那份冷冰冰
,但是我嫉妒住在西边的邻居有台钢琴
,我也羡慕 东边的邻居能唱流行
,我也知道 你总想让我拉个二胡什么的
,可是爸爸 我已经长大了
,我知道我的爱我为她远渡重洋
,我却为了你的决定而暗自神伤
,我想要带她回家 可你却不愿见她
,我想要和她私奔可我怕我会想家的 我的爸爸
,你用一块胶布封住了我的嘴
,你思考的角度 总让我流泪
,我其实不是一个 叛逆的孩子
,也许你不爱我了 但是我是爱你的
,你用一块胶布封住了我的嘴
,你思考的角度 总让我流泪
,我其实不是一个 叛逆的孩子
,也许你不爱我了 但是我是爱你的
,父亲 我只是想给你最好的
,我来自丹东 你知道我经历过什么
,我想让他们知道我们不只有钱和坦克
,我们五千年的文化从来就不是缺的
,胡人的二胡我们融合了它
,来自波斯的喇叭现在叫唢呐
,来自西域的箱琴演变成琵琶
,我就不信我们的家就不能有她
,我知道有人害怕 外来的文化
,我知道有人为她吸毒 有人为她打架
,但也有人像我一样 顶着风沙说话
,我只是不想再听老外说咱家的坏话 我的爸爸
,你用一块胶布封住了我的嘴
,你思考的角度 总让我流泪
,我其实不是一个 叛逆的孩子
,也许你不爱我了 但是我是爱你的
,你用一块胶布封住了我的嘴

,两个人进 一个人出
,一个人住 两人房 一个人租
,一个人读 两个人的书
,一个人的二轮电影 一个人笑 一个人哭
,一个人出门 带两顶安全帽
,看到街上两个人 他们用一个安全套
,一个人去好乐迪 钱要算两个人
,唱两个人的故事 一个人铺陈
,在两个人的节日 一个人过节
,两个人的过节 一个人作结
,留下一张照片 两倍想当时
,原来一个人作菜 寂寞两汤匙
,那就第二件半价的酒 一个人醉
,跟大家说 一个人ok阿 两个人累
,那就一边泪水 一边干笑 他是两栖类
,偶尔探了探另一边 若有人理会
,他是二分之一
,他是二分之一 只剩下一半 留在那一段
,想着那一段 想到那 副歌唱一半
,想像跟那一个人在周休二日
,或许跟以前一样 在午夜二时
,想像跟那一个人生出他们的二世
,一想到太美 不敢想第二次
,所以又一个人看表演 在驳二
,一首动人情歌 他又想丑二
,一度两双鞋 齐步走 一二 一二
,奈何 此刻 两头烧 那时一头热
,从此在二与一打转
,一个人的话题谈两个人 请打断
,又在双人的场合变成单细胞
,那许了两个愿望最后一个难打算
,终于他从两手 露了一手
,终于他从二流 也爬到一流
,没人吸二手烟 不再是二手货
,剩下一种落寞 眼角里没躲过
,他是二分之一
,他是二分之一 只剩下一半 留在那一段
,想着那一段 想到那 副歌唱一半
,他...
,他是二分之一
,他是二分之一 只剩下一半 留在那一段
,想着那一段 想到那 副歌唱一半

,《第一话》
,有个高中生从大楼跳下伤重不治
,有个父亲看着新闻指责这个高中生的不是
,然后他对他儿子说 自杀是不孝的
,赶快去念书 还要靠你养的
,有个校长得知校内有个学生寻死
,马上联络电视台 请求不要公开学校的名字
,有个网友看到这则新闻马上po
,谴责少年逃避现实的留言马上多
,有个路人 曾看到被殴打的死者
,死者看着路人 路人只是看着死者
,有群记者 对死者的双亲穷追不舍
,问说“儿子死了 会不会觉得不舍”
,而有个官员 则是把这件事当消遣
,因为可以转移他那诽闻的焦点
,刑警在现场发现死者虐猫的照片
,上面写着“你要以死来作为道歉”
,
,(Chorus)《刑警笔记簿的一角》
,
,凶手不只一个 死者不只一个
,被害的加害者 加害的被害者
,人们何时开始如此彼此对待着
,受伤的人不只一个 伤害的人不只一个
,有些伤看不见的 人如此彼此对待着
,
,《第二话》
,
,死者生前被霸凌的新闻登上版面
,有个妈妈觉得无聊 就把报纸翻面
,她小孩吵着要走 她叫他不要插嘴
,然后牵着小孩的手在超商里插队
,有个少年看着自己的钱被用马桶冲走
,旁边的同学围着他 喊着“凶手”
,他回到家里发现脸书被人灌爆
,有个留言写着“干！你杀人犯！操”
,他爸问他为何要逼同学走上绝路
,他说他只是看不惯人欺负动物
,他爸说“算了，重点是把大学考到”
,
,那天夜里他看着手腕拿起了小刀
,有群女孩笑着讨论那割腕的少年
,有一个说死了也好 长得很讨厌
,有名刑警 听着她们对话打了冷颤
,他在想 这些人是没杀人的杀人犯
,
,(Chorus)《刑警笔记簿的一角》
,
,凶手不只一个 死者不只一个
,被害的加害者 加害的被害者
,人们何时开始如此彼此对待着

,
,《最终话》
,
,刑警前往礼堂 但步伐很勉强
,他受邀针对校园暴力作一场演讲
,身旁经过的学生 他们笑容洋溢
,他不确定 那是否只是种防御
,他想起自己的女儿 也正值这岁数
,而有些热情在这个年纪就结束
,他自认和女儿相处的很好 没太多争吵
,但也会担心对她其实所知甚少
,有个老师边抱怨学生边带着他到会客室
,他感觉到自己的耐性正在被测试
,老师模仿起侦探说：“犯人只有一个”
,刑警心想 错 犯人不只一个
,有些指纹没留下
,那致命伤没多大
,而死者不说话
,案件布幕已落下
,
,(Chorus)《刑警笔记簿的一角》
,
,凶手不只一个 死者不只一个
,被害的加害者 加害的被害者
,人们何时开始如此彼此对待着
,受伤的人不只一个 伤害的人不只一个
,有些伤看不见的 人如此彼此对待着

Who the fuck is this 亂放箭 餐桌既禮儀彷似被漠視

放肆 In my house No One fuck with me

由土下座到下座 席次都不換邊 沒收你碗同碟 你猶如碗同碟 易碎裂

Never try to get cream 除非你學會巴結先

別沒收我的碗筷 我的刺殺行動乾淨的像是不剩任何一粒白米飯

這是道私人邀約 壓迫你的思想

空間小到能被逼供出你的景仰

你得注意這桌菜的擺設還有方向 像是最後的晚餐 你該飯前先禱告

說食之無味是因為被斷絕對外界的訊號 高呼阿門 通常也沒什麼意義

手裡握的餐具都新的 你得提防這用意

不講黑夜降臨請閉上眼睛 這一套殺手遊戲

餐桌禮儀都是假的幹嘛還跟我客氣

外場的大佬都是臥底 還是義憤填膺 別讓毛孔撐得太大

顯示你的顧忌外頭有誰接應 韻腳代步變逃生的工具

連我嘴巴噴的彈子 也觸犯槍支條例

呢場盛宴揭幕 WSR 臺灣接駁 過黎坐你將被切割

咪再掙扎 we coming through 將人潮分隔

it's gettin hot 被掟落油鑊度轟炸 第一法則 先黎將佢煎皮拆骨 WHAT

要求要牛肉 你因住啃親 咁多鬥爭 牙齒印 只因啲銀紙唔夠分

fuck it 將佢中間分界 財物吞曬 係呢個弱肉強食嘅生態

心態 適者生存 一場血腥嘅競技 blood sport 令到對方再冇脈搏 再得到勝利

cause it's the cream 控制住一切世事

the war's on 再同你多講 都廢事

炮製佢用撒野兵法 將佢人間蒸發 聽晚之後佢長眠冰格

,活死人制造。
,注：本歌曲提到的所有人名都只是玩笑，并无恶意。
,你想杀了我吗？朋友
,请你给我一点威胁好吗
,你想杀了我吗？朋友
,来把我的权威撼动试试好吗？
,你想杀了我吗？朋友
,来给硬核之王一点威胁好吗？
,你想杀了我吗？朋友
,快把硬核之王权威撼动好吗？
,砍不死他不止有八条命
,不怕死是他特质
,他个子两米八打拳击比泰森
,难不成你阻止了他？跳进湖
,假死之后则是他随时
,一举刀变成杰森
,到处是找路的找处的假呼的
,暴徒吧智障和乌合之众
,就随便你们结盟
,告诉你跑路吧保住你
,仅剩的脑路吧
,世上有我这种怪物
,追杀你可别怂
,砍不死的法老
,百年保值就像玛瑙
,信念改变圈子
,快把路易十六打到
,召集我的神兵
,可把纣王关进大牢
,王侯将相宁有种乎
,加句Mother fucker
,我从底层走出至今
,从未改变初衷
,踩着平庸圈子里面
,已是百年出众
,随你说我对不上拍
,没有天赋平庸
,这些喝紫水的毫无建树
,只能当个蛀虫
,我车子不带刹车
,撞死学舌的八哥
,黑怕圈梅威瑟
,脚踩嘴炮拳打嘉禾
,贝爷dna 却常犯七宗罪
,我从不道歉谁叫
,对手都是嘎嘣脆
,惹到爷就像大妈
,掉进粪坑那种背
,惹到爷掉进大海
,也被鸟屎砸中背
,制作人从不让我买单
,还给加工费
,是个人都想
,砍死法老非洲到台北
,Pharaoh是个砍不死的bug
,而且他会继续在你身边骂着
,在你听着摇滚之前他就准备发车
,在你改听民谣之后还要继续发歌
,把这首的前奏给加到六十秒
,我不要迈克那么谁敢接过要
,我没有时间理会那些尼安德特人
,我的火箭已经升空你却只有树皮啃
,傻逼老外靠边站
,脑残迷妹靠边站
,没实力的靠边站
,因为我要砍死法老
,白脸娘炮靠边站
,胆小懦弱靠边站
,逆来顺受靠边站
,因为我要砍死法老
,带上顶极麻药
,再磨好金背大刀
,不喜欢大枪大炮我要
,往你眼睛里灌辣椒
,蓄力积攒大招
,带再上发套
,buzzy真皮发套
,凶杀现场我会
,找一个人打扫
,不过不好意思
,我跟你们不是一路
,砍死法老的只有我
,你们只能在家吸毒
,一度溢出的伤害
,让群众来不及写下遗嘱
,Fuck你的信仰
,管你穆斯林还是基督
,实力的差距正在扩大
,就像四维高于三维
,用时间发育不管你们弄
,虚作假制造犯规
,把难度调低
,以为你们就能赢过我
,顺手就暴击撕开了
,所有的隐蔽的肮脏龌龊
,Motherfucker法老一段时间不见
,你怎么又有进步
,怎么又有一堆废物
,说唱生涯被你禁锢
,我真的很想剖开进入
,你的大脑
,调包你的研究进度
,从此只有龙崎没有法老
,现在是神与神之间的战斗
,小逼都离开生物圈来不及
,时间给你颤抖
,要砍死法老先砍死我
,要砍死我先砍死rango
,可能他一根腿毛就
,足够让你烫口
,Pharaoh是个砍不死的bug
,而且他会继续在你身边骂着
,在你听着摇滚之前他就准备发车
,在你改听民谣之后还要继续发歌
,把这首前奏给加到60秒
,我不要迈克那么谁敢接过要？
,我没有时间理会那些尼安德特人
,我的火箭已经升空你却只有树皮啃
,开着无敌的挂
,Hiphop独立的爸
,炸到你妈都怕
,嘴巴武器绝杀
,即使无情的无名也对我如临大敌
,施瓦辛格的乳清写的正是我的大名
,Like bruce lee
,用着传统搏击爆揍国际巨星
,改造五十一区女粉
,都像暴走萝莉
,抬高你再多身价
,你也被我给套走money
,在高手如林的世界
,我是悟空你是库林
,接下这元气弹
,致敬给天津饭
,不过说唱圈的蛋糕
,我要准备切一半
,我不骂前辈因为
,这事前辈从不干
,新人谁敢冒犯
,那就让我言归正传
,即使隐藏不再隐藏
,也没法将我隐藏
,Young cee再强硬
,也难以将我枪毙
,堂堂的光光见我也要慌慌
,伴随铛铛在礼堂
,接过老脏的underground
,别再来吹牛你有多少斤两
,早在八年前我就
,得到你哥欣赏
,用着花呗的buzzy
,都能把你们秒
,你扎堆的发霉的
,韵脚臭过你的脚
,我用八倍的努力
,换来扒灰的武器
,你想炸毁我飞机
,可以麻烦先升级
,你的小炮小打小闹
,小看大道一群跳蚤
,还想要砍死法老
,Pharaoh是个砍不死的bug
,而且他会继续在你身边骂着
,在你听着摇滚之前他就准备发车
,在你改听民谣之后还要继续发歌
,把这首前奏给加到60秒
,我不要迈克那么谁敢接过要？
,我没有时间理会那些尼安德特人
,我的火箭已经升空你却只有树皮啃
,演出正式开始
,活死人再次回到你的身边
,打趴你身边的每个fake rapper
,我们从来不是玩虚的
,你想灭了我那得看看你的水平
,这是mcpharaoh和markie
,lil motherfuckin andy

,Verse 1:
,Cause I remember where do we used to sit
,In a government yard in 广州
,Obba, obba, observing the hypocrites
,As they would mingle with the good people we meet
,Good friends we have, oh good friends we've lost
,Along the way
,In this great future you can't forget your past
,So dry your tears, I say...
,Chorus：
,No woman no cry
,No woman no cry
,Little darling, don't shed no tears
,No woman no cry
,Verse 2：
,当我回想一路走来过程不太现实
,我当着rap star 但是还得做着兼职
,他们都劝我放弃叫我改行说我偏执
,但革命尚未成功 朋友我必须坚持
,同志们仍需努力 这不算创造奇迹
,黎明到来之前总会有暴风雨的洗礼
,如果你了解我们当年是怎么发迹
,你也会清楚我们一样会再次发力
,你一定记得我们现场引爆的巨大声浪
,有人甚至把我们的口号给纹在身上
,既然可以承受地壳撕裂的震荡
,那就足以证明我们拥有巨人的分量
,So the beat goes on the track goes on
,你知道有些声音永远有力量
,Till I die 依然向世界传递着清香
,Till I die 依然握紧那把机枪
,Bridge：
,Everything is gonna be alright * 8
,
,Chorus：
,No woman no cry
,No woman no cry
,Little darling, don't shed no tears

,The unmistakable fire
,In the burning heart
,
,In the warriors code
,There's no surrender
,Though his body says stop
,His spirit cries - never
,Deep in our soul
,A quiet ember
,Know it's you against you
,It's the paradox that drives us on
,It's a battle of wills
,In the heat of attack
,It's the passion that kills
,The victory is yours alone

,When the sky was gold
,And I needed no protection
,But as the wind would blow
,A thousand miles in no direction
,Man, it was a beautiful sight
,Days were soaked in sunlight
,Just so long ago
,But lately I like to imagine
,
,When I was young
,Whatever happened it would do me no wrong
,As long as I could sing my favorite song
,When I was young, oh
,And the holidays went on and on
,We were so high
,Let the freeway take us into the night
,And in the dark you sang my favorite song
,When I was young, oh
,And the holidays went on and on and on, and on, and on
,When I was young
,(Woo!)
,
,Now the sky is gray
,But honestly, it doesn't hurt me (No)
,I learned to find my way
,On the path and no returnin', oh, oh
,Everything I've left behind
,I'm reminded every time I meet your eyes
,We were so bold and brave
,Baby, can you imagine?

,
,When I was young
,We would play with fire
,When I was young
,And we would fuck the price
,When I was young
,It was do or die
,I would give my life just to feel like
,When I was young
,
,Ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh
,(Oh, do or die)
,When I was young
,Do me no wrong
,We were so high

,When I was six years old
,I broke my leg
,And I was running from my brother and his friends
,And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
,I was younger then
,Take me back to when
,I found my heart and broke it here
,Made my friends and lost them through the years
,And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
,I know I've grown
,I can't wait to go home
,I'm on my way
,Driving at 90 down those
,Country lanes
,Singing to Tiny Dancer
,And I miss the way you made me feel
,It's real, we watched the sunset
,Over the castle on the hill
,
,Fifteen years old
,And smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
,Running from the law through the backfields
,And getting drunk with my friends
,Had my first kiss on a Friday night
,I don't reckon that I did it right
,But I was younger then
,Take me back to when
,We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
,We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
,Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
,Oh, how we've grown
,I can't wait to go home
,I'm on my way
,Driving at 90 down those
,Country lanes
,Singing to Tiny Dancer
,And I miss the way you made me feel

,Over the castle on the hill
,Over the castle on the hill

,One friend left to sell clothes
,One works down by the coast
,One had two kids but lives alone
,One's brother overdosed
,One's already on his second wife
,One's just barely getting by
,But these people raised me
,And I can't wait to go home
,And I'm on my way
,I still remember these old
,Country lanes
,When we did not know the answers
,And I miss the way you made me feel
,It's real, we watched the sunset
,Over the castle on the hill

,Whether he's on salary' paid hourly
,Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
,Whichever comes first' for better or worse

,Time to put my life back together right now
,It was my decision to get clean' I did it for me
,Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
,So I could come back a brand new me' you helped see me through
,And don't even realise what you did' believe me you
,I been through the ringer' but they can do little to the middle finger
,I think I got a tear in my eye' I feel like the king of
,My world' haters can make like bees with no stingers' and drop dead
,No more beef flingers' no more drama from now on' I promise
,To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
,You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
,Cause the way I feel' I'm strong enough to go to the club
,Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
,Cause I'm raising the bar' I shoot for the moon
,But I'm too busy gazing at stars' I feel amazing and
,I'm not afraid to take a stand

,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,Wasn't ready to be a millionaire, I was ill-prepared
,I was prepared to be ill, though, the skill was there
,In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
,It was 'bout bustin' raps and standin' for somethin'
,Fuck an acronym
,Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
,With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
,It ain't over 'til I say it's over - enough when I say enough
,Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up up
,I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
,When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
,Raise your hands up like it's 12 noon
,Nah, homie, hold them bitches straight up
,Wait until you dislocate a rotator cuff
,Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
,Nah, egos, I ain't deflatin' 'em
,Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
,I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
,And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
,To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
,They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
,I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter
,I can adjust, plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
,So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
,Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
,What, like I give a fuck
,I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
,To the side of a pump
,0 to 60 hop in and gun it
,Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin' 'em up
,And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
,And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
,Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bounce
,Stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut
,While I'm whiping my butt
,Cause I just shitted on the mic and like getting cut
,I get excited at the sight of my blood, you better fight with a nut
,Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
,Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier
,Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far
,Picture me quitting, now draw a circle and put a line through it, slut
,It's survival of what?
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,So get your ideas, stack your ammo
,But don't come unless you come to battle, jump in the saddle
,This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
,Lift, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
,Refuse to quit, the fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
,If I don't do this music shit I lose my shit
,Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
,It's all I know how to do
,As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
,But my respect is overdue
,I'm showin' you the flow no one used
,I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
,So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other traits
,So you'd better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
,Cause you'll never take my pride from me
,It’ll have to be pried from me
,So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
,But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
,Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
,And if you don't like me then fuck you!
,Self esteem must be fuckin' shooting through the roof
,Cause trust me
,My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
,I can see why the fuck I disgust you!
,I must be allergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze
,I just go atchoo then achieve!
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all

,
,Here to stay
,Even when I'm gone
,When I close my eyes
,Through the passage of time
,Kings never die
,
,I can hear the drummer drumming
,And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
,But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
,And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
,Was it, too good to be true?
,Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
,Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
,Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
,Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
,Just choosing to sin
,Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
,Do whatever I gotta do just to win
,Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
,Crown around it, thorns on it
,Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
,How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
,But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
,I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
,But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
,Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
,Only time I ever been out and about
,Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
,Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
,Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
,Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
,I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
,Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
,Cause someone told me that
,(Kings never die)
,Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
,You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
,Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
,Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
,Obliterate anyone in the way
,I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
,But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
,Tell these new artists that kings never die
,Did it just say I've been upstaged?
,Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
,I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
,On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
,But as days pass in this shit
,And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
,If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
,Comeback as if I went away
,But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
,Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
,Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
,They so want a champion to fall
,It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
,So fuck what these cynics say
,(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
,And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
,With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
,On the floor stacked against the door
,Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
,Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
,And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
,If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
,And I'm not gonna be
,Here to stay
,Even when I'm gone
,When I close my eyes
,Through the passage of time
,Kings never die
,I want it, I'm comin' to get it
,So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
,Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
,And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
,Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
,Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
,And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
,Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
,Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause
,They say kings never die
,Just ask Jam Master Jay
,They just grow wings and they fly
,So, hands up, reach for the sky
,Try to hold and prolong these moments
,Cause in a blink of an eye
,They'll be over
,Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
,And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
,So before you're leavin' this Earth
,You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
,Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
,Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
,I went from powdered milk and Farina
,To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
,From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
,I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is

,Held up so high
,On such a breakable thread

,And I thought we could be
,You were everything, everything that I wanted
,We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it

,Yeah, for those of you that

,This is ten percent luck
,Twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure
,Fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
,Mike<Mike>
,He doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck em'
,He knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,It's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story
,Makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up(Let's go!)
,
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps
,Put it together himself, now the picture connects
,Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
,
,This is twenty percent skill
,Eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
,And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method,Name Of The Game
,Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
,I like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!
,
,This is ten percent luck
,Twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure
,Fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
,
,They call him Ryu, he’s sick
,And he’s spittin fire with Mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,What a fuckin’ nihilist porcupine
,He's a prick, he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,And rappers hope he get shot
,Eight years in the makin'
,Patiently waitin to blow
,Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
,
,Tak
,He's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,He often gets a comment on his name
,People keep askin him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof
,Got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent
,
,Forget Mike
,Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
,It’s like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,
,This is ten percent luck
,Twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure
,Fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

,Good goodbye

,Live from the rhythm it's
,Something wild venomous
,
,Enemies trying to read me
,You're all looking highly illiterate
,
,Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
,You won't find an equivalent
,
,I've been here killing it
,Longer than you've been alive you idiot
,
,And it makes you so mad
,Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
,
,And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
,There's more than one of you
,
,And you can't understand the fact
,That it's over and done hope you had fun
,You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
,Headed back where you're from

,Goodbye good riddance
,A period is after every sentence
,Did my time with my cellmate
,Maxed out so now we finished
,Every day was like a hail date
,Every night was like a hailstorm
,Took her back to my tinted windows
,Showin' out she in rare form
,Wings up now I'm airborne
,King Push they got a chair for him
,Make way for the new queen
,The old lineup where they cheer for 'em
,Consequence when you ain't there for him
,
,Were you there for him
,
,Did you care for him
,
,You were dead wrong
,
,Don't you come back no more
,So say goodbye and hit the road
,Pack it up and disappear
,You better have some place to go

,
,Let me say goodbye to my demons
,Let me say goodbye to my past life
,Let me say goodbye to the darkness
,Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
,
,Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
,Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
,And I still keep raising the bar like
,Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
,Goodbye to the stereotypes
,You can't tell my kings we can't
,Mandem we're linking tings in parks
,Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park
,Like goodbye to my old hoe's
,Goodbye to the cold roads
,I can't die for my postcode
,Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
,And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
,Gang
,So say goodbye and hit the road

,Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
,Who, are you to tell me if it’s black or white?
,Mama, can you help me try to understand
,Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
,My daddy lived a lie
,Its just the price that he paid
,Sacrificed his life, just slaving away
,Ohhh, if there’s one thing I hang onto
,That gets me through the night
,I ain't gonna do what I don’t want to
,I'm gonna live my life
,Shining like a diamond
,Rolling with the dice
,Standing on the ledge
,Just show the wind how to fly
,When the world gets in my face
,I say, have a nice day
,Have a nice day
,Take a look around you, nothings what it seems
,We’re living in a broken home of hopes and dreams
,Let me be the first to shake your helping hand
,Everybody, brave enough to take a stand
,I knocked on every door, on every dead end street
,Looking for forgiveness
,What’s left to believe?
,Ohhh~
,Now when this world keeps trying, to drag me down
,I've gotta raise my hands
,Gonna stand my ground
,I say, hey, have a nice day
,
,
,As a child you would wait
,And watch from far away.
,But you always knew that you'd be the one
,That work while they all play.
,In youth you'd lay
,Awake at night and scheme
,Of all the things that you would change,
,But it was just a dream!
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town.
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town
,From dust.
,Will come
,When you'll have to rise
,Above the best and prove yourself,
,Your spirit never dies!
,Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
,But don't weep for me
,'Cause this will be
,The labor of my love
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town.
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town
,From dust.
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town.
,Here we are, don't turn away now,
,We are the warriors that built this town
,From dust.

搞不清楚她想些什么东西
舞池中badbitch当做空气
发动最浪漫的爱情攻击
不论怎样她都不会同意
不要在我背后说我坏话
我的家里等着你去开发
你是软肋 也是铠甲
你是软肋 也是铠甲

,like money，like cool shit 总是被人误解
,我到底是什么人 标签复杂到吐血
,你的眼神开始好奇 小心行为出界

,Verse1
,当我写下第一句韵脚 不是为了名和利
,在文字里玩弄着花招 抚琴摆下空城计
,生活有太多不如意 太多的人 他们浑身是戏
,如果能得到片刻安宁 take me to the peace
,我在鼓点里一路向西 身经百战 都笑我放荡不羁
,时光如白驹过隙 一声空叹 太多人各奔东西
,黑夜里兜兜转转 早已习惯 立场已危在旦夕
,太多的内忧外患 头绪太乱 只待我反戈一击
,你只能尽早投降 看我来独霸一方 
,势不可挡 柔中带刚 韵脚能倒海翻江
,用我的舌剑唇枪 博一个盖世无双 
,战场上万夫不当 他日也衣锦还乡
,下笔如神助 出口成章 身上有万丈的光
,行云如流水 巧舌如簧 跳出了世俗的框 
,充分的 发挥着 干脆又 尖锐的 世俗都敬畏 的强大韵脚
,看我这 干脆的 绚丽的 玫瑰色 眼花又缭乱 的花哨技巧

,Verse2
,当他们还站在原地 我已经在赛道漂移
,我的歌词就像有魔力没法模仿就像被加密
,你真的不用去在意 我和你之间的差距
,如果这是一场游戏 马里奥已经吃够了金币 
,当我言辞犀利的叙述 人们称它们为艺术
,总有一天我的每一首说唱都将会被人们记住
,说唱像托尼史塔克的技术 钢铁侠华丽的让人都嫉妒
,人们称我为superhero 每个孩子眼神里都羡慕
,我要靠我的说唱来发家致富
,歌词快到你不得不去看字幕
,震惊整个大陆 把城堡 加固
,灵感如泉涌从来都不靠药物
,初出茅庐 你也抵挡不住 还没报姓名就送你上路
,靠嘴上功夫 出入江湖 拥有王者的气度

,Hook
,like money，like cool shit 总是被人误解
,我到底是什么人 标签复杂到吐血
,你的眼神开始好奇 小心行为出界
,我是狩猎场的huntsman 你活不过今夜

,Verse3
,用动人的Melody 吸引你的主意 拿起了麦克风上天入地
,说唱界万人迷 歌词像辛弃疾 flow 太高端到无人能及
,像高渐离一刀致命 碰到我千万别心存侥幸 
,如今的ya dont know me yeah 总有一天我会一呼百应
,就算碰到山 我也照样搬 靠自己的本事 扬高帆
,步履都阑珊 就算路不宽 死多少次 我都要通关
,用绊脚石当脚下铺路的青砖 所以我一马平川
,路在我脚底 而你在井里 所以我比你更高端

,干嘛听苦情歌以为多浪漫
,再浪漫都被拆散
,说要平平淡淡
,长路漫漫一起再共患难
,
,高脚杯 在陪伴
,以为决定 多果断
,在青春 快过半的阶段
,失去了对爱的基本判断
,问我什么是爱
,是初亚当和夏娃 开心咬下苹果
,问我谁在抵赖
,是时间是金钱是你解不开的屏锁
,这场战役都没赢过
,航行中你无法停泊
,争吵从未停过
,但是彼此内心
,在不停祈求停火
,每个起因都有经过
,今后剧情是堂新课
,倔强的看不清回忆那曾经
,一分开就怪给星座
,失落的自己总责怪自己
,在黑夜中怒吼
,如果我是你会说我爱你
,在左转的路口
,说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
,
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,
,就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
,我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
,
,怎么一不小心太疯狂
,
,用哪种方式纪念
,算最好的祭奠
,还会想跟你见面
,虽然只剩这张照片
,有开端就有结尾
,也许是一个机会
,在这匆匆流逝的岁月中
,你是记忆劫匪
,
,我想说声感谢
,毕竟你是最美好的节目
,多少次哽咽
,你的温柔我还一直记得住
,没有所谓对与错
,直到今天走到这一步
,所有怀疑都陨落
,当回头看走的这一路
,曾经爱过你恨过你
,想过你厌过你骗过你
,不停讲道理找刺激
,搞猫腻深陷这漩涡里
,现在 陪你迎风跑
,谁是你的避风岛
,如果不能问声好
,就让我来做你至尊宝
,说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
,
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,
,就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
,我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
,
,怎么一不小心太疯狂
,
,别后悔 就算错过
,
,在以后 你少不免想起我
,
,还算不错
,
,当我不在你会不会难过
,
,你够不够我这样洒脱
,
,说不上爱别说谎
,深夜的徘徊是思念在捣乱
,就一点喜欢
,
,谁先放手谁又将给谁好看
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,烛光的对视变一个人的早餐
,将一切都体谅 将一切都原谅
,酒后的你又在对谁在期盼
,我尝试找答案 而答案很简单
,跳出爱的苦与疯
,很痛也必须放你走
,简单得很遗憾 因为成长
,我明白谁都有苦衷
,毕竟我牵过你的手
,我们逼不得已要习惯
,长大的过程中会有雷雨暴风
,
,那就珍惜每一秒每当你在我怀中
,因为成长 我们忽尔间说散就散

,当我睁开眼睛 太阳已经下山
,早就不再年轻 熬夜后的负担
,洗去身上的血迹 换过新的床单
,好像一切没有发生过 太阳没上升过
,他财迷心窍装做没事打闹嬉笑
,再脏的钱都收他看似苦恼其实心在笑
,他的心眼太小 看到的只是外表
,还太早 不知道自己是谁 他还在找
,他也是上帝的孩子吗
,我怎麽想要把他换掉 脱罪以后表情依然的自然
,以他的智商 可以逃过这世上 所有的罪不够让他受 就算全身是伤
,试图脱罪的人 蒙羞祖先的魂 在挖掘魔鬼的坟 以为能灌醉了神
,他的家在哪 没把话讲真 听著音乐 他们只能继续等
,他说
,他只是想要脱罪 难道这样不行吗
,他只是想要脱罪 有谁能够原谅他

,我说 跪下吧 跪下吧 神的孩子
,主 请祢让他 对天微笑 感受 祢的仁慈
,让他的心可以重头 像是溪流清澈的源头
,其实他 并没有错 只是被人怂恿
,他的心有太多恨 不愿意尝试了解就先下定论
,受够了这些鸟事 不想被笑笨
,他只想要相信人 但是遇到的都是好人 那也不见得
,就算站在悬崖边 有绳子不愿抓
,昧著良心讲话 好话也不愿夸
,他们不是帮派 但是捨不得拿下真面具
,唯有武装自己才能得人尊敬不变的定律
,他不想被取笑 总是被人比较
,他只能树立敌人才显得没乱阵脚
,他需要归属 不是选边
,主请祢让他用祢的眼光看这世界 AMEN
,他只是想要脱罪 难道这样不行吗

,看我团云吐雾会有轻功，
,双脚没离地，但感觉凌空，
,她们叫我最特别的兵种
,报告行踪 ，就像在树林中，
,暂时把烦恼都全部清空

,所有烦恼琐事在身边不停的转
,就连手机屏保我都开始懒得换
,不收拾房间杂物一天比一天更乱
,跟他们不同，我吃太多会胃痛
,体重开始逐渐下降连身材都变了样
,我想要灵魂跟身体同步多一点
,比如慢一点，在慢那一点点
,倒数三秒我们一起chill
,如果离开氧气没有救
,简单的问题但是 I dont know
,最大困难就像昨天喝的酒
,不太擅长交谈所以瞧着键盘
,生命像个漩涡所有都在旋转
,离开只有两个字但很简短
,但伤口却依旧还是没有减缓

,就像思绪在云中，
,摇晃身体，所有的想象都凭空，
,做着梦，但依然最美留心中
,黑色沙发搭配白色装点，
,欢迎你来到我家客厅房间
,华丽的就像侏罗纪时间商店，
,如果你愿意，呆就旁边。

,你是脱了缰的野马 可惜我没有草原 朋友劝我可别傻她的笑真的好甜
,虽然我们不够般配 我大了你足足三岁
,我还记得你父母特别干脆的问我 你来自哪个单位
,我知道那一秒种你的心里也不太好过
,纸里包不住火 地下恋情被挑破
,如果这是一场梦 请不要把我叫醒
,优柔寡断的我只能够 看着你倒影
,i feel my pain 你知道的 我总是不善言表
,我已经透支了全部 可是他们还是嫌少
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应我你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样会让我心碎
,我还是把你当成了我的至宝
,可你依旧选择离开让我如何是好
,虽然我不能够继续陪在你身边
,I just wanna 至少让能把你思考
,离别的话很少 一共没两句
,可是我还没有 拿到我的奖励
,那可能是朵花
,可能是温暖的家
,可能是人海中迷路的那个只属于我的她
,突然觉得自己多余 好像是末日来临这个世界
,发誓不再把你说起 我决定忘记你的一切
,在浪涛中跌跌撞撞 一个人闯荡
,如果不想看到我的泪水请你把后视镜给档上
,时刻提醒自己为了你 我不能够继续反抗
,白天很煎熬更何况是没有你的晚上
,深夜中一个人买醉
,心被掏出来狠狠的踩碎
,你带给我的痛苦比幸福竟然还多了百倍
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚

,找不到最初的方位
,眼睁睁看着爱被抽空
,你离别略显的干脆

,龙胆紫
,跟着来自心跳的节奏
,漫步在黄金年代的街头
,Purple Soul and loop
,龙胆紫再次带你回到内时候的flow
,说实话谋杀了人的思想强制洗脑之后的伟大领袖
,统治我的祖国熟悉的梦带着光划过眼前
,直到窗外的噪音打扰了我的睡眠你发现
,我也发现了你所有经历遭遇的和我相同相似的在想的问题
,这么大的地球自由的人受委屈
,贪得注入苦海下面是地狱别装逼
,谁想去你离开我继续得把注意力转移
,翻来覆去考虑想化解自私与矛盾被误会滋养的根
,得罪的装的真的藏的深的像针
,谁怕被扎破了除非你是玩了命的时代机器
,还在得意着保了密的劳动积蓄不可操之过急
,这个社会主义目的让你骗了自己
,新的开始 keep underground loop
,别冲动这不是你最想走的路
,在城市里被现实打败的过程
,自以为是与众不同可谁知道疼
,这种态度 Purple Soul在保护
,DJ MC涂鸦和你的舞步
,自然紫色的疗伤药水儿治你的疼
,除非你伤口干燥的已经化脓
,还是按老规矩keep fire burning
,点燃Jah的火焰燃烧巴比伦的城市
,如果无耻已经成为你生活的方式
,那么我想让你看看什么才是活的真实
,每个身上的伤疤都代表着什么
,别拿出来炫耀了好吗至少你现在还活着
,可能最疼的感觉你早就已经忘了
,但是我保证还有更新的良心说唱
,龙胆紫来自自然生活在城市
,根儿在地下家在ghetto混在街头
,在内时候我没有别的选择只有拳头
,但是我现在举起拳头是为了自由
,紫色灵魂帮你止血消毒
,给你一个伤疤是为了让你以后记住
,当爱的力量大过于对力量的爱
,这个世界将会和平你才会感到自由
,站在自己的hoodI represent my crew
,江湖人士过河卒，路是不归路
,所有兄弟们都清楚但没办法这是我们自己选择的路
,那好吧original soldier keep fire
,这是我们的cypher 兄弟们都在这儿
,你看看他们身上哪个还没点儿伤呢
,哪个不是天天希望自己兜里揣把枪就像
,我们的说唱能够以柔克刚
,先花了你的概念再乱了你的气场
,这些伤留在心里让你不能痊愈
,就像我们的简历上面儿写着进过监狱
,都是受过伤的经历了太多悲剧
,谁不想变强壮好面对过去
,无法逃避的我们需要keep it real
,听听新的节奏这就是purple soul
,像是一种染料改变了原来的lifestyle
,或者说是一种药
,没有任何毒性没有任何副作用放在我的伤口上还能防止化脓
,谁都知道大的道理大家谁都懂但遇事儿就犯懵好了伤疤忘了疼
,我们可以不尊重自己的身体
,但别忘了最深的伤口是在心里
,这是新的开始keep underground loop
,别冲动这不是你最想走的路
,在城市里被现实打败的过程
,自以为是与众不同可谁知道疼

,那种喜欢亲密的称呼总是轻易的相信
,谁都知道不会是你专用
,那种嫌弃自己原本长的样子以为换张脸就可以得到以前得不到尊重
,可惜空乏的自卑
,生活充杂着是非
,直到最后才发现是场春梦
,而我喜欢那种不用化的浓妆艳抹已经可以让我视线范围能看到的只有她
,yeah

,有点神秘
,情绪都不留痕迹
,特别容易让人沉溺
,越难实现的越是迷恋
,甚至希望你是偏门的没有人气
,你的存在旁人无法代替
,不管他们模仿的多么卖力

一不小心弄丢了曾经的初恋
记忆中那张青春荡漾的脸
经常在心里不经意的回旋
祈求上苍让我们再次遇见

不想岁月淹没那张熟悉的脸
怕模糊了梦里长长的缠绵
是不是心有所想千次默念
看那熟悉的身影闪过眼前

一帘幽梦在现实中出现
记忆中那对诱人的眼
多了点成熟魅力不减
勾起我心底深藏的爱恋

回忆第一次亲吻你的脸
你羞涩的闭起了双眼
心里的甜蜜再次涌现
紫藤花开再次爬满心间

最美的情郎

词：玉镯儿

今夜东山顶 升起了皎洁的月亮
你用不老的月光 写下情诗两行
一行化作了殿前 悠远的藏香
一行凝结成眼中 清澈的泪光
  
今夜理塘 是谁的歌声在回荡
让仙鹤的翅膀 带你飞到我身旁
你说只愿和有情人 做快乐的事
我**在时光里 等你为我梳妆
  
雪域里你是最大的王
人世间你是最美的情郎
你是我心上最温暖的念想
就像拉萨城最明艳的阳光
  
雪域里你是最大的王
人世间你是最美的情郎
如果前世今生都终将错过
我会等你在**的路上
  
我不爱雪域里最大的王
只爱你世间上最美的情郎

我是真的不想分开
心里是那么的伤怀 
求求你珍惜我们的现在
让我在感受到你的爱

爱不是践踏和伤害 
真情需要真爱来灌溉 
难道上辈子欠了你的债 
要我用一生补偿等待 

你真的真的是我的爱 
却让我深深陷进苦海 
我不知道是继续还是离开 
心痛的感觉无法说出来
            
你真的真的是我的爱 
却把我绝情的来伤害 
昔日的柔情蜜意已经不在
多想重温初恋时的那种爱

双目凝望天边星
方知黄粱人无影

梦离别离别梦中
可恨小楼又东风
未曾折柳来相送
怎就甜蜜已成空

梦离别离别梦中
谁把缱绻化成空
不求能许山海盟
只盼有缘再相逢

我们有最美的相遇
丁香中寻找五瓣的真谛
天空下着毛毛细雨
原来幸福可以偶遇

你就是我梦里的鱼 
心的海洋任你而游弋 
我是鸟儿伴你飞翔 
守护着你平安嬉戏

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
我们的相遇就注定了结局
是上天安排这游戏
不是谁要把谁遗弃

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
相遇就注定了今天的结局
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍 

……间奏……

我们有刻骨的分离
冬日雪花夹着冰冷的雨
相对的目光在游离
破碎在这寒冷冬季

你是要远行的游鱼
心儿向往神秘的海底
水面蒙上冰做的墙
风儿催我他乡栖息

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
我们的相遇就注定了结局
是上天安排这游戏
不是谁要把谁遗弃

我是候鸟你是洄游的鱼
相遇就注定了今天的结局
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍
我们没有足够的法力
把完美翅膀幻化成鳍
我们注定了分离

,(Uh huh, it's all good)
,
,Now this ain't the name calling game
,See, I can refrain from using names to get paid
,Since I'm known to creatin kinds of beats that make your rump shake
,Records are great, But now let's set the record straight
,
,(They thought you was a sellout)
,I'm sellin' out tours cause sellin' CD's, I'm the one M. B.
,You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
,In the backseat of my caddy you'll be callin' the Hammer daddy
,
,I'll work you like a slave,
,Misbehavin' you were gonna,
,Pay tax on? my brothers soul
,
,Hit the streets cornered?
,And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
,But face to face was a just a trick, bro
,
,They put me in the mix, Too legit to quit
,I came wit' a long list of it
,And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
,Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards
,And it's all good.
,
,(Hey...)
,(It's all good)
,
,Y'all ready for this?
,
,(Uh huh, it's all...)
,(Hey...)

,The talk you been talkin',
,To talk that talk,
,You gotta walk that walk.
,
,Or the Hammer man's stalkin', So enter the dragon
,And once you burned up, Those? caught in dissin my bandwagon.
,
,Suckers, read billboard and weep,
,You in the hot seat where I'm from talk is cheap
,And when I see ya, The styles you wrote man
,A mean left hook took ya out, And it came from Oakland.
,
,Check it, You punks don't know me
,A true O.G. Yo, I was runnin" the whole scene
,You started talking all that mess But I'm callin" your bluff trick
,I thought you new And boy you still can't touch, this
,
,It's better than the average, bro.
,I'm not the average Joe, With the average flow.
,Yo I can still do things That you wish you could.
,You're talkin' all that lip, But I don't even trip,
,'Cause it's all good.
,
,Chorus
,
,I'm fed up, So now I gotta set 'em up.
,Knock em till I never, never ever let 'em up.
,But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up.
,However, if you wanna slang em, Then we can get 'em up.
,Black sheep you're weak you're meek You're tryin' to grow feet,
,? I make ya look head But first, I'm a get your teeth
,Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line red
,Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'm a blow your mind, So!
,
,Since I'm not the one who could be I'll
,I feel the need say 'you wanna be' you gotta be real.
,Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say,
,Homeboy you better pray just to make it today.
,
,I know what it is
,The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin we don't find worth playin
,I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
,When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out.
,And it's all good.
,
,Chorus
,
,I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
,P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
,Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
,All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,
,(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
,Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off the law, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
,I'm superman with the wind at his back
,Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
,Whos that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
,You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
,Throw him down pin him
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pain
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eye ball
,Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
,Once I was seven years old
,It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
,Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
,By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
,Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
,Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
,Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
,Once I was eleven years old
,I always had that dream like my daddy before me
,So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
,Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
,Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
,Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
,Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
,Once I was 20 years old

,I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
,Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
,I got my boys with me at least those in favor
,And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
,Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
,I was writing about everything, I saw before me
,Once I was 20 years old
,Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
,We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
,Soon we'll be 30 years old
,I'm still learning about life
,My woman brought children for me
,So I can sing them all my songs
,And I can tell them stories
,Most of my boys are with me
,Some are still out seeking glory
,And some I had to leave behind
,My brother I'm still sorry
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
,Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
,I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
,I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
,Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
,Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
,Soon I'll be 60 years old

,굳이 일어서야 할 필욜
,느끼지 못하고 지냈지
,넌 앞을 봐야 해
,두려움에 꺾이지 말어
,그건 니가 볼 중독 중
,가장 최악인 걸
,
,바라는 게 없었던 시절의 나는
,도화지였어
,뭘 원하지 않고 시를 써냈지
,그냥 그게 다였어
,밝은 날의 연속
,
,그래 그게 다였지 뭐
,나는 점점 더 욕망에 물들었고
,내가 하기 싫은 거에까지
,손을 대고 벌어
,벌을 궁리만해 털어
,놓을 곳은 없었지 뭐
,
,다른 곳을 볼 때면
,
,나는 사색에 잠겨
,이건 때론 아무것도 아닌 듯
,내 몸을 잠식하지
,위험했지 그랬어 난 때때로
,
,다른 이는 여기 나에 대한 얘긴
,하고 싶지 않아 해 봐봐
,
,누가 누굴 위할 때가 아냐
,너를 구해내
,해독은 전부 너의 몫이야
,
,뭐가 맞는지 넌 자세히 찾아 boi
,
,우린 답이 없는 문제 속에 살아
,You know it boi
,
,꿈은 약이야 치료제 따윈 없어
,You know it boi
,
,너가 보고 싶은 것만 봐
,넌 간절히 빌어 boi
,
,And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
,And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
,But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
,This I know, yeah, this I know
,She told me, "Don't worry about it"
,She told me, "Don't worry no more"

,And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
,And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
,All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
,This I know, girl, I know
,She told me, "Don't worry about it"
,She told me, "Don't worry no more"
,We both know we can't go without it
,She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

,It's in your eyes, a color fade out
, Looks like a new transition
, The starting up and shaking your ground
, Turning your head to see a new day calling
,
, Does it feel like a head to lean on?
, A snapshot from where you were born
, I'm looking for your hand in the rough
, You're caught in the wire
, Well, I'll lift you out
,
, Leading on the action
, Caught in a cell phone's rays
, Bleeding on a sofa
, Staring at the waistline
,He's coming and she knows it
, Even though she knows why
, Footsteps in the hallway
, Girl, you haven't got time
,
, You gotta get out
, Go far away
, You gotta get out
, Go far away
,
, Darkness in the bedroom
, Maybe she is resting up
, Maybe she was out late
, Just come back from the club
, I can't hear her breathing
, Something doesn't seem right
, Killer in the hallway
, We're living on a set time
,
, We gotta get out
, Go far away
, You gotta get out
, Go far away

, Rewrote my history

, And with the four letter word redefine what it means
, You only need one spark to start a fire
, You only need one heart to save life
, It only takes one word to get inspired
, Now when I think of love it’s redefined
, It was like water
, Slipping right through my hands

,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it

,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris

,许多个夜晚我已无法入睡
,闭上眼睛我会感到疼痛
,无论让自己疲惫 还是麻醉
,总会掉进迷惘深处
,我的爱你在乎 时有时无
,我的感觉冷漠 越来越模煳
,此刻我已陷入 深深恍惚
,突然一首 从天_传出
,那歌声 让我流泪
,那歌声 把我唤醒
,歌 里 唱 着
,伤心的人 不 要 哭
,我们都一样 生来孤独
,用你的微笑面对每一次 心 碎
,因为我们 生来孤独
,伤心的人 不 要 哭
,我们都一样 生来孤独
,用你的微笑面对每一次 心 碎
,因为我们 生来孤独
,曾经决定悄悄离去
,只有这样我才会停止哭泣
,可当我闭上眼睛 我依然迷茫
,我的灵魂 充满恐惧
,此刻我站在窗前望着外边
,车辆穿梭高楼闪烁
,伴着晶莹的小雨和那歌声
,我轻轻哼起这首歌
,那歌声 让 我 流 泪
,那歌声 把 我 唤 醒
,歌 里 唱 着
,伤心的人 不 要 哭
,我们都一样 生 来 孤 独
,用你的微笑面对每一次 心 碎
,因为我们 生来孤独
,伤心的人 不 要 哭
,我们都一样 生来孤独
,用你的微笑面对每一次 心 碎
,因为我们 生来孤独
,不是自由城市拥挤才去争取
,可我害怕还是同样的结局
,在每个地方 走走停停
,在彷徨中 来来去去
,现在我多想就这样离去
,带着深深疲倦随风而去
,化作一颗星星 挂在天际
,我会再次唱起这首歌
,那歌声让 我 流泪
,那歌声把 我 唤醒
,歌 里 唱 着
,伤心的人 不 要 哭
,我们都一样 生来孤独
,用你的微笑面对 每一次 心 碎
,因为我们 生来孤独

,把我的梦摇醒了
,宣布幸福不会来了
,用心酸微笑去原谅了
,也翻越了
,有昨天还是好的
,但明天是自己的

,却忘记了看清楚自己是谁
,我的宇宙轻飘飘 美的摇摇欲坠
,旁人来来去去像行云流水

,模糊糊的视线不管天色黑不黑
,心中没鬼就不用处处防备
,雨濛濛情深不深 只要醉醺醺的
,美不美只看能否爱的暧昧

,只要我以为 就不是误会
,谁都是宝贝 有什么真伪
,什么是是非 都似是而非

,只要我以为 就不是误会
,谁都是宝贝 有什么真伪
,什么是是非 都似是而非

,看不到命运 只看到滋味
,只看到绝色 看不到绝对
,最好的滋味就是耐人寻味

,下雨下的我 也像发呆
,你的道歉 听着听着我都快要笑出来
,谁说不能黑白配 世界上没有什么事能够如此的绝对
,曾经有人这样唱过 白天他不懂夜的黑 你却懂得我的美
,有时候我会 感觉非常累
,有时候也会 不自觉把你拖累
,你有时会说 我们不配
,只要能依偎 真的真的我什么都无所谓
,谁说不能黑白配 世界上没有什么事能够如此的绝对
,曾经有人这样唱过 白天他不懂夜的黑 你却懂得我的美
,钢琴也是黑白键 一样能弹出我对你只有满满的感谢
,也许黑永远不明白 在这片彩色的世界 有你我才会存在

,其实我怕你总夸奖高估我坚忍
,其实更怕你只懂得欣赏我品行
,无人及我用字绝重拾了你信心
,无人问我可甘心演这伟大 化身
,其实我想间中崩溃脆弱如恋人
,谁在你两臂中低得不需要身份
,无奈被你识穿这个念头 得到好处的你
,明示不想失去绝世好友
,没有得你的允许 我都会爱下去
,互相祝福心软之际或者准我吻下去
,我痛恨成熟到 不要你望着我流泪
,但漂亮笑下去 彷佛冬天饮雪水
,被你一贯的赞许 却不配爱下去
,在你悲伤一刻必须解慰找到我乐趣
,我甘于当副车 也是快乐着唏嘘
,彼此这么了解
,难怪注定似兄妹一对
,其实我怕你的好感基于我修养
,其实最怕你的私心窥准我体谅

,Hating on anyone, stuck in the process
,For God sakes, how long will you waste, it's non sense
,Telling you to give up on the dream, but who

,So let this song tell ya that it's never too late
,Wide awake, and I see more than ever
,That people are quick to give up on their endeavors
,Never really try 'cause they're scared of failure
,So, allow me to be the first to tell ya'
,I've failed more times than I've succeeded
,In the end, exactly what I needed
,To allow me to learn the right steps
,So I'd never go back, and I never regret
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't
,You say I can, I can
,When you fall, stand up
,And when you break, stand tough
,And when they say, you can't

,At once dead,
,Won't let them stop you in your tracks, at once dead
,Say to yourself, I'ma be stronger than
,Stay up late everyday working harder than
,Keep my head focused, stick to the plan

,Incredibly all dipsy,
,Until I'm falling to the floor,
,And I've let myself go.
,Get up, get up,
,We're painting flowers,
,All over our faces just for show,
,Sit down, chill out,
,We're taking hours,
,We'll cover the bases as we go.
,Feel the sun on your skin,
,I just want you to let your hair loose my dear.
,Oh my dear.

,It's a really good sign that you hold my mind
,It’s true
,And I’ve been thinking of what to say all night to you
,So you wanna be a man about it， do you?
,And have you figured out all you wanted, have you?
,When your heart becomes a million different pieces
,That’s when you all be able to recognize its feeling
,That’s called tough love
,That’s called tough love
,That’s called tough love
,That’s called tough love
,In the middle of the night
,All I think about is you
,I dream in all your clouds, so sorry
,It’s true
,So you wanna be a man about it
,Do you have to?
,And have you figured out all you wanted, have you?

,In the day
,In the night
,Say it right
,Say it all
,You either got it
,Or you don't
,You either stand or you fall
,When your will is broken
,When it slips from your hand
,When there's no time for joking
,There's a hole in the plan
,Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
,No you don't mean nothing at all to me
,Oh you got what it takes to set me free
,Oh you could mean everything to me
,I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
,I can't say that I don't
,love the light and the dark
,I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
,And all of what I feel I could show
,You tonite you tonite
,Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
,No you don't mean nothing at all to me
,Oh you got what it takes to set me free
,Oh you could mean everything to me
,From my hands I could give you
,Something that I made
,From my mouth
,I could sing you another brick that I laid
,From my body I could show you a place God knows
,You should know the space is holy
,Do you really want to go?
,
,We're the lifted boys and girls, and we are on a roll
,Listening to everything from grunge to rock n' roll
,Our feet don't touch the ground
,Fly like a plastic bag that's
,Lifted
,We inhale the helium and leave the shit below
,We don't get in traffic jams, we're shining on this road
,With sunshine on our faces
,We keep it super basic
,Lifted
,We got lifted on a Monday
,Then we floated away and it was Sunday
,All we want is to forget
,All we want is to forget
,We get high up on the low down
,Every day spinning like a merry-go-round
,All we want is to forget
,All we want is to forget
,Wake up every morning, we got troubles at our door
,We get lifted right away, no we don't touch the floor
,We want to see in color
,We want to feel each other
,Lifted
,Drifting through the day, no I don't make my mama proud
,She keep trying to talk to me, but I am in the clouds
,No, you don't feel the pressure
,Up here the air is fresher
,Lifted
,We got lifted on a Monday
,Then we floated away and it was Sunday
,All we want is to forget
,All we want is to forget
,We get high up on the low down
,Every day spinning like a merry-go-round

,醉里看百花深处愁
,莫把那关外野游，留佳人等候

,Hello darkness my old friend.
,I've come 2 talk with U again.
,Because a vision softly creeping.
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
,And the vision that was planted in my brain.
,Still remains.
,Within the sound of silence
,In restless dreams I walk alone.
,Narrow streets of cobble stone.
,'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
,I turned my collar 2 the cold & damp.
,When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light.
,That split the night.
,And touched the sound of silence.
,And in the naked night I saw.
,Ten thousand people maybe more.
,People talking without speaking.
,People hearing without listening.
,People writing songs that voices never share.
,And no one dare.
,Disturb the sound of silence.
,"Fool" said I "U do not know."
,"Silence like a cancer grows."
,Hear my words that I might teach U."
,"Take my arms that I might reach U."
,But my words like silent rain-drops fell.
,And echoed in the wells of silence.
,And the people bow & prayed.
,To the neon God they made.
,And the sign flash out its warning.
,In the words that it was forming
,And the sign said "The words of the prophers.
,Are written the subway walls & tenement halls".
,And whispered in the sounds of silence.
,They're selling postcards of the hanging
,And they're painting the passports brown
,Yeah the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
,The circus is in town
,And now well here comes the blind commissioner
,They've got him in a trance
,One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
,The other is in his pants
,And the riot squads are restless
,They need somewhere to go
,As Lady and I look out tonight
,From Desolation Row
,
,Cinderella she seems so easy
,"Well it takes one to know one" she smiles
,And she puts her hands in her back pockets
,Bette Taylor style
,And now here comes Romeo moaning
,"You Belong to Me I Believe"
,And someone says " You're in the wrong place my friend
,You better leave"
,And the only sound that's left
,After the ambulances go
,Is Cinderella sweeping up
,On Desolation Row
,
,
,Now at midnight all the agents
,And the superhuman crew
,Go out and round up everyone
,That knows more than they do
,So come on bring them to the factory
,Where the heart-attack machine
,Is strapped across their shoulders
,And then the kerosene
,Is brought down from the castles
,By insurance men who go
,Check to see that nobody is escaping
,To Desolation Row
,Cause I can't read too good
,Don't send me no letters no
,Not unless you gotta mail them
,From Desolation Row
,
,
,
,From Out Of Nowhere
,
,
,Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm
,You splash me with beauty then you pull me down
,Cause you come from out of nowhere
,My glance turns to a stare
,
,Obsession rules me, I'm yours from the start
,I know you see me, Our eyes interlock
,Cause you come from out of nowhere
,My glance turns to a stare
,
,One minute here and one minute there
,Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
,One minute here and one minute there
,And then you wave goodbye...
,Goodbye
,
,Sifting to the bottom, every day for two
,Energy funnels, all becomes you
,Cause you come from out of nowhere
,My glance turns to a stare
,One minute here and one minute there
,Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
,One minute here and one minute there
,And then you wave goodbye...
,One minute here and one minute there
,And then I wave goodbye...
,Goodbye!
,
,I'm aliveeeeeee!
,So you were 6 feet underneath me
,I feel the pulse, I swear you moved
,And digging deep, deep down
,And recognized how much you had to lose
,And if you wanna get out of here
,Wanna get out of here
,Save yourself

,Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
,
,When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life
,
,Dwelling on the past, from back when I was youngThinking of my school days and trying to write this song
,
,Classroom schemes and dreamsMan they couldn't save me
,
,Cos my days were numbered when I signed down on Ivy?
,
,Teenage kicks running out what could we doI still show respect to my boys who made it through
,
,And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
,Then giving him a signal So everyone could see Sunshine and shade
,
,Those girls I'd serenadeThinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave
,
,Hoping that those days would go on and on foreverEvery day something new
,Just friends running together But suddenly school ends Your teenage life gone
,
,All your mates are growing up now They're moving on
,
,And now I'm looking back I'll tell you what I know Do you listen to your teacher ?
,
,No I don't think so
,
,"What did you learn at school today?"
,
,That's what the teachers used to say
,
,But they don't know
,
,Don't understand, do they ?
,
,Why do they always give advice
,
,Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
,
,When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life
,
,Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine yeha yeha
,Ooh ooh ooh shine
,
,And if you give the kids time, they won't do the crime yo yo
,
,Won't do the crime
,
,Now my bad old ways Were during my school days Messing on those grade A's My life is just a haze
,
,I'm going through the struggle Five ten and kicking back So I could lock my flow Lace it up now on the track
,
,Oh yeh I felt the pain Whilst chasing all the fame I'm being told I'm nothing Just a player in the game
,
,But now I walk tall Stand proud for you to see I'm driving these fast cars It's five stars for me
,
,"What did you learn at school today?"
,
,That's what the teachers used to say
,
,But they don't know
,
,Don't understand, do they?

,The whole crowd goes so loud

,Date night, I'll make it.

, 作词 : Santiago Cozzano Garcia
, Y es que en mi cuento siempre pierde el bueno
, Aquel que da la vida por una señal
, Que diga que el corazón de ella sí es sincero
, Que diga que esa chica no le va a fallar
, Y uno de esos soy yo
, Uno de esos soy yo
, Por eso cuando me preguntan cómo voy de amor
, Retiro la mirada y les bajo la voz
, Porque nadie sabe que yo tengo una maldición
, Que siempre me rompen el corazón
, Y aunque el bueno sea yo
, prefieren al traidor
, Por eso no creo en el amor
, Te rompe siempre el corazón
, Te roba la felicidad
, Y en realidad no se merece esta canción
, No se merece mi atención
, Hoy decidí vivir feliz
, Bebiendo para no sufrir
, Ahogando así mis lágrimas
, Y es que en verdad ya estoy perdiendo la razón
, Ahogando penas en alcohol
, Y por quien quiera que me quiera
, Yo ya de todas maneras
, No pienso caer en la trampa de historias pasajeras
, Ahora seré feliz
, Amor es fuera
, Ya no seré ni un cualquiera
, No pienso darte más
, Ahora miro por mí
, Me toca disfrutar
, Ya no pienso más sufrir
, Ya no quiero perder más ni un solo momento
, Me dedicaré a amar lo que están diciendo
, Por eso no creo en el amor
, Te rompe siempre el corazón
, Te roba la felicidad
, Y en realidad no se merece esta canción
, No se merece mi atención
, Hoy decidí vivir feliz
, Bebiendo para no sufrir
, Ahogando así mis lagrimas
, Y es que en verdad ya estoy perdiendo la razón
, Ahogando penas en alcohol
, Por eso cuando me preguntan como voy de amor
, Retiro la mirada y les bajo la voz
, Porque nadie sabe que yo tengo una maldición
, Que siempre me rompen el corazón
, Y aunque el bueno sea yo
, prefieren al traidor
,

,Tu lo sabes mama
,Electro latino
,Baby don’t stop

,Y es que no puedo evitar
,Pegarme lento al bailar
,Y yo la quiero besar
,Y entonces pido un poco mas,
,Dame un poco mas de lo que tu das,
,Quiero un poco mas.
,A mis 18 anos he vivido tanto, He besado tanto
,Tu me deseas yo se que te encanto
,Y ahora que se lo he contado, Se a olvidado ya no es tanto
,Y yo te quiero tu lo estas notando (Electro latino).
,Y es que no puedo evitar
,Pegarme lento al bailar
,Y yo la quiero besar
,Y entonces pido un poco mas,

,Y es que no puedo evitar ieh ieh
,Yo solo te quiero amar ieh ieh
,Y yo ya soy mayor de edad ieh ieh
,Me estoy enamorando.
,(Dimelo)
,Como puedo hacer
,Para que seas mia de una vez
,Yo quiero que esta noche salga bien
,Y la vida se me pase sin querer.
,Como puedo hacer
,Para que seas mia dimelo
,Hagamos el amor nosotros dos
,Tu cuerpo con el mio entran en calor,
,Oye piensame,
,Yo quiero ser el unico
,Que a ti te va a envolver
,Que las canarias sean un mundo
,Que te hagan perder,
,No olvides ni un segundo
,Que yo soy tu hombre.
,(Danny romero)
,Y es que no puedo evitar
,Pegarme lento al bailar
,Y yo la quiero besar
,Y entonces le pido un poco mas,
,Dame un poco mas,
,De lo que tu das.
,Y es que no puedo evitar
,Pegarme lento al bailar
,Y yo la quiero besar
,Y entonces pido un poco mas,
,Dame un poco mas,
,De lo que tu das,
,Quiero un poco mas.

Contigo no sentire el dolor
Buscare la formula cada dia cada dia
Hasta perder la razón (x2)
Es que me entristece todo este asunto
De no poder estar juntos
Mi corazon es casi difunto
Por eso me pregunto
Como curar (Como curar)
Le Puedo Jurar… (como yo)
Que la voy a amar
No lo dudas…
Tu tienes capacidad
Pa’ saber que digo la verdad
Por una eternidad

Si tú te vas
Si te marchas
Y me dejas solo
Si tú te vas, de mi que será (x2)

,
,Hope when the moment comes,
,
,you'll say...
,
,Hope that you spend your days,
,
,but they all add up
,
,And when that sun goes down,
,
,hope you raise your cup
,
,Oh, I wish that I could witness
,
,all your joy and all your pain
,
,But until my moment comes,
,
,I'll say...
,
,With every broken bone, I swear I lived.
,
,With every broken bone, I swear I...
,
,I, I did it all.I, I did it all…
,ooh ooh ooh ooh……
,
,
,
,
,
,
,The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
,It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
,I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
,And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
,No I don't want to fall in love
,No I don't want to fall in love
,With you
,With you
,What a wicked game you played
,To make me feel this way
,What a wicked thing to do
,To let me dream of you
,What a wicked thing to say
,You never felt this way
,What a wicked thing to do to
,Make me dream of you
,And I don't want to fall in love
,No I don't want to fall in love
,With you

,AndI don't want to fall in love
,No I don't want to fall in love

,
,Have you seen a day without the dark
,Did you wonder why it's still here
,While I’m still reflecting in your fear
,Strangers light up the atmosphere
,Let it go let it out let it steam let it flood
,Let it go
,When I say L.O.S .LO.S Angeles
,When I say L.O.S .LO.S Angeles
,When you fall down there’s no way at all
,It’s time to let it go let it out
,When I said so
,When I say L.O.S .L.O.S. Angeles
,Have you seen the night full out of space
,While I’m dreaming of the moon
,I’m still wondering if there’s a place unknown
,Let it go let it out let it steam let it flood
,Let it go
,When I say L.O.S .L.O.S Angeles
, L.O.S .L.O.S Angeles
,When you fall down there’s no way at all
,It’s time to let it go let it out
,When I said so

,
, April, I can hear your anger a-marching
, Here it comes again
, And the flowers will forgive your rage and your barking
, Here it comes again
,
, The grass is dying, and the water comes to revive it
, Here it comes again
, The great whisper across the plains gives to thunder
, Here it comes again
, Lower the curtain, let the rain come down like a spirit
, Let it hit the ground
, Come the memories, come the shivering cold, let the rain fall
, It's the devil we know
, It's the devil we know
, It's the devil we know

,Looking at it now
,It all seems so simple
,We were lying on your couch
,I remember
,You took a Polaroid of us
,Then discovered
,The rest of the world was black and white
,But we were in screaming color
,And I remember thinking…
,
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?

,
,Looking at it now
,Last December
,We were built to fall apart
,Then fall back together
,Your necklace hanging from my neck
,The night we couldn’t quite forget
,When we decided
,To move the furniture so we could dance
,Baby, like we stood a chance
,Two paper airplanes flying, flying…
,And I remember thinking
,
,Are we out of the woods yet?

,Oh, I remember..
,Oh, I remember..
,
,Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
,Twenty stitches in a hospital room
,When you started crying
,Baby, I did too
,But when the sun came up
,I was looking at you
,Remember when we couldn’t take the heat
,I walked out, I said “I’m setting you free”
,But the monsters turned out to be just trees
,When the sun came up
,You were looking at me.
,You were looking at me… Oh
,You were looking at me.
,I remember.
,You were looking at me
,I remember..
,Oh, I remember..

,This is for my number one
,This is for my number one
,True baby for I adore
,
,This is hard to say
,I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
,Cuz lately I been busy a lot
,And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
,I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
,Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
,Now I talk real foul and slick
,Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"
,Back in the days I was your number one pick
,Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix
,I had to dig deep inside myself
,Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
,It's a long journey back to the place we was
,When I was too embarrased to admit I was in love
,And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
,I can't let us self-destruct
,Baby smile today
,Cuz I been on that journey always
,I'm gon' love you better
,When your friends'll see you too
,Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
,I'm gon' love you better
,
,When I think about the things we did
,And I think about you having my kids
,And I think about us sharing a crib
,Losin' all that, God forbid
,You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
,In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
,Instead I walk around like I'm a king
,And having you ain't nothing but a thing
,I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
,Too busy frontin' in the hood
,Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
,I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
,One more chance baby and don't say no
,Cuz I got another side to show
,Some say love is painful it helps you grow
,Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know
,Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
,Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
,So let's laugh together, cry together
,God willin' we gon' die together
,
,It's a brand new me, a brand new you
,A brand new day, sky so blue
,Hold my hand while I walk with you
,Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
,No more games callin' you foul names
,Actin' like females is all the same
,I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
,From this day forward I'll never be the same
,I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
,I love you, lemme show you what I mean
,Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
,Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
,A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
,But this time I'ma do it right
,Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
,Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

,You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
,But you can't bring the truth to me
,****** you and all your expectations
,I don't even want your congratulations
,I recognize your false confidence
,And calculated promises all in your conversation
,I hate people that feel entitled
,Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
,Oh, you important?
,You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
,Mother******, I don't even like you
,Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
,That's how you find out who you dealin' with
,A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
,I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
,On my momma, that's the realest ************t

,Skin covered in ego
,Get to talkin' like a end-forth, like a rebound
,Got no end game, got no reason
,Got to stay down, it's the way that you making me feel
,Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
,You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
,If you do, I won't move
,I ain't just crying for no reason
,I ain't just praying for no reason
,I give thanks for the days, for the hours
,And another way, another life breathin'
,I did it all 'cause it feel good
,I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
,Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time

,you just like a drama
,oh baby
,
,Yeah
,I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
,But hey, what daddy always tell you?
,Straighten up little soldier
,Stiffen up that upper lip
,What you crying about?
,
,You got me
,Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
,Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
,I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
,I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
,Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
,Daddy's with you in your prayers
,No more crying, wipe them tears
,Daddy's here, no more nightmares
,We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
,Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
,Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
,We're all we got in this world
,When it spins, when it swirls
,When it whirls, when it twirls
,Two little beautiful girls
,Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
,I know it's confusing you
,Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
,I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
,The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
,All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
,Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
,We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
,But things have gotten so bad between us
,I don't see us ever being together ever again
,Like we used to be when we was teenagers
,But then of course everything always happens for a reason
,I guess it was never meant to be
,But it's just something we have no control
,over and that's what destiny is
,But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
,Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
,Now hush little baby, don't you cry
,
,Everything's gonna be alright
,Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
,We feel how we feel inside
,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
,But i promise momma's gon' be alright
,
,It's funny
,I remember back one year when daddy had no money
,Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
,And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
,Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
,I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
,Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
,But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
,And at the time every house that we lived in
,Either kept getting broke into and robbed
,Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
,Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
,Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
,And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
,Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
,On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
,And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
,And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
,And flew you and momma out to see me
,But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
,Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
,And you and Laney were to young to understand it
,Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
,I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
,Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
,Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
,Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
,To see how much you both have grown,
,it's almost like you're sisters now
,Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
,Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
,I like the sound of that, yeah
,It's got a ring to it don't it?
,Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
,
,Now hush little baby, don't you cry
,Everything's gonna be alright
,Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
,I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
,We feel how we feel inside
,It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
,But i promise momma's gon' be alright
,
,Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
,And if you ask me too
,I'mma give you the world
,I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
,I'mma sing for you
,I'll do anything for you to see you smile
,And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
,I'mma break that birdies neck
,I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
,And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad （haha）

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,
,Some days I just wanna up and call it quits,
,I feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
,Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
,My life's like one great big ball of shit,
,If I could just put it all in to all I spit,
,Instead I always try to swallow it,
,Instead of staring at this wall and shit,
,While I sit writers block sick of all this shit,
,Can't call it shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
,If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
,This is it, last straw, that’s all, that’s it,
,I ain't dealing with another fucking politic,
,I'm like a skillet bubbling, till it filters up,
,I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
,Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
,My cup run'ith over I've done and filled it up,
,The pen explodes and busts and ink spills my guts,
,You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
,But I'm a show you, what, you gonna feel my rush,
,You dont feel it then it must be to real to touch,
,Build a dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
,Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up,
,Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be,
,I'm a make you hate me cause you ain't me,
,You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
,What you close minded fucks were to blind to see,
,Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
,Out this world and ain't no one out their mind as me,
,You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine,
,All I need's a line but sometimes,
,I dont always find the words to rhyme,
,To express how i'm really feeling at that time,
,Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes,
,It's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
,The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
,This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
,I'm desperate at my desk if I could just get the rest,
,Of this shit off my chest, again, stuck in this slump,
,Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped,
,But wait here comes something,
,Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
,Crinkle it up and throw that shit out,
,I'm fizzling now thought I had figured it out,
,Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
,But I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade,
,Sionide I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
,Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want,
,I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain’t a quitter,
,I'm a sit here till I get enough,
,For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point,
,Put some oil in your joints,
,Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
,An MC's worst dream I make them tense they hate me,
,See me and shake like a chain-link fence,
,By the looks of them you would swear Jaws was coming,
,By the scream of them you would swear i'm sawing someone,
,By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
,It's now or never and tonight It's all or nothing,
,Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
,He pinky promised, I dont think he's honest,
,I be back baby I just got to beat this clock,
,Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch,
,Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race,
,and I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face,
,Bitch, I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice,
,Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
,If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
,If I have half a chance I grab it, rabbit run.

,I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
,I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
,The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
,I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
,With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
,And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
,I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
,While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
,But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
,Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
,Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
,Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
,Door's open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
,Curtains catch fire, the house melts
,The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
,Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
,Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
,But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
,It got silent, then all these voices said
,"Come follow me into the pits of Hell"
,I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
,I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
,Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
,I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
,She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
,And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, Help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone"
But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

,(Intro: Diabolic)
,Forget what you knew
,Welcome to the muthafuckin' battlefield
,
,(Verse 1: Diabolic)
,I two-step with Lucifer, and ever since I started dancin’
,I’ve walked a fine line between Einstein and Charles Manson
,Starvin' in this famine with my stomach growlin'
,Like someone shoutin'
,A hundred thousand times louder than thunder poundin'
,Fuck around and I’ll punch your mouth in
,I’m king of the mountain
,With my life in this project like it's public housin'
,Countin' on the fact I firebomb entire songs
,And won’t stop until the world's inside my palm like Viacom
,Diabolic; I’ll supply the higher wattage via fiber optic wire
,Until you acquire some kinda knowledge
,'Cause life made me grow wiser than old-timers
,Hot-headed like the ghost rider behind a slow driver
,Sole survivor, flowin' lava’s second nature
,So don’t test, it's best to save your breath like respirators
,I’ll throw a punch at your ribs that gives your lungs asthma
,And has you pourin' out your guts faster than Dutch Masters
,Drunk bastard, past the point of no return
,Like Denzel trickin' Ethan Hawke into smokin' sherm
,Judgement overturned, held in court like Mordecai
,Immortalized when I make statues bleed and portraits cry
,I’ll go to war for mine, Rebel Army guard the border
,I’m in the trenches, barkin' orders like I’m Sergeant Slaughter
,Pray to Jesus H. for mercy, and plead your case
,'Cause on the frontlines you’re dead
,The second that you see my face
,
,(Hook: Immortal Technique)
,This is the frontline
,This is the dead zone
,Barely alive or in a box is how you head home
,This is the frontline
,This is the life that I chose
,I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load
,
,(Verse 2: Immortal Technique)
,They said that the success of my music was theoretic
,But my revenge is sweet enough to murder diabetics
,Eugenics Procter and Gamble credit racial science
,Couldn't produce a more aggressive intellectual giant
,Nephilim, bury 'em with the bullets left in them
,My heart is blacker than the children of Thomas Jefferson
,Blacker than back in the days of tar and featherin'
,A cancerous endocrine, the eagle that's American
,The hatchet and the sticks, the fascist emblem
,You could call it conspiracy theory, I don't give a motherfuck
,You could get your mother fucked
,National security's a code-word for cover-up
,Hold that down, I look at character, never let the color get to ya
,I got white Revolutionaries like Muslims in Chechnya
,Percussion thumpin' like the Russian Mafia over ya
,But even they know what it's like when you fightin' for Svoboda
,So whether Slavic or Islamic, vodka/gin tonic
,Drunken fantasies are cool, son, but here's the grim logic
,You niggas wanna play industry and starve to be rich
,Until they fuck you for millions like Paul McCartney's bitch
,My lions live inside a box like Jumanji
,Sikh niggas that'll stab you up like Indira Gandhi
,So never desecrate the space on which I meditate
,My thoughts rip through tank-armored metalplates
,And start to resonate
,To the spot where Moses caused the sea to separate
,The place that the Prophet Muhammad started to levitate
,The exact moment that Jesus rose dead awake
,And Siddhartha became the Buddha that regenerates
,Half a bar over, but I bring it home colder than dead soldiers
,Soul controller, holder of knowledge, so fuck Dianetics
,I'm like the whole library in Kemet with Annunaki genetics
,
,(Hook: Diabolic)
,This is the frontline
,This is the dead zone
,Barely alive or in a box is how you head home
,This is the frontline
,This is the life that I chose
,I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load
,
,(Outro: Immortal Technique)
,Yeah, motherfucker
,Immortal Technique, Diabolic
,This is the Frontline
,The people first; one time
,Thirty-two and a little somethin', ha ha ha
,33-Degrees, motherfucka
,Go home and figure it out

,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,Wasn't ready to be a millionaire, I was ill-prepared
,I was prepared to be ill, though, the skill was there
,In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
,It was 'bout bustin' raps and standin' for somethin'
,Fuck an acronym
,Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
,With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
,It ain't over 'til I say it's over - enough when I say enough
,Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up up
,I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
,When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
,Raise your hands up like it's 12 noon
,Nah, homie, hold them bitches straight up
,Wait until you dislocate a rotator cuff
,Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
,Nah, egos, I ain't deflatin' 'em
,Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
,I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
,And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
,To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
,They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
,I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter
,I can adjust, plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
,So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
,Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
,What, like I give a fuck
,I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
,To the side of a pump
,0 to 60 hop in and gun it
,Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin' 'em up
,And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
,And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
,Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bounce
,Stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut
,While I'm whiping my butt
,Cause I just shitted on the mic and like getting cut
,I get excited at the sight of my blood, you better fight with a nut
,Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
,Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier
,Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far
,Picture me quitting, now draw a circle and put a line through it, slut
,It's survival of what?
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,So get your ideas, stack your ammo
,But don't come unless you come to battle, jump in the saddle
,This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
,Lift, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
,Refuse to quit, the fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
,If I don't do this music shit I lose my shit
,Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
,It's all I know how to do
,As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
,But my respect is overdue
,I'm showin' you the flow no one used
,I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
,So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other traits
,So you'd better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
,Cause you'll never take my pride from me
,It’ll have to be pried from me
,So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
,But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
,Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
,And if you don't like me then fuck you!
,Self esteem must be fuckin' shooting through the roof
,Cause trust me
,My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
,I can see why the fuck I disgust you!
,I must be allergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze
,I just go atchoo then achieve!
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all

,When the sun rises
,I wake up and chase my dreams
,I won't regret when the sun sets
,Cause I live my life like I'm a beast
,I'm a mothafucking beast
,Ayo back to make you run around the game like its a fire
,I spit acid bitch like I got cyanide in my saliva
,Watch me wet and heat shit up like I'm a washer and a dryer
,While I beat you in your head until you tire
,(I'm a motherfucking beast)
,See the way we got all my niggas is open
, and it won't stay
,Got a nigga wilding like he in a bull pen
,Look at me wishing i had him hoping
,But I will diminish and I stop and I won't finish
,But I drop and always kill a nigga hotter than a skillet
,Think you're fucking with a god? You gotta be joking
,Every single time you niggas see me, step inside the do'
,Killing everything with a thousand gorillas, behind me so
,I suggest you bow to let your chick eat my salami slow
,While I continue to dazzle niggas in the hood with that tsunami flow
,Get back homie before you get snapped
,Even got a bitch strapped in the club with a snub nose
,While I make them black with a bang and then a crack
,Niggas in the head I'm back, everybody 'til the club close
,Haters I see you sitting over there
,That's why you see me blacking everywhere
,I'ma motherfucking beast

,I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems)
,I'ma motherfuckin' beast (you don't want problems with me)
,I'm a motherfucking beast right
,Homie welcome to the east side, where the killers reside
,We playing war games, please hide
,Ain't no signs of peace, so fuck a peace sign, we ride
,Bust shots from a car seat
,Or maybe hang you 'til your neck is broke
,Choke with you with a Stethoscope
,That's how I kill a motherfucker in a heartbeat on a dark street
,(I'm a motherfucking beast)
,I'm a motherfucking beast right
,Keep a 3-5-7 in the Levi's
,When the beef fries, House Gang hoodie is the disguise
,Look in these eyes, last thing you gonna see when the heat flies
,Yo, is it we dumb or is it the city we from
,Got us killing each other over these bread crumbs
,You fuck with me it's gonna be cranberry and 151
,This murder rap is red rum
,I done seen a nigga dumping with the pistol
,Pull a gunmen out the window of a rental situation, detrimental
,Little kids are getting caught up in the middle when the kill is accidental
,That's why I'm keeping a pistol, matter of fact capture my enemy
,Kidnap or slap him in the back of the Infinity
,Bandanas to mask the identity
,And start spazzing like Charles Manson on acid and Hennessy
,Fight back, attack me with energy
,Spiked bats will add to your injury
,When I write raps you have to have a Bachelors in Chemistry
,Or a Masters in Math to be in the actual vicinity
,To pass me up mentally, to match my agility
,From Aspen to Italy, I have the ability
,To send your ass to the Trinity
,Like death when it's after the Kennedy's

,People wanna know how I am still hungry
,But they don't know how the IRS hung me
,What do you do when they take all your money?
,Get green like Gumby, come back like a bungee
,All of my grief, it has made me unleash
,On a bum all opponents will cease
,So I'm yelling to the north, and the south, and the west and the east
,I'm a motherfuckin' beast
,When you don't have nothing
,Only other way that you go is to mad toughen
,The craft up in the lab buckin' up to the bad luck in a flash uppin' the cash stuffed in the bag
,And you gotta get it no matter what
,Don't got the money to put enough in ya gut
,I gotta be the killer, cause I was stuck in a rut
,My energy will never let 'em leave us in the dust
,The lupus killed my mother
,Something really stupid filled my brothers
,And now they beginning treating me ill like others
,When real life smothers, I kill like thuggers and bang
,Fighting my way on top of the game with the pain I write this
,I came to ice shit, I reign tonight, sit you hangin' lifeless
,I'm Strange and hype bitch, I aim when I spit
,For the win and I'm gonna increase
,The pressure when I'm having no peace, feel me!
,Because I gotta eat, I won't let that demons release, kill me!
,On your soul I will feast, you're gonna need a bishop or priest
,I am that monster comin' to get ya' to say the least
,I'm a motherfuckin' beast
,I'ma I'ma fuckin' beast!
,I'ma mothafuckin' beast

,To take a stand, to take a stand
,(It's been a ride)
,Everybody, everybody
,(I guess I had to)
,Come take my hand, come take my hand
,(Go to that place to get to this one)
,We'll walk this world together through the storm
,(Now some of you)
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,(Might still be in that place)
,Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
,(If you're tryin' to get out)
,Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
,(Just follow me, I'll get you there)
,You can try read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
,But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
,'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
,When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
,I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
,Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
,I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
,And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony
,No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
,From "Infinite" down to that last "Relapse" album
,He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
,Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
,Whichever comes first, for better or worse
,He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas
,His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got
,The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
,I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
,To take a stand, to take a stand
,Everybody, everybody
,Come take my hand, come take my hand
,We'll walk this road together through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
,Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
,Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
,I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
,You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth
,For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
,And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
,I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
,Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD, was "eh"
,Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
,Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
,All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow
,'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'
,I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
,But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
,Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
,This fucking black cloud still follows me around
,But it's time to exercise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now
,I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
,To take a stand, to take a stand
,Everybody, everybody
,Come take my hand, come take my hand
,We'll walk this road together through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
,Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
,And I just can't keep living this way
,So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
,I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
,I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
,I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
,Tryin' to put my life back together right now
,It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
,Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
,So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
,And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
,I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
,I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
,My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
,And drop dead, no more beef flingers
,No more drama, from now I wanna promise to focus only
,On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
,And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
,'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
,Or the corner club and lift the whole liquour counter up
,'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
,But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'
,And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
,To take a stand, to take a stand
,Everybody, everybody
,Come take my hand, come take my hand
,We'll walk this route together through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm

,前方漫漫的长路 回头已没有归途
,我已经踏上征途 相信一定有归宿
,无数个夜里一人辗转反侧
,内心忐忑不知前方还有多少坎坷
,波折 也要把自由与爱的火把传播
,路通到罗马再奏响胜利的凯歌
,麻木的人群 无知的臣民
,彷徨的呐喊 可能已经没人听
,没有传承美德只传承了劣根性
,没有信仰的我们该如何走下去
,你为何笃定你的认知就是对
,真实的历史 上面都有一层灰
,甚至一切都是虚构 就像楚门的世界
,傲慢和偏见 暴露了你的视野
,Oh No 该怎么救赎 说实话
,我真的也不太不清楚
,每个人都应该是你自己的救世主
,只希望征途上不会再有残忍的杀戮
,为了海平面上的那道光
,为了信仰签下了生死状
,大风大浪全给我一起上
,宁可死我也不投降
,为了海平面上的那道光
,为了信仰签下了生死状
,大风大浪全给我一起上
,宁可死我也不投降
,你说你看过星辰也看过流星落下
,亲吻我的脸颊叮嘱我别再做挣扎
,那些苟且怎么可能让我轻易作罢
,勇敢无畏的心从来不会害怕奸诈
,肮脏的勾当 低俗的趣味
,畸形的审美 粗鄙的社会
,浑浊的空气 充斥着异味
,荒蛮的故事 我无言以对
,别妄想堵住我的喉咙 割了脉我也一定不收手
,发自内心呐喊的嘶吼 紧紧握住了真实的拳头
,现实残酷人性难免伤了我的心
,只要还剩一口气 我必定将掉你的军
,渺小到不能回头 我只是过了河的兵
,为了麦田里的孩子 有颗纯良的心
,为了艺术唤醒良知 不再有那肮脏的交易
,为了我的家园 不止960万平方公里
,为了海平面上的那道光
,为了信仰签下了生死状
,大风大浪全给我一起上
,宁可死我也不投降
,为了海平面上的那道光
,为了信仰签下了生死状

,我想

,我想跟你说声不对起 我犯过很多错
,很多故事不能说 我想你也经历过
,曾经偷吃过禁果 在欲望里堕落
,把正义给错过 对黑暗低头懦弱
,我沉浸在不劳而获贪婪懒惰的思想
,傲慢 嫉妒 仇恨
,在我心中无限滋长
,不要见外 灵魂被贱卖
,酒囊饭袋的我 也没有人会善待
,当我翻山越岭 才发现是一切是徒劳
,飞过了地平线 也只是黑白日夜在颠倒
,活在人类动物园 动物个个饮血茹毛
,那还何必跟你拉扯 我要更亡命的奔跑
,我知道没有任何规则能够让我依靠
,所以我不再忏悔 浪费时间祷告
,为生存去争夺 不需要斟酌
,我尽情享受欲望带来放肆的快活

,这世上人与人之间本就分磁场
,每天新的思想 不暂停的滋长
,想要新的死党 想要金的滋养
,不可能 哪有真的万事如你意
,在不同体系 就会有不同起义
,就如同笔记 是自我灵魂洗礼
,每次凌晨提笔 行文几笔
,都是为了形成记忆记下范过的错
,曾腐烂过的我比你能看过的多
,于是人应该开始自我救赎
,把优势凑足 劣势扣除
,让精神世界渗透进五脏六腑
,这些借口 那些借口
,想为自己找你一定能找的到
,谁都别走 喝口烈酒
,问你自己心里的悔意怎么能跑的掉
,别再祈求原谅 只有你自己才能为自己解脱
,眼光看在前方 任何话语都别说
,你可以原谅别人吗 别人真的会原谅你吗
,我们能给谁原谅吗 我们在祈求谁原谅吧
,呵呵 自己吧

,And go out 'coz this is new
,But we pull at magnets that collide
,And here we are being true
,I can't breathe, your love is the key
,And I can't move, if you're not into me
,My body shakes to the rhythm of the beat
,When you say you are into me
,If my heart beat makes a sound

,什么生存意义想到没完没了
,你给我听好 想哭就要笑
,其实你知道 烦恼会解决烦恼
,新的刚来到 旧的就忘掉
,渺小的控诉
,只是证明生活并不无聊
,
,别让我知道
,其实你在背着我们偷笑

,Verse 1：
,昨夜梦回最初 那是初遇你的时候
,人山人海偏偏你就闯入我的眼眸
,开始疯狂的追求她们都说我不矜持
,追在你身后喊你名字就这么日复一日
,我怕你忘记了我 想方设法向你靠近
,你终于开口对我说话 缩短我们的距离
,那个时候很开心 好似只剩一厘米
,光明正大的缠你 虽是以朋友的名义
,后来你我之间 终于不再那么疏远
,你的每次邀请我从来都不拒绝
,好不容易才靠近你 想再多看你一眼
,好不容易能听你声音 求求时间再慢点
,送饮料的时候 偷拍你打球的样子
,潜入教室在你书桌偷偷写下我的名字
,想起你会傻笑 朋友说我像个傻帽
,你是如此完美 说不出哪点不好
,或许难过的原因是你把我当做透明
,或许你出现的那刻起我早就情不自禁
,为什么 会这样 我总是在问自己
,24个小时每分每刻想的全都是你
,她们说 单相思是个心酸的过程
,我想说的没错 你的每次拒绝都是那么心狠
,狠到我心痛 狠到我退后
,狠到我想放弃不想继续对你再做无用功
,Verse 2：
,我总是安慰自己 是你还不懂我的心
,总有一天你会发现我想要的不是朋友关系
,我总是安慰自己 你不是在逃避
,想让你明白你想要的我全都会给你
,直到有一天 你动态更新了牵手的照片
,是你和一个女孩 底下评论“真般配”
,想起你紧张追问我 逗女孩的秘诀
,而我当时傻傻以为是你喜欢我的表现
,想起你问我 你的性格是否让人讨厌
,若有所思的样子 我偷偷踮起了脚尖
,你变得不再高冷 我以为我是功臣
,学会了关心人 而我错当对我情愫生
,或许难过的原因是你把我当做透明
,或许你出现的那刻起我早就情不自禁
,为什么 会这样 我总是问我自己
,24个小时每分每刻想的全都是你
,她们说 单相思是个心酸的过程
,我想说的没错 你的每次拒绝都是那么心狠
,狠到我心痛 狠到我退后
,狠到我想放弃不想继续对你再做无用功
,Verse 3：
,我以为只要坚持不懈你一定会感动
,我以为我的每次暗示你一定都能懂
,我以为我是对的 我以为你是我的
,以为你口中的她 从来都没存在过
,我还是放不下你 做不到不去想你
,或许有天能入你心 心中还存一丝侥幸
,想起还是会很痛 你像包袱一样沉重
,在你身上栽了跟头 告诉我这全都是梦
,从开始到现在 原来我在演独角戏
,而你怎么忍心 让我输得这么彻底
,一败涂地 或许我该救赎的是自己
,you are my redemption 而我一直这么定义
,所以 so no i can not cry
,记得你说 不喜欢 懦弱的女孩
,我可以 I believe 相信一切都会过去
,可是 可是对不起 我真的好喜欢你
,或许难过的原因是你把我当做透明
,或许你出现的那刻起我早就情不自禁
,为什么 会这样 我总是在问自己
,24个小时每分每刻想的全都是你

,Verse 1:
,我也不知道为什么那么喜欢你
,终于相信有些事情总会情不自禁
,我没有办法控制自己一直在坚信
,你会被我所感动然后跟我在一起
,记得刚认识你的时候你很安静
,喜欢坐在角落望着天空呆呆眨着眼睛
,你是转学生坐在了我后面
,我喜欢叫你傻逼你却喜欢叫我喂
,你说我人际关系复杂你不想参与
,我说我喜欢你为什么你总是不信
,你喜欢跟我讲大道理我都认真听
,你说你很了解我可你却不懂我的心
,你说你不喜欢我的习惯我开始担心
,怕你讨厌我然后慢慢离我而去
,我像个神经病一直拼命喜欢你
,求你回过头看我为你有多么的努力
,你说你喜欢打球喜欢球场上的激情
,你说你也喜欢唱歌喜欢用歌发泄情绪
,我试着努力去喜欢你喜欢的东西
,当它们变成我的习惯而你又在哪里
,后来你有了女朋友每天都很开心
,你买给她礼物问我她会不会倾心
,我讨厌你可心里又犯贱忍不住去爱你
,我也说不上理由也许这就是病
,Verse 2：
,你喜欢玩LOL为了你我拼命的学
,你说要带我打人机可你为什么食言
,我问你我的每次告白你会不会感动
,你说感动可感动不是爱希望我能懂
,我笑着点头说祝你幸福和她要快乐
,现在的你却跟我解释说你跟她没有什么
,你总是喜欢熬夜所以总迟到
,我真的很喜欢你你别喜欢她好不好
,每次上网总会习惯给你发消息
,虽然你没有回复可我还是很开心
,直到有一天你说能不能别烦你
,说不上什么感受只是觉得很伤心
,我真的很想 很想让你看到我的努力
,我真的有在努力我真的有在想你
,你回我一个字也好就是不要不联系
,你不知道我多么想把自己唱给你听
,你不是十全十美你也有很多的缺点
,我安慰自己你会感动只是需要时间
,我想要的是你的爱不是你每次抱歉
,喜欢你是我的事你没错是我自己犯贱
,身边的朋友叫我放弃别再当神经病
,我说你已经成了我的心病无药可医
,我总是在错过后悔这次我想争取
,所以你是否愿意试着医好我的心病
,对任何事我都抱着三分钟的热度
,对你的喜欢能坚持多久我也不清楚
,我在想或许哪天累了自然就放弃了
,可为什么想起你我又狠不下心呢
,也许我真的有病对你那么死心塌地
,放弃了好多东西只为能俘获你的一颗心
,其实我最后悔的事情就是遇见你
,因为我没有想到我会如此爱你
,Verse 3：
,这些故事真实到让我害怕让我吃惊
,想忘记可是它们早已刻在我心里
,那白衬衫是否残留彩色笔的痕迹
,不是我太过任性而是我太过爱你
,最美的情话只说给最爱的人听
,我需要更多的勇气我还不想要死心
,我还是一样爱你不管有谁劝我放弃
,岁月无情 傻逼请让我继续
,喜欢你

,Verse 1:
,打开陈旧的电脑又一次敲起了键盘
,房屋中都是新的可生活都让我厌烦
,到底如何才能够把你全部都忘记
,五年的相识经历无论如何都无法放弃
,多么想见你一面看看几年来的改变
,还想要陪你完成去你梦想中的海边
,曾经约你出门游玩你从来不会说改天
,最深刻的一次我在网吧 你替我买烟
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱
,可我已把你输掉 可我已把你输掉
,Verse 2:
,我们第一次登山照片还在橱柜里面
,几年前最后的分手在一个下雨天
,种种的回忆 脑海中形成了很多的画面
,你不知道 我对你有多么挂念
,录的每一首Demo来自你送我的设备
,那时穷屌丝一个并且刚刚踏入社会
,你不嫌弃并支持想起来至今都落泪
,当初的年少轻狂致使我分不清错对
,太多的误会幼稚导致让我把你失去
,写很多歌但一半都是关于你的诗句
,我忘不了青春时所留下的每份记忆
,想要对你关怀说爱也许只能在梦里
,我知道你想要的不多只是图个安稳
,可当初的满腔热血只想在社会中翻滚
,到最后 任性的结果你选择了离开
,记得那杯白酒和那首 I want fly
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱
,可我已把你输掉 可我已把你输掉
,Verse 3:
,ye 有人说时间能够帮我磨灭一切
,可为何唯独我的思念一夜又一夜
,耳边还能想起你对我说的 一生一世
,这个美梦太漫长了做到 今时今日
,离开我这么久你是否会 感到遗憾
,那个他对你的好 你是否会习惯
,希望他知道你最喜欢的 不是汽水
,也许某一天我会出现但是我会闭嘴
,我明白 这失败你不怪我我不怪你
,最后我想说分手后我一直 还爱你
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱

,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你

,或许自己的心情 不再删除那记忆
,看不见你的时候 勉强的我好累
,从第一眼见到你的时候 就感觉很对
,那么也请你 给我一次机会
,不要让我每天带着安慰入睡
,你爱生闷气 却很少发飙
,可爱的时候会嘟着嘴对我撒娇
,我试着提过你穿起婚纱的样貌
,你总说不敢去想 说你还太小
,习惯了世界里只有你能影响我
,习惯了生活里只有你能陪伴我
,习惯了每天早上当你的闹钟
,习惯了你 说你离不开我
,你喜欢唱歌吗 我从前问过你
,觉得我神经吗 我也在问自己
,我只是害怕 时间让我错过你
,怕来不及抓着你 就让别人得到你

,不知道为什么 我变的很消极
,或许在某一天 你能碰巧听到这首歌
,希望那时候 我也能够把你抓着

,海南的冬天没有雪 但不影响他在开着花
,自从你走后 我回到了那个没有你的家
,就是在这个地方 我说我要娶了她
,你是我这一辈子 最最难忘的关卡
,我抱着吉他被暴雨淋伤
,到你家楼下为你四处游荡
,做了一个只会歌唱的傻瓜
,你才不是一个 没人要的女同学
,谁会不厌其烦的安慰 那无知的少年
,我走进了你的世界 别怪我太耀眼
,我愿意用十年奋斗 换你一小时的笑脸
,你当时特别的可爱 但能不能靠近点
,你不说真心话 你让我怎么为你大冒险
,爱本就是一场赌局 我输了一切输了你
,感谢你曾来过 陪我走完句末
,留下的温柔只是我曾爱过
,爱本就是一场游戏 怪只怪我太过认真有力

,最后过成一个破碎的自己
,人总要学着孤独 试着慢慢去长大
,遗憾就遗憾吧 当你重新回到这

,不会说我很受罪
,失眠中在夜晚下的滋味
,在感情中总有一方牺牲
,谁都不想做扑火的飞蛾
,对错究竟该如何区分
,而不是一味去配合
,忍让被你当成放纵的理由
,多少次把想说的话
,都烂在肚子里头
,失望都无限增大
,委屈全部都吞下
,把痛留给我来体验
,一次次逾越过我底线
,那就当做我在
,死皮赖脸的取悦你
,曾经如潮水般的爱
,一转眼到现在也已见底
,我的好不在仅限
,你的爱太奢侈我无福消受
,你就像本经书我始终都
,无法参透领悟
,就像雨后窗口为何起雾
,听得出你心里在抵触
,面对我的担心
,深夜的关机
,连接着我的喜怒
,夜晚下的琴声在此刻有多么应景
,风肆意的吹窗外下起了朦胧细雨
,有没有一种旋律会
,让你听到爱不释手
,如果思念是一种病
,我想那药该怎么入口
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应我你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样会让我心碎
,我还会常常去那家的路边摊
,和留有我们照片被你遗忘的
,甜品店
,********
,饭后送你鲜花
,送你的名牌包包
,项链花光我的所有钱
,那时我们想的还没有那么复杂
,只想睁开眼醒来时
,枕边就有你
,在野外烧烤时 我点火 你助燃
,酷夏时去海边度假租游艇
,时常挂嘴里念的那句随你便
,不会想着试探触碰谁底线
,babe是否我真的不和你意
,你的冷漠就像核武器
,ah sorry ****
,我并没表面那么深明大义
,身边资源很多
,当然从也不缺少大蜜
,我始终相信爱我的
,始终会爱我
,随便你怎么去快活
,大不了最后就散伙
,曾经把你当做我的一切
,在空荡的房间里
,的我醉倒的不止一遍
,渐渐的我们缺少沟通
,找不到最初的方位
,眼睁睁看着爱被抽空
,你离别略显的干脆
,把对你的思念放在歌中
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样做让我心碎
,答应我你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样会让我心碎

,快躺到床上让我疼你好吗
,我绝不会像那些人渣
,糟蹋你的傻
,烦恼就全部丢掉
,或许有的时候有点无聊
,打个电话问候她在尬聊
,想要和她说很多话
,但说不出口怕太难堪
,然后挂掉电话道声晚安
,或许好几年后还是不敢
,不敢对你说声 loveyou
,这句话 我真憋了很久
,怕被忽略 怕自己会难受
,就这样安安静静
,伴着你每个朝夕
,或许是命中注定
,我要吻遍你的全身上下
,从头到脚我都要
,大口的把你吃掉
,谁叫你那么可爱
,又那么可口
,我看到你就完全投降
,我爱看你穿着黑色丝袜
,脱高跟鞋的刹那
,超犯规超级性感
,快躺到床上让我疼你好吗
,我绝不会像那些人渣
,糟蹋你的傻

,干嘛听苦情歌以为多浪漫
,再浪漫都被拆散
,说要平平淡淡
,长路漫漫一起再共患难
,
,高脚杯 在陪伴
,以为决定 多果断
,在青春 快过半的阶段
,失去了对爱的基本判断
,问我什么是爱
,是初亚当和夏娃 开心咬下苹果
,问我谁在抵赖
,是时间是金钱是你解不开的屏锁
,这场战役都没赢过
,航行中你无法停泊
,争吵从未停过
,但是彼此内心
,在不停祈求停火
,每个起因都有经过
,今后剧情是堂新课
,倔强的看不清回忆那曾经
,一分开就怪给星座
,失落的自己总责怪自己
,在黑夜中怒吼
,如果我是你会说我爱你
,在左转的路口
,说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
,
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,
,就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
,我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
,
,怎么一不小心太疯狂
,
,用哪种方式纪念
,算最好的祭奠
,还会想跟你见面
,虽然只剩这张照片
,有开端就有结尾
,也许是一个机会
,在这匆匆流逝的岁月中
,你是记忆劫匪
,
,我想说声感谢
,毕竟你是最美好的节目
,多少次哽咽
,你的温柔我还一直记得住
,没有所谓对与错
,直到今天走到这一步
,所有怀疑都陨落
,当回头看走的这一路
,曾经爱过你恨过你
,想过你厌过你骗过你
,不停讲道理找刺激
,搞猫腻深陷这漩涡里
,现在 陪你迎风跑
,谁是你的避风岛
,如果不能问声好
,就让我来做你至尊宝
,说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
,
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,
,就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
,我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
,
,怎么一不小心太疯狂
,
,别后悔 就算错过
,
,在以后 你少不免想起我
,
,还算不错
,
,当我不在你会不会难过
,
,你够不够我这样洒脱
,
,说不上爱别说谎
,深夜的徘徊是思念在捣乱
,就一点喜欢
,
,谁先放手谁又将给谁好看
,说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
,烛光的对视变一个人的早餐
,将一切都体谅 将一切都原谅
,酒后的你又在对谁在期盼
,我尝试找答案 而答案很简单
,跳出爱的苦与疯
,很痛也必须放你走
,简单得很遗憾 因为成长
,我明白谁都有苦衷
,毕竟我牵过你的手
,我们逼不得已要习惯
,长大的过程中会有雷雨暴风
,
,那就珍惜每一秒每当你在我怀中
,因为成长 我们忽尔间说散就散
,
,在我十五岁的时候我也一样天天逃课
,那最堕落的生活我也都全部经历过
,我也一样讨厌父亲他们全都不懂我
,我的母亲红着双眼她说叫我别闯祸
,我被高年级的欺负 也一心想要报复
,有谁欺负过我 我都全部记得住
,我对他说我们年轻 以后的路还很长
,我要让他死在某天我们放学的路上
,后来呢 我们谁都没有死
,谁都没有死都还是过着堕落的日子
,我的班主任说我最适合退学回到家
,把浪费的学费都用来开一家网吧
,我看见我妈哭了 她哭得非常伤心
,我却不为所动 反正我什么都不听
,我告诉班主任我说你有事冲我来
,他说他没有办法 他也不能给我想要的未来
,那年你说你就是一团火
,那年你说没人懂你的寂寞
,那梦想越走越远
,所有叛逆都是在浪费时间
,离开学校的时候我跳着欢快的舞步
,英语老师不懂什么叫做What’s real life
,最碉堡的球鞋搭配要要切克闹
,最喜欢睡懒觉我他妈最讨厌学校
,就这样我从十五岁一直混到十七岁
,最喜欢黑社会最讨厌罗嗦的长辈
,我觉得全世界的老师全部都该死
,全世界的教务主任他们全部都是大骗子
,但是突然有天我的世界变了
,最疼爱我的外婆她竟然生病了
,她说最遗憾的事情就是我还没长大
,把我丢下她的心里和我一样害怕
,我磕了三个响头我说外婆你别怕
,我以后会听话 你安心的走吧
,我对不起他 他是我妈的妈
,她把我养大 她就这样走啦
,当我再次回到教室 再次拿起数学书
,我答应自己以后读书一定要挺住
,我需要一个梦想 我需要忘掉过往
,我忘掉了过往 还忘掉了中国的互联网
,我不是好孩子 也不是什么天才
,但那就是我第一次考虑自己的将来
,从不相信祈祷会为我带来多少好运
,我只想拿出态度让天堂的外婆高兴
,黑 GUYs梦想 离你并不远
,年少轻狂的我们都喜欢去冒险
,等到了懂事那一天才发现梦想已不再新鲜
,才发现浪费了太多的时间
,会认真对待今天
,最自信的语气叫做I can Ibelive
,最沸腾的语言叫做我们一起努力
,只有最怂的loser才会对你说兄弟讲义气
,最厉害的Rappers都说DJ Drop the beat
,光阴似箭 光阴快如闪电
,希望你拒绝早恋 不要再自我催眠
,以后能够起得早点 为家人做个早点
,保持笑脸才能够越走越远

,目的之一却不只是偷心
,想对你好照顾你
,不想从你的身体中抽离 想把你吃进胃里
,成为我的身体 一部分
,昨晚又梦见你 是路人
,挽留的姿势超过3秒就会觉得累

,But这次玩大了
,不是我神经大条
,忘了买保险
,剧情都被你给导演
,我也是有点怕了
,所以才选择走远
,
,我害怕找不到答案
,其实不想对你责难
,我不愿看你为难
,不想结局变得难堪
,我告诫自己 这是青春期最后一次的爱情
,根本没有期待 童话故事会在我的身上降临

,但你知道我只会 跟你回家
,我根本不需要你给我回答

,
,感谢你 给了我写这首歌的灵感
,发现我 原来也不是没有情感
,是因为 太在乎了所以才那么敏感
,我害怕 我们会摧毁所有的好感
,
,放心吧我不会公开我们的聊天记录
,你的喜好 我都有在小心翼翼地记录
,就算是眼泪 也当做过程去计入
,你身上痣的位置 其实我都有记住
,我从来 都不擅长意去会幸福
,你对我 的影响 就像是病毒
,癌症晚 期了我也不觉得辛苦
,学不会 洒脱至少我可以装酷
,
,坏  坏   的你从不会为谁停候
,fine fine反正习惯身后什么都没有
,尽管走 多远 我都可以承受
,今晚后 希望 你睡着时不会颤抖（握不到你的手）
,
,和别人的对话从第三句就终止
,开始理解有人会想用酒精去终止
,我冒昧地点开游戏却无法按中止
,你霸占了我心里竟然觉得有点充实
,
,清醒着说醉话 因为醉了只想抱你
,对别人高冷 对你花痴到你想报警
,其实很多话想对你说我开始避开重点
,出场顺序错误的剧情我不想再重演

,这座冰冷城市钢筋混凝土的弧线
,寒暄客套八面玲珑玩转的多么熟练
,脑中浮现的未来眨眼嘀嗒变空白
,抬头低头的周遭笼罩着漆黑的雾霾
,漂泊华夏甚至关内外 生活节奏日益的加速快
,不停的奔跑四处的寻找 港湾人生的下一站
,你为了梦追 做好充分的准备
,你不曾体会 岁月流逝的弥足珍贵
,离开的时候你有着青涩的脸
,漂泊的岁月把心脏都磨出了茧
,日复一日不堪的疲惫 你没有的选
,眼神日益深邃 纯粹的心依旧无谓
,祈祷 祷告 期待明天的拥抱
,无奈的扬起嘴角 微笑 这种感觉多么的微妙
,收拾好我的行囊 包裹 义无反顾背井离乡
,就算起伏或跌宕 也能听见远方悦耳的铃铛
,别犹豫了 别挣扎了
,陌生天空无意下起 倾盆大雨
,别犹豫了 别在意了
,你的狼狈不堪根本 没人提起
,别犹豫了 别挣扎了
,回到家乡回到记忆中的光阴
,别犹豫了 别在意了
,根本没人在意你的表情
,Come Back Come Back We Got Come Back
,谁是你的心跳
,Come Back Come Back We Got Come Back
,谁是你的骄傲
,Come Back Come Back We Got Come Back

,紧紧把我绑在你的房里
,紧紧把我抓在你的手心
,紧紧把我锁在你的怀里
,别放我走 别放我走 别放我走
,空气弥漫情动香味 我们突然视线交汇
,自我保护的驱壳 被你的温柔瞬间敲碎
,手把手所有都想被你教会
,学费打七折 但课程绝对不要只标配
,我大概到你胸口的高度
,一抬头就能看到你挑逗的招数
,脚步很轻松 微动的指尖
,我对你这么熟悉 才相识几天
,你是我吃过最好吃的糖 从包装到夹心
,像掺有兴奋剂 我感觉头重脚轻
,这一秒当我无辜 望向你 有没有心动
,温度几度 心跳怎么可能有计数
,我扑向你的时候不知轻重
,你笑着 说从此我的一切要向你倾诉
,我答了我愿意 yes i do 你眼神的爱意 is it true

,已破的谜底 我们就负责幸福就好
,我简单教学你要认真听

,捧着一颗少女心 变了法的低调对你示好
,被你一眼识破但不拆穿
,这是个小游戏 但分数跟你从来不明算
,惩罚也变得有趣 生活也变得有序
,你的名字你的样子 都像是长在我的细胞里
,它们融合成一体
,没想过的交集 你是我的惊喜
,仅仅是紧紧 仅仅是紧紧
,紧紧把我绑在你的房里
,紧紧把我抓在你的手心

,副歌：
,my worlds torn apart aint nobody know
,my walls are crumbling down, now im letting go
,im stripped naked to the core alone left in the cold
,im losin my grip and this feelin its killin me needin that somethin to hold
,now that the tables have turned you winnin so
,you went and sold your soul to the devil now i know
,my heart is achin and im faintin while you put on a show
,now with those lies im losin my mind
,verse1 Trouble.z：
,每一次转身都是为了期待下个遇见
,而我走走停停身边依然没有一个人
,错综复杂路口我不敢再做出任何选择
,直到打开那扇孤独者的门
,在我旁边有扇窗能看见霓虹灯的世界
,一堵墙却隔开心与心的距离
,我尽量保持面对那些流言视而不见
,把时间放在1739其他懒得去理
,oh my body 千疮百孔 只有经历过了才懂
,世界末日之前每个人的死法有一百种
,我挣脱开了蚕蛹 飞千里之外太空
,留下的伙伴只能慢慢放大他们瞳孔
,我从不轻易放弃哪怕根本得不到
,像个soldier在最后点燃这一炮
,攥在我手心里证明你有多重要
,就算是块玻璃 也别劝我丢掉
,流的是血 留着续写 不要拒绝
,我用生命为你低头去演
,画个地点 属于我的底线
,可以离开但是记得关门时轻一点
,我和homie会一直持续走起dope
,直到让整个南京城都点起头
,每个爱我的人都不需要理由
,每个恨我骂我笑我那就看好你的妞
,yeah mom 我曾答应你
,那些狐朋狗友距离保持八英里
,能够留下来的都是我的亲兄弟
,看谁不爽那就写首歌说谢谢你
,为了成长扒了几层外套
,开始变得像个xx学会倚门卖笑
,这是我的生活也是你的预告
,总有一天我会在你面前画上句号
,my worlds torn apart aint nobody know
,my walls are crumbling down, now im letting go

,verse2 法老：
,换了帽子 再换了鞋子
,再翻着你的样子 该算了
,别再次 争吵在门口巷子
,你把衣服塞进裤子让我滚出你的房子
,向我砸来杯子
,这辈子 你说白认识我这个兄弟
,那时我也明白已到说不通道理的田地
,那天气阴的
,天空是青的
,冷空气把我的脑海给愤怒到冰了
,尽管你还闭着眼睛但你给我听着
,你给我想想你小时候的景色
,我在便利店里想着心事
,我们从小就会争执烂透的真实或虚假的城市
,直到见到你 x君子的样子
,你在那些酒吧做着反社会的猫腻
,你觉得坐牢很帅吗需要拿出来炫耀吗
,该有粉丝为你TM的尖叫吗
,你的假朋友在背后对你耻笑着
,而我却拿出了拳头把他们给赶走
,有次你在我的演出现场厕所里面颤抖
,手握着可**活像一只落水狗
,如果这叫Hiphop
,那我宁可没有认识过
,我永远记得这个世界有多冷漠
,我们曾合租在四平米的公寓“江南摩尔”
,只因为你的梦想我还在苟延残喘
,那时你告诉我该如何写歌
,如今你却躺在病床这算什么大哥
,自暴自弃在浴缸用刀往手腕割
,就因为你的x子女友吃diao吃到打嗝
,我TM的想要揍扁你这傻逼脑壳
,现在我就打车去你家里把你那堆破铜烂铁打烂
,你根本不算rapper不配用麦
,你只是我的兄弟我要继续为你而战
,my worlds torn apart aint nobody know

,Love me, take me to outer space
,Kiss me, we're on fire, babe

,Kiss me, we're on fire, babe
,Love me, take me to outer space
,Kiss me, we're on fire...

  Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
 Launch your assault now, take it easy
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
 One word and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart
 Rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
 Always number one
 The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
 Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
 Dropping your bombs now
 On all we've built
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart, rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy
 Launch your assault now, take it easy
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
 One word and it's over
 Rippin' through like a missile
 Rippin' through my heart
 Rob me of this love
 Raise your weapon, raise your weapon and it's over
 Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
 Always number one
 The pen with a bent wrist crooked king
 Sign away our peace for your war, one word and it's over
 Dropping your bombs now
 On all we've built
 How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
 Raise your weapons, raise your weapons and it's over

,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine

,I know that it’s mine
,I know that it’s mine ~~~

,Is your heart racing
,Is that fire in your veins
,Are your bones burning

,We're all standing with our backs against the wall,
,Sooner or later
,Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
,Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm,
,Sooner or later
,Trying to swim but you're sinking like a stone, alone
,And I can feel fire in the night
,Waiting here
,Baby it's like we're
,Walking on a wire thru the fear
,Take my hand
,We'll get there
,Sooner or later
,I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it,
,Sooner or later
,I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it
,Milk and honey till we get our fill
,I'll keep chasing it, I always will
,Sooner or later
,I swear we'll make it there
,Sooner than later
,Sooner or later
,Sooner than later
,Sooner or later
,We're all waiting on a dream that's hard to own,
,Sooner or later
,Trying to feel the high without the low, you know
,And I can feel fire in the night
,Lying here
,Baby it's like we're
,Walking on a wire thru the fear
,Take my hand
,We'll get there
,Sooner or later
,I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it,
,Sooner or later
,I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it
,Milk and honey till we get our fill
,I'll keep chasing it, I always will
,Sooner or later
,I swear we'll make it there
,Sooner than later
,Sooner or later
,The fear inside
,The hills we've climbed
,The tears this side of heaven
,All these dreams inside of me
,I swear we're gonna get there
,Sooner or later
,We're gonna make it
,Sooner or later
,I know, I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it,

,I wish somebody would have told me that
,Some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of these good old days
,I was thinking about the band
,I was thinking about the fans
,We were underground
,Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
,In a small club in Minnesota
,And the snow outside of 1st Ave
,I just wanted my name in a star
,Now look at where we at
,Still growing up
,Still growing up
,I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
,Couldn't wait to get older
,Couldn't wait to be someone
,Now that I'm here
,Wishing I was still young
,Those good old days
,I wish somebody would have told me that
,That some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of the good old days
,Wish I didn't think I had the answers
,Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first
,Wish I made it to homecoming
,Got up the courage to ask her
,Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
,Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
,Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
,And felt comfortable in myself
,Rooftop open
,And the stars above
,Moment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love
,Me, you and that futon
,We'd just begun
,On the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was
,Those good old days
,I wish somebody would have told me that
,That some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of the good old days
,Never thought we'd get old
,Maybe we're still young
,May we always look back
,And think it was better than it was
,Maybe these are the moments
,Maybe I've been missing what it's about
,Been scared of the future
,Thinking about the past
,While missing out on now
,We've come so far
,I guess I'm proud
,And I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile
,I've got some scars
,I've been around
,I've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
,Those good old days
,You don't know
,What you've got
,Till it goes
,Till it's gone
,You don't know
,What you've got
,Till it goes
,Till it's gone
,I wish somebody would have told me that
,Some day, these will be the good old days
,All the love you won't forget
,And all these reckless nights you won't regret
,Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
,You'll miss the magic of these good old days

,
,You ready? Let's go!
,
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all (c'mon!)
,This is ten percent luck
,Twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure
,Fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
,Mike<Mike>
,He doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck em'
,He knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,It's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story
,Makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up(Let's go!)
,
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps
,Put it together himself, now the picture connects
,Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist
,
,This is twenty percent skill
,Eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
,And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method,Name Of The Game
,Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
,I like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!
,
,This is ten percent luck
,Twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure
,Fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
,
,They call him Ryu, he’s sick
,And he’s spittin fire with Mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,What a fuckin’ nihilist porcupine
,He's a prick, he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,And rappers hope he get shot
,Eight years in the makin'
,Patiently waitin to blow
,Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
,
,Tak
,He's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,He often gets a comment on his name
,People keep askin him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof
,Got him rockin' the booth

,It’s like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?

,I'm not afraid to take a stand
,Everybody come take my hand I guess
,We'll walk this road together, through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just let you know that, you're not alone
,Hola if you feel that you've been down the same road
,You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
,But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
,Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
,When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
,What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
,Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
,I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
,And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
,No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
,From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and
,Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
,Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
,Whichever comes first, for better or worse
,He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
,His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
,To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe
,
,I'm not afraid to take a stand
,Everybody come take my hand
,We'll walk this road together, through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just let you know that, you're not alone
,Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
,Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
,I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
,You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
,For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
,And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
,I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
,Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh
,Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
,Relax, I ain't going back to that now
,All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
,Cause I ain't playin' around
,There's a game called circle and I don't know how
,I'm way too up to back down
,But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
,Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
,This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
,But it's time to exercise these demons
,These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
,I'm not afraid to take a stand
,Everybody come take my hand
,We'll walk this road together, through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just let you know that, you're not alone
,Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
,
,And I just can't keep living this way
,So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
,I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
,I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
,I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
,Time to put my life back together right now
,
,It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
,Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
,So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
,And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
,I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
,I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
,My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
,No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
,To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
,You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
,Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
,Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
,Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
,But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and
,I'm not afraid to take a stand
,Everybody come take my hand
,We'll walk this road together, through the storm
,Whatever weather, cold or warm
,Just let you know that, you're not alone
,Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

,Little by little by little by little I’m going crazy X2
,In reality I’m just an average Joe with a simple life
,No American idol but I get by
,Wish I could tour a fifth wheel bus back to the real world
,Time to wake up and smell the anti freeze the land where big brother is bad to me
,I’ve got a blind date with destiny
,I’m Mexican, what an amazing race I get to be
,Most days are wickedly perfect
,Making me nervous, I’m a survivor
,The last on the planet deserted
,Pass the word like a ten thousand dollar pyramid scheme
,Changing the face of the game like a sport medical team
,I lead troopers a league of supreme boozers
,Press your luck with Sleep, go home the biggest loser
,I’ll have the last laugh like the last comic standing
,Making the band play as you walk off stage empty handed
,And I’m taking home America’s next top model
,Back to the bachelor pad, show her some longfellow
,Little by little by little by little I’m going crazy X4
,Little by little grow a little more bitter
,Sit down in my chair like a grown man sitting down to dinner
,Where’s my newspaper, boy? Dog, fetch me my slippers
,Feed me, do the dishes, if you need me I’m in the shitter
,With everybody so emo everyone expects emotion
,While I’m holding onto longterm solution for that notion
,That everything must go, must be shown off, be banned
,Be thrown into the lions as if the crowd cared
,Some are born like us, more important like them
,Some’ll live to the fullest, some’ll die in the system
,Just trying to live the ?
,So where’s my welfare? Where’s my healthcare?
,Where’s my sandwich? There’s my sandwich
,So, spin doctors spinning, old white men grinning? end to its bidding
,Can you think of a single thing that you’ve done
,That’s meant anything at all?
,I know I’ll gladly take the fall
,I was going in circles till I hit the wall
,I’m absolutely sure one day I’ll settle down
,Find a special spot, pascal and some mes tabs
,Got trees growing, got a flower garden going
,Couple herbs for the cooking, couple more for the smoking
,Got a hammock for the swing and fresh tomatoes for the salad
,That’ll compliment the burgers straight cookin on the grill
,Still I drink myself stupid, can’t walk home alone
,Need a shoulder to lean on, i need a cold beer
,It’s my meal ticket, if I could keep living on beer to get
,No ace in the hole and the weight of the game
,Is breaking your soul, keep changing the game
,Keep playing the role Keep selling my family short like Tolken readers
,Let it linger, hard to pick up teeth with broken fingers
,And I humbled myself till I was hollow inside
,But no more I’ll get the zipper you can swallow my pride
,Little by little by little by littleI’m going crazy
,Take a look at me now

,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,Wasn't ready to be a millionaire, I was ill-prepared
,I was prepared to be ill, though, the skill was there
,In the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
,It was 'bout bustin' raps and standin' for somethin'
,Fuck an acronym
,Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
,With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
,It ain't over 'til I say it's over - enough when I say enough
,Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up up
,I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
,When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it
,Raise your hands up like it's 12 noon
,Nah, homie, hold them bitches straight up
,Wait until you dislocate a rotator cuff
,Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
,Nah, egos, I ain't deflatin' 'em
,Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
,I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
,And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
,To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
,They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
,I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter
,I can adjust, plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
,So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
,Top 5 in this motherfucker and if I don't make the cut
,What, like I give a fuck
,I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
,To the side of a pump
,0 to 60 hop in and gun it
,Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin' 'em up
,And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
,And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
,Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bounce
,Stabbing myself with a fucking knife in the gut
,While I'm whiping my butt
,Cause I just shitted on the mic and like getting cut
,I get excited at the sight of my blood, you better fight with a nut
,Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
,Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier
,Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far
,Picture me quitting, now draw a circle and put a line through it, slut
,It's survival of what?
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all
,So get your ideas, stack your ammo
,But don't come unless you come to battle, jump in the saddle
,This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
,Lift, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
,Refuse to quit, the fuse is lit, can't diffuse the wick
,If I don't do this music shit I lose my shit
,Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
,It's all I know how to do
,As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
,But my respect is overdue
,I'm showin' you the flow no one used
,I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
,So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other traits
,So you'd better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
,Cause you'll never take my pride from me
,It’ll have to be pried from me
,So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
,But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
,Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
,And if you don't like me then fuck you!
,Self esteem must be fuckin' shooting through the roof
,Cause trust me
,My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
,I can see why the fuck I disgust you!
,I must be allergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze
,I just go atchoo then achieve!
,This is survival of the fittest
,This is do or die
,This is the winner takes it all
,So take it all

,Let it burn
,One love one game one desire
,One flame one bonfire let it burn higher
,I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
,Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
,It's david and goliath I made it to the eye of
,The storm feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
,Before my time start to wind down like the mayans
,I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
,It sounds like a riot on hush it's so quiet
,The only thing I hear is my heart I'm inspired
,By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
,Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
,You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
,That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
,You came to celebrate I came to cerebrate
,I hate losing I refuse to make the same mistake
,Ohhhh the fire the fire
,
,Ohhhh the fire the fire
,
,Ohhhh the fire inside you
,
,Let it burn
,You don't say good luck
,You say don't give up
,It's the fire inside you
,
,Let it burn
,
,The fire inside you
,
,The fire inside you
,
,The fire inside you
,
,
,
,
,Just a young gun with a quick fuse
,I was uptight, wanna let loose
,I was dreaming of bigger things
,And wanna leave my own life behind
,Not a yes sir, not a follower
,Fit the box, fit the mold
,Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
,I was lightning before the thunder
,Thunder, thunder
,Thunder, thun-, thunder
,Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
,Thunder, thun-, thunder
,Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
,Thunder, feel the thunder
,Lightning and the thunder
,Thunder, feel the thunder
,Lightning and the thunder
,Thunder, thunder
,Thunder
,Kids were laughing in my classes
,While I was scheming for the masses
,Who do you think you are?
,Dreaming 'bout being a big star
,You say you're basic, you say you're easy
,You're always riding in the back seat
,Now I'm smiling from the stage while
,You were clapping in the nose bleeds
,Thunder, thunder
,Thunder, thun-, thunder
,Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
,Thunder, thun-, thunder
,Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
,Thunder, feel the thunder
,Lightning and the thunder

,对这个世界如果你有太多的抱怨
,跌倒了就不敢继续往前走
,为什麽人要这麽的脆弱 堕落
,请你打开电视看看
,多少人为生命在努力勇敢的走下去
,我们是不是该知足
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡
,随着稻香河流继续奔跑
,微微笑 小时候的梦我知道
,不要哭让萤火虫带着你逃跑
,乡间的歌谣永远的依靠
,回家吧 回到最初的美好
,不要这麽容易就想放弃 就像我说的
,追不到的梦想 换个梦不就得了
,为自己的人生鲜艳上色 先把爱涂上喜欢的颜色
,笑一个吧 功成名就不是目的
,让自己快乐快乐这才叫做意义
,童年的纸飞机 现在终於飞回我手里
,所谓的那快乐 赤脚在田里追蜻蜓追到累了
,偷摘水果被蜜蜂给叮到怕了 谁在偷笑呢
,我靠着稻草人吹着风唱着歌睡着了
,哦 哦 午后吉它在虫鸣中更清脆
,哦 哦 阳光洒在路上就不怕心碎
,珍惜一切 就算没有拥有
,还记得你说家是唯一的城堡
,随着稻香河流继续奔跑

,On my whole world now
,Pouring over everything
,That we know
,A little bit of soul
,In the bottle that I drink down
,Fucked up
,Singing to the Heavens above
,Kissing the bricks of the home I was born in
,Stars all full of song
,Go

,The sun shines down
,On my whole world now
,Pouring over everything
,That we know

,Who can say where the road goes'
,Where the day flows
,Only time...
,And who can say if your love grows'
,As your heart chose
,Only time...
,Who can say why your heart sighs'
,As your love flies
,Only time...
,And who can say why your heart cries'
,When your love dies
,Only time...
,Who can say when the roads meet'
,That love might be'
,In your heart.
,And who can say when the day sleeps'
,If the night keeps all your heart
,Night keeps all your heart...
,Who can say if your love grows'
,As your heart chose
,Only time...
,And who can say where the road goes'
,Where the day flows
,Only time...Who knows
,Only time...Who knows

,I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
,Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
,staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
,I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
,Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
,Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
,You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
,Running into the dark underground
,All the subways around create a great sound
,To my motion fatigue: farewell
,With your ear to a seashell
,You can hear the waves in underwater caves
,As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
,
,Time together is just never quite enough
,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
,We need time, only time
,When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
,If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
,So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
,All the time, all the time
,Can you believe that the crew has gone
,and wouldn't let me sign on?
,All my islands have sunk in the deep,
,so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
,I feel as if I were home some nights
,when we count all the ship lights
,I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
,We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
,~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~
,Time together is just never quite enough

,I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
,Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
,And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
,And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
,I never did cry, and even though I had
,pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
,They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
,The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
,I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
,I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
,Never did like the police, let the whole world know
,Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
,And facin me now, what do I do?
,These thangs that a Thug goes through
,And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
,It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
,To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
,Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
,Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
,The back of the club, sippin Moet, is where you'll find me
,The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
,Mad question askin, blunt passin, music blastin

,Jump in the Rover and come over
,tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree
,Never a good day, cause in my hood they
,let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
,And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
,Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
,My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
,These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
,And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
,I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
,I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
,Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
,Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
,Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
,Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
,I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
,I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
,You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all

,【奇然】
,浔阳江头夜送客， 枫叶荻花秋瑟瑟。
,主人下马客在船， 举酒欲饮无管弦。
,醉不成欢惨将别， 别时茫茫江浸月。
,忽闻水上琵琶声， 主人忘归客不发。
,寻声暗问弹者谁？ 琵琶声停欲语迟。
,【沈谧仁】
,移船相近邀相见， 添酒回灯重开宴。
,千呼万唤始出来， 犹抱琵琶半遮面。
,转轴拨弦三两声， 未成曲调先有情。
,弦弦掩抑声声思， 似诉平生不得志。
,低眉信手续续弹， 说尽心中无限事。
,轻拢慢捻抹复挑， 初为霓裳后六幺。
,【奇然】
,大弦嘈嘈如急雨， 小弦切切如私语。
,嘈嘈切切错杂弹， 大珠小珠落玉盘。
,【沈谧仁】
,间关莺语花底滑， 幽咽泉流冰下难。
,冰泉冷涩弦凝绝， 凝绝不通声暂歇。
,别有幽愁暗恨生， 此时无声胜有声。
,银瓶乍破水浆迸， 铁骑突出刀枪鸣。
,曲终收拨当心画， 四弦一声如裂帛。
,东船西舫悄无言， 唯见江心秋月白。
,（念白）
,沉吟放拨插弦中， 整顿衣裳起敛容。
,自言本是京城女， 家在虾蟆陵下住。
,十三学得琵琶成， 名属教坊第一部。
,曲罢曾教善才服， 妆成每被秋娘妒。
,【奇然】
,五陵年少争缠头， 一曲红绡不知数。
,钿头银篦击节碎， 血色罗裙翻酒污。
,【沈谧仁】
,今年欢笑复明年， 秋月春风等闲度。
,弟走从军阿姨死， 暮去朝来颜色故。
,【奇然】
,门前冷落鞍马稀， 老大嫁作商人妇。
,商人重利轻别离， 前月浮梁买茶去。
,【合】
,去来江口守空船， 绕船月明江水寒。
,夜深忽梦少年事， 梦啼妆泪红阑干。
,【奇然】
,我闻琵琶已叹息， 又闻此语重唧唧。
,同是天涯沦落人， 相逢何必曾相识！
,我从去年辞帝京， 谪居卧病浔阳城。
,浔阳地僻无音乐， 终岁不闻丝竹声。
,住近湓江地低湿， 黄芦苦竹绕宅生。
,其间旦暮闻何物？ 杜鹃啼血猿哀鸣。
,【沈谧仁】
,春江花朝秋月夜， 往往取酒还独倾。
,岂无山歌与村笛？ 呕哑嘲哳难为听。
,今夜闻君琵琶语， 如听仙乐耳暂明。
,【合】
,莫辞更坐弹一曲， 为君翻作《琵琶行》。
,感我此言良久立， 却坐促弦弦转急。
,凄凄不似向前声， 满座重闻皆掩泣。
,座中泣下谁最多？ 江州司马青衫湿。
,【奇然】
,江州司马青衫湿。

やっと眼を覚ましたかい それなのになぜ眼も合わせやしないんだい？
终于醒来了吗 为何不与我对视呢？
「遅いよ」と怒る君 これでもやれるだけ飛ばしてきたんだよ
你生气的责备我“来的太迟啦” 可这已经是我耗尽全力飞来你身边的速度了
心が身体を追い越してきたんだよ
我的心甚至蹦出了身体 早早地来到了这儿
君の髪や瞳だけで胸が痛いよ
仅仅是看着你的发梢和眼眸胸口就隐隐作痛
同じ時を吸いこんで離したくないよ
想要和你生活在同一个时空 再也不要分开
遥か昔から知る その声に
听见那个从遥远过去就烂熟于心的声音
生まれてはじめて 何を言えばいい？
有生以来的第一次 我该回应些什么呢
君の前前前世から僕は 君を探しはじめたよ
从你的前前前世开始 我就在寻找着你
そのぶきっちょな笑い方をめがけて やってきたんだよ
追逐着你笨拙的笑容 总算抵达至今
君が全然全部なくなって チリヂリになったって
就算你消失不见 散落成一片一片
もう迷わない また１から探しはじめるさ
我也会又一次拼凑这些碎片 不会再迷茫哦
むしろ０から また宇宙をはじめてみようか
换句话说就如此从零开始制造一个宇宙看看吧
君の前前前世から僕は 君を探しはじめたよ
从你的前前前世开始 我就在寻找着你哦
そのぶきっちょな笑い方をめがけて やってきたんだよ

君が全然全部なくなって チリヂリになったって
就算你消失不见 散落成碎片
もう迷わない また１から探しはじめるさ
我也会又一次拼凑碎片 不会再迷茫哦
何光年でも この歌を口ずさみながら
不管要跨越多少光年 我都会哼着这首歌 再度找到你

,我嚼着最贵的晚餐
,可惜我无所谓应对这账单
,左右逢源不是个好习惯
,旁若无人要不要试试看
,好不容易脱下天价的衣衫
,不如说我卸下拖累的金砖
,是人是鬼一眼就看的穿
,不用非要学贵族的装扮
,太多废话都无关感情
,太多动作都始于环境
,就像青春期的小孩会被大人酷刑
,理由是 逼迫15岁的心灵
,比成人要理性
,那些道理我们从小就听
,长大后不得不听命运的命
,不是 道理多难履行
,而是现实它太任性
,多少人能看懂人心的空镜
,只不过活着活着只活出了年龄
,我攥着别人遥不可及的东西
,一边自嘲一边冷眼那些肮脏的事情
,如果真话
,搅局假话不如闭嘴来的清静
,鄙视那含蓄的交易
,都像强心针样的陷阱
,让人 无时无刻高速运转
,该怎么保持清醒
,趁你们还热爱浑水摸鱼的游戏
,一本正经
,披着羊皮创造你们的使命
,当真的傻子乐此不疲在消耗着热情
,装傻的戏子
,你可赚到了吐沫飞溅的缓刑
,怕被拆穿还没被拆穿
,本就是你要的刺激
,I'm boring 我只想一个人不说话
,I'm boring 我只想一个人不用笑
,我很想望着一闪一闪发光的星星
,像其他同学一样唱着亮晶晶
,可我的眼前炮满
,来自虚伪世界的轰鸣
,我还有很多事做很多歌听
,可我就想窝在沙发做些无聊的点评
,朋友
,在醉酒后咒骂世界不公平
,滑稽的排列组合让我想起了曾经
,那时候爸妈总算分开的场景
,和我高举成绩单强颜镇定的表情
,老爸你揣着银子
,到底是应酬还是旅行
,闹吧
,我总算找到适者生存的途径
,总有人说的好听做起来像个逃兵
,过河拆桥 真的好吗
,但凡是活着就得习惯
,这附带悬念的案情
,我大脑都是各种嘴脸在抢镜
,行吧
,我看够了自私的目的 生硬的交情
,我听够了善意的欺瞒 辩驳的矫情
,所谓的个性 并非教养的不明
,谁来解释下为什么好人卡那么流行
,得到它 等于判定了人性
,I'm boring 我只想一个人不说话
,I'm boring 我只想一个人不用笑
,我嚼着最贵的晚餐
,可惜我无所谓应对这账单
,左右逢源不是个好习惯
,旁若无人要不要试试看

,Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
,I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
,To cover on
,
,For every tyrant to tear upon the vulnerable
,In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
,For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
,With something to believe in
,
,Monday left me broken
,Tuesday I was through with hoping
,Wednesday my empty arms were open
,Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
,Bang the stars it's Friday

, Du warst sternenklar
, Wolkenlos, doch unsichtbar
, Wie der Wind
, Ich hab' dich gehen lassen
, Nicht zurückgesehen
, Ich hab' geglaubt, irgendwie wird mir der Lauf der Zeit
, Meine Sehnsucht nehmen
, Doch ich warte, Stunden wurden Tage
, Und aus Wochen ein dunkles Jahr

, Ich hab' versucht, dich und alles zu vergessen
, Doch geschaft hab' ich es nicht
, Ich wollte in Gedanken so oft flüchten
, Doch vor der Warheit kann kann niemand flieh'n
,
, Und es fühlt sich an wie ein Heimweh
, Denn ohne dich find' ich nicht mein'n Heimweg
, Ich hab' kein'n Kompass mehr
, Zurückzufinden fehlt mir so schwer

, Комнаты сужаются, становится всё делать лень.
, Бороду не брей, не пьяней, синька, сука, злей!

, В Лабе дуга перебита пунктиром. Мысли - водопад.
, Мы мечтаем о свободе, мы хотим тонуть в любви,
, Но нас тянут вниз грехи, там и тут стерегут они.
, Это life, а не байка, прибереги понты!
, Ведь тут сверкает у майка баламут фирменный.
, На бит нанизаны мной фразы - козырные тузы.
, Остановись, не бузи; фортуна, дай дух перевести.
, Мы с Леприконом базарим об этом,
, Эта киношка - бомба с острым сюжетом!
, Рам-бам-бам-бам. Я пою о том, о сём.
, Припухни рядом и давай сотрём
, В порошок хандру. Стиль перевернём!

, И кока-колла - вредная, утоляет жажду.
, Я залип, мой день тянись и меня следом за собой.
, Моя свобода, переверни житуху, бля, буду -
, Живой или мёртвый...
, Рэгги, пропагандируем добро.
, Рэгги, ни к чему война миров.
, И на готове звёзды,
, Птицы, небо, воздух и вода.
, Пора подытожить эти тёрки
, За бабло, печаль, беда.
, Наводим шороха в пороховницах наших,
, Во, бля, сколько пороха!
, Злого дебила давило,
, Мы на позитиве - здорово!
, Нас-то по части раста, какой есть, бля, принимай.
, Бошками качаем, ой-ёй-ёй, да, ай-яй-яй!
, Не Уокер, но крутой, районы качиво хотят!
, Раскачал ребят, но дяде не навалял под зад.
, Ты меня понял, если вероломный - ни шагу назад,
, Ни шагу назад, слышь, ни шагу назад!
, Взорвать, взорви, но только без паники!
, Грязи намути, но только без паники!
, Хочешь - паникуй, но только без паники,
, Без паники, только без паники!

,다시 너를 볼 수 있을까 다시
,스쳐 지나가 버린 운명 앞에 서 있어
,깨지 못할 꿈이었을까 우리
,멀어지는 너에게 전하지 못했어
,한번도
,널 사랑해
,내 깊은 마음속
,Don`t let me cry
,넌 닿으면 없어질 꿈
,녹아내려 버릴 눈
,네가 그리워질 때면
,난 너가 돼 있었고
,잡지 않았어 널 다시 올 줄 알고
,그리워하다 보면
,언젠가는 다시 볼 줄 알고
,열병 같던 감정의 시작 끝
,그 시작 끝에 서 있어
,비상등처럼 어둠 속
,혼자 우두커니 불 켜있어
,아무리 생각해도 답은 넌데
,가슴에 틀린 답을 적네
,밀어내도 남아있어
,어느새 꿈속에 와있어
,I don`t wanna lose you
,Be without you
,Anymore
,생각해도 모르겠어
,너 없이 사는 법

,딱 하루 돌아갈 수 있다면
,그 날로 나 살 수 있다면
,널 아프게 한 말과
,행동 되돌릴 수 있다면
,널 덜 외롭게 하고
,더 꽉 안을 수 있다면
,미치게 후회스러운 그 하루
,다시 내게 주어진다면
,다시는 내게서 네 손
,절대로 놓지 않을게 내가
,넌 예쁘게만 피면 돼
,널 위해서 가시가 될게 내가
,빌어먹을 왜 몰랐을까
,그때 널 잡았다면 달랐을까
,난 어차피 넌데
,널 떠나봤자 결국
,어차피 넌데
,I don`t wanna lose you
,Be without you
,Anymore

,People look at you like youse the user
,Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
,But they don't know about your stress-filled day
,Baby on the way mad bills to pay
,That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
,And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
,I remember I was just like you
,Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
,Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
,I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
,She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
,Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
,Packed up my tools for my raw power move
,Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
,For chumps tryin to stop my flow
,And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
,Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
,Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
,Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court

,Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
,Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
,Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
,Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
,Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
,My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
,Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
,If you believe then you can achieve
,Just look at me
,Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
,Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
