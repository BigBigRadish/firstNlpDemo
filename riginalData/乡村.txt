,盘铃声清脆 帷幕间灯火幽微
,我和你 最天生一对

,将谦卑 温柔成绝对

,流年匆忙 对错何妨
,你在尘世中辗转了千百年
,却只让我看你最后一眼
,火光描摹容颜燃尽了时间
,别留我一人 孑然一身
,凋零在梦境里面
,萤火虫愿将夏夜遗忘
,如果终究要挥别这段时光
,裙袂不经意沾了荷香
,从此坠入尘网
,屐齿轻踩着烛焰摇晃
,所有喧嚣沉默都描在画上
,从惊蛰一路走到霜降
,泪水凝成诗行

,难绘虚妄 难解惆怅
,梦境微凉 情节微凉
,迷离幻象 重叠忧伤
,原来诀别是因为深藏眷恋
,你用轮回换我枕边月圆
,我愿记忆停止在枯瘦指尖
,随繁花褪色 尘埃散落
,渐渐地渐渐搁浅
,多年之后 我又梦到那天
,画面遥远 恍惚细雨绵绵
,如果来生太远寄不到诺言
,不如学着放下许多执念
,以这断句残篇向岁月吊唁

,昨夜的谁躲进了梦  随着风
,追上那狂野的弧度  叠叠重
,岁月的愁剩酒一壶  醉了秋
,我还有唱不完的节奏  不休
,聆听你轻声的悠扬  小村庄
,旧事就洒月色荷塘  水中央
,还有两三王子嚷让  伴花香
,时光时光忆起旧模样  轻狂
,流水流过了几个趟  一座座桥梁
,我怀念这个老地方
,谁随着乡音哼着唱  你还是旧模样
,我却早已变了样

,远方火山喷涌
,我在等炉台上就要沸腾的汤
,有人被迫迁徙 夜里 相拥着哭泣
,时代会莫名的喊出个巨响
,而我在想着远山中每条河的去向 总是远的
,如果 这个世界 在明天一醒来崩掉
,在此刻 还是会做个美味的蛋糕
,让我睡得安心的恰好就是能被我拥抱的荒岛
,总是暖的
,我的小城很多雨
,午后的河道旁总是泛着波光
,远处孩子们裸着身体
,嬉闹着 奔向了河塘
,时代它每一刻涌出个狂想
,而我在想着跋涉中每张脸的异乡 总是冷的
,如果这个世界 在明天被厄运埋掉
,我依然 做诗句里的那一个符号
,给我能够栖息的 恰好就是能被我拥抱的荒岛
,总是暖的
,如果这个世界 在明天被厄运埋掉
,我依然 做诗句里的那一个符号

,没关系有小熊陪Cubi看月亮

,雨后有车驶来
,驶过暮色苍白
,旧铁皮往南开 恋人已不在
,收听浓烟下的 诗歌电台
,不动情的咳嗽 至少看起来
,归途也还可爱
,琴弦少了姿态
,再不见那夜里 听歌的小孩
,时光匆匆独白
,将颠沛磨成卡带
,已枯卷的情怀 踏碎成年代
,就老去吧 孤独别醒来
,你渴望的离开
,只是无处停摆
,就歌唱吧 眼睛眯起来
,而热泪的崩坏
,只是没抵达的存在
,青春又醉倒在
,籍籍无名的怀
,靠嬉笑来虚度 聚散得慷慨
,辗转却去不到 对的站台
,如果漂泊是成长 必经的路牌
,你迷醒岁月中
,那贫瘠的未来
,像遗憾季节里 未结果的爱
,弄脏了每一页诗
,吻最疼痛的告白
,而风声吹到这 已无需释怀
,就老去吧 孤独别醒来
,你渴望的离开
,只是无处停摆
,就歌唱吧 眼睛眯起来
,而热泪的崩坏
,只是没抵达的存在

,在夏天结束的瞬间怀念你年轻身影
,你每天都在说的那些话如今讲给谁人听
,当过往散了爱慕与光阴相向而行
,你眼神烙印岁月最后的深情
,也许一次离别就能抹去再多的重逢
,那年一起种下的树啊如今飘荡着一样的风
,当誓言终将欺了日月这爱恋不澈不浓
,你裙摆绽放走向我脚步轻松
,可是命运啊 渴望啊 和热烈啊
,非将这生长赋予悲欢交织的感动
,夏日轻柔的晚风 壮阔波澜的相拥
,已杂草丛生
,都不及你第一次望向我的面容

I remember when we ruled the scene
Back when we reigned supreme
Black words in golden speech
The weapons in our reach
Tell me did I stutter?
Did you hear me right?
As the crowd begins to roar
Tell me where’s the limit and I’ll tell you why
You will be shaken by the sound
‘Cos I’m gonna touch the sky
I’m damaging at my new discipline
I’m telling you
Can you smell the blood that’s in the air
It’s ours but we don’t care
Burning the resistance to the ground
In line to claim your crown
Tell me did I stutter?
Did you hear me right?
As the crowd begins to roar
Tell me where’s the limit and I’ll tell you why
You will be shaken by the sound
‘Cos I’m gonna touch the sky
I’m damaging at my new discipline
I’m telling you I’m gonna touch the sky
I’m falling out where I was falling in
I’m telling you I’m gonna touch the sky
If you’re gonna start a war
You better know the choice you made is one worth fighting for
You can have your ground
‘Cos when I touch the sky I’m taking everything you’ve got
Tell me did I stutter?
Did you hear me right?
As the crowd begins to roar
Tell me where’s the limit and I’ll tell you why
You will be shaken by the sound
‘Cos I’m gonna touch the sky
I’m damaging at my new discipline
I’m telling you I’m gonna touch the sky
I’m falling out where I was falling in
I’m telling you I’m gonna touch the sky

,I am not the kind of girl
,Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
,But you are not the kind of boy
,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
,
,I sneak in and see your friends'
,And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid'
,Somewhere back inside a room
,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
,This.. is.. surely not what you thought it would be
,I.. lose myself in a daydream
,Where I stand and say
,
,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,You need to hear me out and they said speak now
,
,Fun gestures are exchanged
,And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
,And I am hiding in the curtains
,It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
,She.. floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
,I.. know.. you wish it was me
,You wish it was me don't you?
,
,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,You need to hear me out and they said speak now
,
,Don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,Your time is running out and they said speak now
,
,
,I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
,There's the silence' there's my last chance
,I stand up with shaking hands' all eyes on me
,
,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
,But I'm only looking at you
,
,I am not the kind of girl
,Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
,But you are not the kind of boy
,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
,
,So don't say yes' run away now
,I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the backdoor
,Don't wait or say a single vow
,You need to hear me out and they said speak now
,And you say lets run away now
,I'll meet when I'm out of my tux at the backdoor
,Baby I didn't say my vows'
,So glad you were around
,When they said 'Speak now'

,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her,
,or anyone, or anything, yeah
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in

,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,When it went down
,It was so hard to breathe
,I gave up everything
,In the slow fall down to the floor
,Life was escaping me
,I couldn’t find myself
,Till it was all lost
,Not anymore
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time
,I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually
,I know it’s mine
,I found gold in the wreckage
,Put it on a necklace
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine
,I wear it like a message
,So I don’t forget it
,Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine

,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine
,I know that it's mine~~~
,Facing the change
,But it’s still tough to see
,At first I fought it all
,I was so mean
,I’m still unsure
,How it’s supposed to be
,But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth
,Until I learn
,I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris
,Till it’s time

,I lost myself in fear of losing you
,I wish I didn't do
,But I did
,I lost my own, my own identity
,Forgot that you picked me for me
,
,But now, I don't negotiate with the insecurities
,They always seem to get the best of me

,I’m five years old and it’s getting cold
,I’ve got a big coat on
,I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you
,I run and run
,Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
,Look now the sky is gold
,I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
,I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
,I know that you’re not scared of anything at all
,Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away
,But I know I had the best day
,With you today
,I’m thirteen now and don’t know how my friends could be so mean
,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
,And we talk and window shop till I forget their names
,I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school
,But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
,Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel ok
,But I know I had the best day with you today
,I have an excellent father
,His strength is making me stronger
,God smiles on my little brother
,Inside and out he’s better than I am
,I grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
,There is a video i found from back when i was three
,You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you’re talking to me
,It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
,Daddy’s smart and you’re the prettiest lad in the whole wide world
,Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
,I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
,And I love you for giving me your eyes
,Staying back and watching me shine
,and I didn’t know if you knew
,So I’m taking this chance to say
,that i had the best day with you today
, 作曲 : Taylor Swift
, 作词 : Taylor Swift
,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
,It's the morning of your very first day
,You say hi to your friends who ain't seen in a while
,Try and stay out of everybody's way
,It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
,For the next four years in this town
,Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
,You know I haven't seen you around, before
,'Cause when you're fifteen
,Somebody tells you they love you
,You're gonna believe them
,And when you're fifteen feeling like
,There's nothing to figure out, but
,Count to ten, take it in
,This is life before you know
,Who you're gonna be
,Fifteen
,
,You sit in a class next to a redhead Abigail
,And soon enough you're best friends
,Laughing at the others girls
,Who think they're so cool
,We'll be out of here as soon as we can
,And then you're on you're very first date
,And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
,And you're mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
,And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
,When the night ends
,'Cause when you're fifteen
,Somebody tells you they love you
,You're gonna believe them
,And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
,Makes you head spin 'round but
,In your life you'll do things greater
,Than dating the boy on the football team
,But I didn't know it at fifteen
,
,When all you wanted
,Was to be wanted
,Wish you could go back
,And tell yourself what you know now
,Back then I swore I was gonna
,Marry him someday
,But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
,Who changed his mind
,And we both cried
,'Cause when you're fifteen,
,Somebody tells you they love you
,You're gonna believe them
,And when you're fifteen,
,Don't forget to look before you fall
,I've found time can heal most anything
,And you just might find who you're supposed to be
,I didn't know who I was supposed to be
,At fifteen
,Lalalalalalala
,Your very first day
,Take a deep breath girl
,Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

, Losing all of me in a labyrinth of you
, There's nothing that you're smoking, your mirrors won't do
,
, Woah, woah
, It's like you only love one half of me
, When we fall I was straight on the phone
, But you can't even say my name when we're alone
,
, Take me places only where we're allowed
, You only love me when the lights go out
, I know that you tryna hide away
, But you find me dancing on my own parade
,
, So boom da deep down
, Show me that you love me
, Boom da deep down

, I know that you tryna hide away
, But I'll be dancin' on my own parade
,
, No rules in this love affair
, But when it's time to play you don't act like you care
, Said baby you're my only poor judges in me
, But it seem to be a blank page in your diary
,
, Oh, find me dancin' on my own
, Won't you find a way to show love

,And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
,The places you play and where you stay
,Looks like one great big alleyway
,You'll admire all the number-book takers
,Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
,Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
,And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
,Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
,Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
,You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
,But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
,Now you're unemployed, all non-void
,Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
,Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
,Got sent up for a eight-year bid
,Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
,Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
,Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
,'til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
,It was plain to see that your life was lost
,You was cold and your body swung back and forth
,But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
,Of how you lived so fast and died so young so...
,Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
,I'm trying not to lose my head
,Uh huh huh huh huh
,It's like a jungle sometimes
,It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
,Huh, uh huh huh huh huh

,So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
,You never been on a ride like this before

,It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
,D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see
,Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
,Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite

,(Hell yeah) so Dre (What's up Dogg?)
,Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
,We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
,And it's gotta be bumping, (City of Compton)
,Is where it takes place so, when asked, your attention
,Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
,Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
,When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
,Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
,My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
,Never let me slip, cause if I slip then I'm slipping
,But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
,And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
,And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
,Yeah and you don't stop
,I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
,But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
,C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
,Putting the shit together
,Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts
,I'm standing there
,On the balcony in summer air
,See the lights, see the party, the ballgowns
,See you make your way through the crowds and say hello (hello)
,Little did I know
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
,And my Daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet!'
,And I was crying on the staircase
,Begging you please don't go
,And I said,
,'Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.'
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlett letter
,And my Daddy said, 'Stay away from Juliet!'
,But you were everything to me
,I was begging you please don't go
,And I said,
,'Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
,Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
,This love is difficult, but it's real
,Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
,It's a love story, baby just say yes.'
,I got tired of waiting,
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of the town
,And I said,
,'Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
,I keep waiting for you but you've never come
,Is this in my head, I don't know what to think.'
,He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,
,'Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your Dad, you'll pick out a white dress
,It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,Baby, just say yes.
,‘Cause we were both young when I first saw you
,
,Midnight,
,You come and pick me up, no headlights
,Long drive,
,Could end in burning flames or paradise
,Fade into view, oh, it’s been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
,I should just tell you to leave ’cause I
,Know exactly where it leads but I
,Watch us go ’round and ’round each time
,You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
,‘Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
,And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
,And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
,‘Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style.
,So it goes
,He can’t keep his wild eyes on the road
,Takes me home
,Lights are off, he’s taking off his coat
,I say, “I heard, oh, that you’ve been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.”
,He says, “What you’ve heard is true but I
,Can’t stop thinking about you,” and I…
,I said, “I’ve been there too a few times.”
,You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
,‘Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
,And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
,And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
,‘Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,Come on
,Come on
,Let’s run wild baby the city is ours
,Counting stars kissing beneath meteor showers
,Never in my wildest dreams and fantasies
,Daydreaming about the two of us being Kings and Queens
,We’re a match made in heaven, a dynamic duo
,Anything but ordinary, we’re destine
,The future looking good, like we bought a personal stylist
,I’m a bandit and stag myself one incredible diamond
,We got something that would last forever love at its finest
,My one and only wonder woman
,Laced up your lasso to pull me in
,When I was chasing after the baddest girls
,Forgive my stubbornness
,Splatter paint on the canvas, what a beautiful mess
,Shouting no regrets and harmony like a perfect duet
,We’ll never go out of style, we’re too fresh
,You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
,‘Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,
,
,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
,And I'm a house of cards
,You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
,But I kinda know that I won't get far
,And you stood there in front of me just
,Close enough to touch
,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
,What I was thinking of
,Drop everything now
,Meet me in the pouring rain
,Kiss me on the sidewalk
,Take away the pain
,'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
,Get me with those green eyes, baby
,As the lights go down
,Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
,
,'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
,My mind forgets to remind me, that's your a bad idea
,You touch me once and it's really something
,You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
,But with you I know its no good
,And I could wait patiently
,But I really wish you would
,Drop everything now
,Meet me in the pouring rain
,Kiss me on the sidewalk
,Take away the pain
,'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
,I run my fingers through your hair
,And watch the lights go wild
,Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
,Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
,And lead me up the staircase
,Won't you whisper soft and slow
,And I'm captivated by you baby
,Like a fireworks show

,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
,Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly

,As the red fades from your wrinkled dress
,Picture all the people you've impressed

,Vision starts to crawl when I'm near
,And the evening waits
,When you get caught up to your own mistakes
,Made up of different lines
,I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind

,John - Julia Dear Sheer
,Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
,Counting my footsteps,
,Praying the floor won´t fall through, again
,
,My mother accused me of losing my mind
,But I swore I was fine
,You paint me a blue sky
,And go back and turn it to rain
,
,And I lived in your chess game,
,But you changed the rules every day
,
,Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone,
,
,Tonight
,
,Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
,
,Dear John,
,I see it all now that you´re gone
,Don´t you think I was too young to be messed with
,The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
,I should´ve known
,
,Well maybe it´s me and my blind optimism to blame
,
,Maybe it´s you and your sick need to give love then take it away
,
,And you´ll add my name to your long list of traitors who don´t understand
,And I´ll look back and regret how I ignored when they say "run as fast as you can"
,Dear John,
,I see it all, now it was wrong
,Don´t you think 19 is too young to be played by your dark twisted games, when I love you so?
,You are an expert at sorry,
,And keeping lines blurry
,Never impressed by my acing your tests
,All the girls that you run dry with tired, lifeless eyes
,Cause you burned them out
,But I took your matches before fire could catch me
,So don´t look now:
,shinning I´m like fireworks over your sad, empty town
,
,Dear John,
,
,See it all now that you´re gone
,Don´t you think I was too young to messed with
,The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
,Dear John,
,I see it all, now it was wrong
,Don´t you think 19 is too young to be played by your dark twisted games, when I love you so?
,shouldI ´ve known
,Is Better Two Than One - Julia Sheer
,I remember what you wore on the first day
,You came into my life and I thought
,"Hey, you know, this could be something"
,
,Cause everything you do and words you say
,know You that it all takes my breath away
,
,And now I´m left with nothing
,So maybe it´s true
,That I can´t live without you
,Maybe two is better than one
,There´s so much time
,To figure out the rest of my life
,And you´ve already got me coming undone
,
,And I´m thinking two is better than one
,
,I remember every look upon your face
,The way you roll your eyes
,The way you taste
,You make it hard for breathing
,Oh, cause when I close my eyes and drift away
,I think of you and everything´s okay
,I´m finally now believing
,That maybe it´s true
,That I can´t live without you
,Maybe two is better than one
,There´s so much time
,To figure out the rest of my life
,youAnd ´ve already got me coming undone
,And I´m thinking two is better than one
,
,One
,
,I remember what you wore on the first day
,You came into my life and I thought "hey"
,
,So maybe it´s true
,That I can´t live without you
,Maybe two is better than one
,There´s so much time
,To figure out the rest of my life
,you´And ve already got me coming undone
,So I´m thinking oh
,That I can´t live without you
,Maybe two is better than one
,There´s so much time
,To figure out the rest of my life
,But I´ll figure it out
,When all is said and done
,
,Two is better than one
,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her,
,or anyone, or anything, yeah
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

,I used to think that one day we'd tell the story of us,
,And how we met
,And how the sparks flew instantly
,And people would say they're the lucky ones
,I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
,Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
,Oh, a simple complication, Miscommunications lead to far love,
,So many things I wish that you knew
,So many walls that I can't break through
,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
,And you're not speaking
,And I'm dying to know
,Is it killing you Like it's killing me
,And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down
,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
,Next chapter
,How did we end up this way?
,See me nervously pulling of my clothes and trying to look busy
,And you're doing your best to avoid me
,I'm starting to think that one day I'll tell the story of us
,Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
,But you held your pride like you should have held me,
,Oh I'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing
,I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
,Ive never heard silence quite this loud.
,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
,And you're not speaking
,And I'm dying to know
,Is it killing you Like it's killing me
,And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down
,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
,The battle is your hand now
,But I would lay my armor down
,If you said you'd rather love then fight
,So many things that you wish I knew
,But the story of us might be ending soon
,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
,And you're not speaking
,And I'm dying to know
,Is it killing you Like it's killing me
,And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down
,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

,The drought was the very worst, ah, ahh
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,It was months and months of back and forth
,You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
,On my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turn black like a perfect storm
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,There was nothing left to do
,And the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
,So I punched a hole in the roof
,Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
,The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,I think I am finally clean
,Said, I think I am finally clean
,10 months sober, I must admit
,Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
,10 months older I won't give in
,Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
,The drought was the very worst
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
'Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of bands he doesn't like.
And he'll never know your story like I do.
He wears jerseys
I wear t-shirts
He's team captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me!
Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?"
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile since he brought you down
You say you're fine - I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a dick like that?
I wear Toms and
He wears sneakers
He's banging your friend
Underneath the bleachers
I'm dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me?
Standing by you waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me?
You belong with me
You belong with me
I walked through the door with you, 
和你一起穿过你家前门
The air was cold
总有凉爽的风吹来
But something about it felt like home somehow
这情景，就是家的感觉吧
And I left my scarf there, at your sister's house
那条围巾，我当时忘在你姐姐房间了
And you still got it in your drawer, even now.
现在你的抽屉里，还保存着
Oh, your sweet disposition
“你的房间太整洁了吧！”
And my wide-eyed gaze
我睁大双眼，惊叹到
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
我们开着车，唱着歌，消失在这个小地方的北边…
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
秋天的落叶，像微粒旋入空中
And I can picture it after all these days.
过了这么久，那画面还历历在目
And I know it's long gone and thatmagic's not here no more
我知道时光逝去太久，那微妙的魔力也早已不在了
And I might be okay, but I’m not fine atall... 
现在的我也许可以算“过得不错”，但真的没有“特别幸福”
'Cause there we are again on that little town street, 
我们终于重逢了，在这小地方的街道上
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me.
你远远地看着我，还差点闯了红灯
Wind in my hair, I was there
风在我发间，我在你面前
I remember it all too well.
清晰的画面
Photo album on the counter, 
我抽屉的影集里
Your cheeks were turning red
你双颊泛红
You used to be a little kid with glasses
你那时就是一个戴眼镜的小男生
In a twin sized bed
睡一张大大的双人床
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
你妈妈在一旁讲你小时候打球的故事
You taught me 'bout your past
你告诉我你的过去
Thinking your future was me
坚定地以为我就是你的未来
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
我知道时光已远去，也知道我的无能为力
And I forget about you long enough toforget why I needed to... 
我已经忘记你足够长的时间，都忘了当初为什么要去忘记你了
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
我们终于重逢了，在这小地方的午夜
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
借着冰箱里的灯光，在厨房里跳舞
Down the stairs, I was there
你家楼下，我曾驻足
I remember it all too well
清晰的画面
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
也许是变化让我们都迷失了
Maybe I asked for too much
也许是我要求太多了
But, maybe this thing was a masterpiece
但这份感情，在你亲手毁掉它之前
'Till you tore it all up
也算一份杰作吧
Running scared, I was there
曾徘徊的地方，又因恐惧离开了
I remember it all too well
清晰的记忆
And you call me up again
你再次来电
Just to break me like a promise
只为了像履行承诺一样的击碎我
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
在诚实的名义下，残忍得如此漫不经心
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
我像一张皱皱巴巴的纸，瘫坐在那里
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well
这一切，都是清晰的，清晰的，画面
Time won't fly, it's like I’m paralyzed byit
是时光停滞了，还是我麻痹了？
I'd like to be my old self again
我还是愿意做曾经的那个我
But I’m still trying to find it
但我也还在找寻着
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
那些穿格子衬衫的时光，是你曾把我当成自己的一部分的时光
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
现在你寄回我的物品，我也独自一人走路回家了
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
但你还保存着那条从一开始的旧围巾
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
因为他提醒着你，纯真
And it smells like me
也提醒着你，我的味道
You can't get rid of it
这些你也摆脱不掉吧
'Cause you remember it all too well
在你的记忆里，这也是清晰的
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
我们还是重逢了，我曾那么爱你啊
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
爱你，在你失去那些你意识到的纯真之前
It was rare, I was there, I remember itall too well
太难得可贵了，熟悉的地点，清晰的画面
Wind in my hair, you were there, youremember it all
风在我发间/你在我面前/你一定记得的
Down the stairs, you were there, youremember it all
你家楼下/你曾驻足/你一定记得的
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well...
这一切太难得，太可贵了

*Innocence
Waking up I see that everything is ok
The first time in my life
And now it's so great
Slowing down I look around
And I am so amazed
I am so amazed 

*Ready For It
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom 

*Ready For It
I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

*Innocence
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect

*Ready For It
In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby

Are you ready for it？

*Ready For It
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

*Innocence
It's the state of bliss you think
You're dreaming
It's the happiness inside
That you're feeling
It's so beautiful
It makes you wanna cry

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
（In the middle of the night in my dreams）
（You should see the things we do baby）

Are you ready for it？

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
不，在逃亡车里不会有好事发生
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
在那最佳的时期，我犯下了最糟糕的罪行
I struck a match and blew your mind
我轻轻划亮火柴，却引燃了你的内心
But I didn't mean it
但我真的不是有意的
And you didn’t see it
而你却因为爱而蒙蔽了双眼
The ties were black, the lies were white
我和你相遇在那盛装晚会，彼此间善意的谎言也在那开始
In shades of grey in candlelight
暗淡的烛光衬托出灰色的幽影（而我们在纵情跳舞）
I wanted to leave him
我当时想要离开他
I needed a reason
于是你便成为了我的救命稻草
X marks the spot where we fell apart
X标记着我们断绝的地点
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
“是他一手造成的结果”，我当时在自欺欺人
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
其实早在那晚喝第一杯古典鸡尾酒时我内心里就知道我们被诅咒了
We never had a shot, gunshot in the dark
我们间从来就没有机会，黑暗中射出的子弹将我们击中
You were drivin' the getaway car
你当时正驾驶这辆逃亡车带我逃离
We were flyin’, but we never get far
我们风驰电掣，却从未逃远
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
别假装这结果让你迷惑不解
Think about the place where you first met me
想想你初次见我时的处境吧
Ridin' in a getaway car
我们驾着逃亡车飞奔
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
其实你的心跳一直都如警笛般在警告你自己
shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
你早应该知道我也会先离你而去
Think about the place where you first met me
想想你初次见我时的处境吧
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
在一辆逃亡车里
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
不，他们从未逃远
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
不，在逃亡车里不会有好事发生
It was the great escape, the prison break
我当时逃脱了他，如逃离了监狱一样美好
The light of freedom on my face
自由的光芒洋溢在我脸上
But you weren't thinkin'
但和你逃跑之后你却没有在思考下一步计划
And I was just drinkin'
而我只是在喝酒买醉
Well, he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin’, "Go, go, go!"
突然，他追到我们车后。我惊声大叫：“快开快开！”
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
但我们三个人这样追车逃逸的场景，亲爱的，就像杂耍剧一样
And a circus ain’t a love story
而我们这样的马戏并不是爱情故事
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)
现在我们彼次都感到抱歉
X marks the spot where we fell apart
X标记着我们断绝的地点
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
这是他一手造成的结果，就和每个人都是为了自己一样
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
其实早在那晚喝第一杯古典鸡尾酒时我内心里就知道我们被诅咒了
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
它像一颗致命子弹一样，直直射穿你的心脏
You were drivin' the getaway car
你当时正驾驶这辆逃亡车带我逃离
We were flyin’, but we never get far
我们风驰电掣，却从未逃远
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
别假装这结果让你迷惑不解
Think about the place where you first met me
想想你初次见我时的处境吧
Ridin' in a getaway car
我们驾着逃亡车飞奔
There were sirens in the beat of your heart

你早应该知道我也会先离你而去
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
在一辆逃亡车里
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
不，他们从未逃远
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
不，在逃亡车里不会有好事发生
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)
逃跑后的我们环游世界，就像当年邦妮和克莱德一样
Until I switched to the other side
直到我如梦初醒
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
幡然醒悟
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)
所以别对我将你检举交给警察感到惊讶
'Cause us traitors never win
因为我们这样的叛徒是从来不会赢的
I'm in a getaway car
如今我独自一人驾车逃离
I left you in a motel bar
我把你一人留在了汽车旅馆
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
我把抢来的钱装在袋子里，还偷走了你的车钥匙
That was the last time you ever saw me
那也是你最后一次看见我
Drivin' the getaway car
回想起当时你正驾驶这辆逃亡车带我逃离
We were flyin', but we never get far (don't pretend)
我们风驰电掣，却从未逃远
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
别假装这结果让你迷惑不解
Think about the place where you first met me
想想你初次见我时的处境吧
Ridin' in a getaway car
我们驾着逃亡车飞奔
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)
其实你的心跳一直都如警笛般在警告你自己
shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
你早应该知道我也会先离你而去
Think about the place where you first met me
想想你初次见我时的处境吧
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
在一辆逃亡车里
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
不，他们从未逃远
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
不，在逃亡车里不会有好事发生
I was ridin' in a getaway car
我一个人驾驶着逃亡车
I was cryin' in a getaway car
我在逃亡车里报头大哭
I was dyin' in a getaway car
我在逃亡车里奄奄一息
Said goodbye in a getaway car
在逃往车里与世长绝

,One of the best nights
,That I've had no doubt
,Between the bottle of wine
,And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
,Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

,I knew I'd see her around
,I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
,Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
,I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
,In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
,I'd act like I didn't see her
,We'd pay at the same pumps
,Flip through the same stations
,And slow down for the same curves
,Run around with the same crowds
,We just needed some time
,She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
,Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
,I knew she'd find a way to get over me
,But I'd never thought that...
,...she would get down with somebody I know
,I guess that's just how it goes
,When you break up in a small town
,I see our friends and they put on a show
,Like they don't want me to know
,So they give me the go-around
,But there's only so many streets, so many lights
,I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
,I should've known all along
,You gotta move or move on
,When you break up in a small town
,For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
,But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
,I see 'em everywhere together
,And it's hitting a little too close to home
,She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
,She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
,She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
,In someone else's arms right down the road
,And I never thought that...
,...she would get down with somebody I know
,I guess that's just how it goes

,And I wanna jump out
,I wanna fight
,I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
,It's my fault, I let her go
,I never thought that...

,Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
,Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
,Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
,
,The kind that a rich man can't turn down
,She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
,One summer night in a dime store dress
,
,She had the looks he had the mansion
,
,And you can figure out the rest
,
,It was all roses dripping in diamonds
,
,Sipping on champagne
,
,She was all uptown wearing that white gown
,Taking his last name
,
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,
,And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,
,Yeah they're ringing
,
,Jenny was hosting junior league parties
,And having dinner at the country club
,Everyone thought they were ken and barbie
,
,But ken was always getting way too drunk
,Saturday night after a few too many
,He came home ready to fight
,
,And all his money could never save jenny
,
,From the devil living in his eyes
,
,It was all bruises covered in makeup
,
,Dark sunglasses
,
,And that next morning sitting in the back pew
,Praying with the baptist
,
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,
,You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,
,Yeah they're ringing

,No law man was ever gonna find
,
,And how he died is still a mystery
,But he hit a woman for the very last time

,
,Standing there in a black dress singing singing

,She don’t throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
,She don’t text her friends and say, I gotta get laid tonight

, Get off of work and we meet down at our spot
,We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
,it was two for one and four for two
,and christmas lights in the middle of June
,All hung up like I was on you.
,I say hey hey baby do you want to come over
,You say no way then you move in closer
,Next thing I know you were in my T-shirt
,right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
,Video, oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
,You're moving around in the TV light
,I aint ever seen anything like your dress my floor
,No way you wore my T-shirt, Yeah
,You look good in my T-shirt, oh yeah
,We be walking up the stairs
,with the neighbors saying keep it down
,But its hard to unblock the door when you're making out
,You be saying that we gotta quit doing this
,So why you leaning in for one more kiss
,and pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
,and slipping in to my T-shirt
,right there your hair messed up like a Guns 'N Roses
,Video, oh-oh so hot you still got it up in my head
,You're moving around in the TV light
,I aint ever seen anything like your dress my floor
,No way you wore my T-shirt

,
,Since you turned the tables on me
,I've been steady and learnin' lonely
,Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
,Everything from Jones to Jennings
,Slowly plannin' my survival
,In a three-foot stack of vinyl
,Since you had to walk on outta here
,I've been havin' a record year
,I bet you thought before you left
,I'd just sit in silence by myself
,Turn this house into a jail
,Dyin' slow in a livin' hell
,But love's got a funny way of keepin' score
,And your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
,I usually make it through side a sober
,All bets are off when I flip her over
,One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
,I'm havin' a record year
,Quarter notes and Hank's half time
,Are poundin' on this heart of mine
,Song to song, I pass my time
,With these speakers on ten
,Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
,Along with Songs In The Key Of Life
,I'm either gonna get over you
,Or I'm gonna blow out my ears
,Yeah, you're out there now
,Doin' God knows how, and I'm stuck here
,Havin' a record year
,Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
,I'm countin' on a needle to save me
,I drop it in the groove
,And we go 'round and 'round
,And down in a spiral
,I guess I really oughta call and thank you
,I rediscovered Red Headed Stranger
,Got down with old James Brown
,And found New Grass Revival
,If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
,For my record year
,Quarter notes and Hank's half time
,Are poundin' on this heart of mine
,Song to song, I pass my time
,With these speakers on ten
,Your good-and-gone keeps me up all night
,Along with Songs In The Key Of Life

,Yeah, you're out there now
,Doin' God knows how, but I'm stuck here
,Havin' a record year
,Yeah, I'm havin' a record year
,
,Strictly outta curiosity
,What would happen if you got with me?
,Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
,Come on skip a couple rocks with me
,Gimme any of your heart tonight
,Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
,I got somethin' we could start tonight
,Lookin' at you girl it's hard to fight
,Those stars need to be wished on
,Your skin needs to be kissed on
,My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
,T-shirt of your favorite rock band
,Checkin' your make-up in my Ray Bans
,Breakin' hearts like only you can in your snapback
,Woah oh oh oh
,Woah oh oh oh
,Woah oh oh oh
,In your snapback
,Come on baby shoot a smile at me
,Midnight selfie on a balcony
,A little somethin' for my lock screen
,You're burnin' a hole in my pocket
,And we got the beat let's drop it
,Those stars need to be wished on
,Your skin needs to be kissed on
,My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
,Tattoos, cutoffs and converse
,Singin' along to the song with the wrong words
,Every move you make baby it works in your snapback
,Woah oh oh oh
,Woah oh oh oh
,Woah oh oh oh
,In your snapback
,Those stars need to be wished on
,Your skin needs to be kissed on

, I walk in on Friday nights
, Same old bar same burned out lights
, Same people and all the same faces
, So why the hell does it feel like a different places
, Meet my friends for a girls' night out
, Seems there ain't much to talka bout
, Same drinks that we're all raising
, But all of the toasts just don't feel the same
, We used to be the life of the party
, We used to be the ones that they wished they were
, But now it's like they don't how to act
, Maybe they're like me
, And they want us back
, It's like there's always an empty space
, Those memories that nobody can erase
, Of how bright we burned well now it hurts
, But it's true
, When they think of me they think of you
, They keep asking how I am
, But they're really asking where you've been
, I can read between all of the lines
, It ain't just us missing all of the times
, We were the life of the party
, We used to be the ones that they wished they were
, But now it's like they don't how to act
, Maybe they're like me

, When they think of you
, It can burn when it's in the past
, We used to be the life of the party

,Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
,Takin' pictures of people we thought were stars
,It’s easy to give in to your heart
,When you’re drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
,When the song comin' out of the speakers
,Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
,We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
,And you kissed me, and we were …
,
,Up all night and we were feelin' so good
,Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
,We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
,We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes
,Setting the world on fire, setting the world on fire
,
,Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
,We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
,Said "Do you think we’ll live forever?" As we killed another beer
,And you wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
,We were laughin' until we were breathless
,Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
,And comin' alive and we were…
,
,Up all night and we were feelin' so good
,Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
,We were in a hotel singin' in the hallway lights
,We were strikin' the matches right down to the ashes

,Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
,You know what I'm talking about
,Hey baby, whatcha doing tonight?
,It's butterflies and Bud Lights
,Under the stars and on the stripes
,Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

,Through the speakers all night long
,Couple kids just living
,That American country love song
,In every town, in every place
,There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
,And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
,In the back of an old Ford truck
,In the bar, just looking for love
,In a pair of oh my blue eyes, let them fireworks start
,That American country love song
,Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on
,It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
,It's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
,It's one last kiss in the driveway

,So I can turn it up and maybe turn her on

,All the bad and good as it gets
,To the ones that you ain't met yet

,"Middle Of A Memory"
,Baby, it just took one look at you
,For me to change my one drink order to two
,Like we already knew each other
,Like we been talking all night
,About a minute into our first dance
,We got blindsided by your friends
,All in a hurry like you had to go
,Didn't they know you can't leave someone
,Girl, you can't leave someone
,In the middle of a dance floor all alone
,In the middle of an old school country song
,Right when I was just about to lean on in
,Why'd you have to go then?
,Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
,It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
,Girl, it ain't right, no
,How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
,We were gonna dance till they shut it down
,People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
,Thinking we were so in love, yeah
,They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
,I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
,And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
,But now I don't know where you are
,I'm under these lights right here in the dark
,In the middle of a dance floor all alone
,In the middle of an old school country song
,Right when I was just about to lean on in
,Why'd you have to go then?
,Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
,It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
,Girl, it ain't right, no
,How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory?
,Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
,Tore the back half out of a book
,And no, you'll never know
,Girl, what you did to me it ain't right saying goodbye
,In the middle of a dance floor all alone
,In the middle of what could've been our song
,Right when I was just about to lean on in
,Why'd you have to go then?
,Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
,It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
,But, girl, it ain't right, no
,How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
,In the middle of a memory
,(In the middle of a memory)
,
,The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
,One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
,The rest of the night's kind of blurry
,Now the sun's peeking through the shades
,I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way
,
,I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
,On your love, love, on your love, love
,Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
,Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love
,
,It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
,It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
,It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
,I got plenty to do just laying here with you all day
,
,I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
,On your love, love, on your love, love
,Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
,Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love
,
,Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
,Every day singing this song
,
,I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
,On your love, love, on your love, love
,Now I know why-y I'm feeling so high, high
,Cause I'm still drunk, drunk on your love, on your love
,
,(Woke up still drunk on your love)
,On your love, on your love
,On your love
,On your love, on your love

,The rain is coming down tonight
,I’m smiling looking at this photograph
,I hear that song and I’m flying right back
,To when we had it made
,Every Friday night when the sun went down
,We’d be running them streets like we owned the town
,And I just can’t let it go, no, I just can’t let it go
,I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
,Seven kids on my two lane road
,Had the guns on the radio
,After all this time it still feels, feels so good
,When I think about those summer nights
,Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
,Sipping on the local’s spark of light
,Ain’t it funny how the best days of my life
,Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
,Out of nowhere, it slipped away
,And the rope by the river hangs silently
,And the town that I knew ain’t nothing like it used to be
,Ah, I can’t explain
,They took all the color from the picture frame
,And the days got sold to the grit and the game
,But I just can’t let it go, no, I just can’t let it go
,I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
,Seven kids on my two lane road
,We had the guns on the radio
,After all this time it still feels, feels so good
,When I think about those summer nights
,Singing out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
,Sipping on the local’s spark of light
,Ain’t it funny how the best days of my life
,Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
,Swinging on the line
,Living all that wasted time
,Hey, hey, now
,Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
,Only music that we had was out the left speaker
,We were living every second ’til the time ran out
,We had nothing but we had it all
,When I think about those summer night
,Sneaking out the window, running back roads
,Your hand in mine
,We were going nowhere, we were so alive
,Uh huh, ain’t it funny how the best days of my life
,Was all that wasted time, all that wasted time
,We were swinging out on the line
,Living all that wasted time
,Hey, you know oh
,All that wasted time
,Don’t you feel it coming on back now
,Time, time, time

,You hear a new song, it's your favorite
,Pretty soon you'll be changing the station
,And all your old shoes are looking brand new
,They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
,Heavy into everything
,Ready for the next thing
,Catch a ride for a while than you're over it
,You change your mind on it
,Soon as the shines gone
,Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but
,Woahhhhh whoahhh
,I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
,Woahhhh whoahhh
,Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
,Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
,Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
,When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
,Gonna make you miss me
,You're cold and hot
,You burn out like a match
,Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
,You think it's easy, but that's a lie
,The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
,Every boy you ever met, was to easy to forget
,Well, I ain't going out like that
,Woahhh whoahh
,I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
,Woahhh whoahhh

,Woahhh whoahh
,I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
,Woahhhh whoahhh
,Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
,Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
,Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
,Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
,I'm gonna make you miss me
,Make you miss me
,Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
,When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
,I'll say baby you know all you can say
,Is come and get me
,Wanna make you miss me
,Gonna make you miss me

It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry
Five days since you laughed at me saying
Get that together come back and see me
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hood wink
As I make you stop think
You'll think you're looking at aqua man
I summon fish to the dish although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the Sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like Wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous
You'll have to sign a waiver
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said you're crazy
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait till you say you're sorry
Chickity China of the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the smoking man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm Tantric
Like snickers guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurasawa I make mad films
Okay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back swing
Gotta get in tune with sailor moon
'Cause the cartoon has got the boom Anime Babes
That make me think the wrong thing
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean?
Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said I'm sorry
Five days since I laughed at you and said
You just did just what I thought you were gonna do
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame
But what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry

Her glance hits me like lightning 
I heard that girl is fast and frightening 
Dirty hair and a laugh that's mean 
Her neighbors call her an evil machine 
She's fast, she's lean 
She's frightening 
She's fast, she's lean 
She's frightening 
Popping wheelies on her motorbike 
Straight girls wish they were dykes 
She'll do anything on a dare 
Mom and Daddy's worst nightmare 
Down at the creek smoking pot 
She eats the roach so she don't get caught 
Throws her mini off in the halls 
Got so much clit she don't need no balls

作曲 : Clor
I was in love but that was yesterday
Now I'm in pain and it's here to stay
I was the bird that buzzed the bees and stole the honey
The ones that you want they're the ones that get away
The ones that you need never wanted to stay
And there'll remain those few in-between ones, they are susceptible
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
You look a little
I was in love but that was yesterday
Now I'm in pain and it's here to stay
I was the bird that buzzed the bees and stole the honey
I was aloof
But still this fire's out
Even in spurts
Seen it all before
We get it on
If only to find out
Why we're unsuitable
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
Wide-eyed and open-mouthed
You look a little lost and found
You look a little
You look a little 

,Sometimes I feel I've got to. . . run away'
,I've got to. . . get away'
,from the pain you drive into the heart of me'
,the love we share seems to go nowhere'
,and I've lost my life'
,for I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.
,
,Once I ran to you
,this tainted love you've given.
,I gave you all a boy could give you.
,take my tears and that's not really all. . .
,Tainted love' ohh...' tainted love
,
,now I know I've got to. . . run away.
,I've got to. . . get away.
,You don't really want any more from me'
,to make things right you need someone to hold you tight'
,and you think love is to pray'
,but I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

,everyone has got a violent streak.
,I think my face looks like glass,
,but my body feels plastic.
,Melt me into a bottle.
,I wish that I was a baby sucking on myself.
,Boogie down to the water.
,I thought that maybe
,I could be the lake's daughter.
,Because I float like an infant inside of it,
,weightless in the lake.
,It's got nothing to take from me.
,I feel like a child,
,hiding behind your tombstone.
,But the graveyard's not lonely.
,Plus, who doesn't love a good cemetery?
,I feel like a fetus.
,Because my eyes are not open,
,and I don't have fingernails.
,Can't claw my way out of anyone, or anything.
,Hold me under the water,
,My lungs are filling with plankton.
,But the lake is not lonely,
,No need for you to come with me.

,In spite of being so late to the game
,I won't fight fate
,It's now too late
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew
,And every morning when I rise
,Those cold and blue eyes on the tube
,No worse came true
,The binds that break off and shatter off when you fall down from the top
,And your heart stops
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew
,And if the dawn don't break me
,If I don't become after
,No time to go back and find who was chasing which disaster
,I hold the truth like a tight noose
,And sometimes you
,It's getting hard to get along with your new love song so soon
,Can it really be true?
,The binds that break off and shatter off when you fall down from the top
,And your heart stops
,Used to be the one that knew me
,Saw through me
,Used to be the one that knew me
,You used to be the one that knew me

,She was a shark smile in a yellow van
,She came around and I stole a glance
,In my youth, a vampire
,Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
,It came over me at a bad time
,But who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line?
,I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam
,
,And she said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too
,
,It came over her at a bad time
,Riding through Winona down the dotted line
,Held us gunning out
,90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
,She looked over with a part smile
,Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
,And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering
,
,As she said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too

,Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
,I leaned over to take it in
,As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines

,And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail
,Ooh the guardrail
,Ooh the guardrail
, x2
,She said woo
,Baby, take me
,And I said woo
,Baby, take me too

,From broken hearts and broken arms
,From chasing after where you are
,I've cried a couple tears
,Been taking everything too far
,And running around in the dark
,Trying to finish what I couldn't start
,So who's gonna love you now
,That gravity brought you down
,Now that I'm might around
,Who's gonna love you now
,This is where you disappear
,After playing all your favorite cards
,A father but just on my charts
,You leave before it gets too hard
,So what are you doing here
,When everyone is at the bar
,Filling in the missing parts
,And here we are
,So who's gonna love you now
,That gravity brought you down
,Now that I'm not around
,Who's gonna love you now

,I remember thinking about all the things that I would do
,It's funny how quickly that boy became you
,Sitting here drinking away all the things that I'd have done
,While the moments slip away and another one comes
,And the years keep rolling on keep rolling on like a beating drum
,They dont blink an eye or go back for anyone
,The weirdest part of growing old is still feeling so young
,While the years keep rolling on keep rolling on keep rolling on
,I rememeber understanding I don't understand it all
,But knowing its all going somewhere and I'm part of that force
,These days my heart say you dont know nothing at all
,while the moments fall away and another one falls
,And the years keep rolling on keep rolling on like a beating drum
,They dont blink an eye or  go back for anyone
,The weirdest part of growing old is still feeling so young
,While the years keep rolling on keep rolling on keep rolling on
,And the years keep rolling on keep rolling on like a beating drum
,They dont blink an eye or slow down for anyone
,The weirdest part of growing old is still feeling so young
,While the years keep rolling on keep rolling on keep rolling on

,I think i'm more to blame
,We tried so hard to think of what it meant
,That I got lost in my thoughts
,Losing you, on the way

,I didn't think we'd meet again
,Didn't think I'd feel the same
,But now i'm fucked up and all the way
,I never thought you'd be on my way
,I wanna get out and run away
,And hope i'll never have to stop halfway
,I never knew the limits of my heart
,But now I know that the time isn't one
,Might just have to love you until I die
,Fuck this

,loving her was easier
,I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
,Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
,Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
,Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
,Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
,Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
,Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
,Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
,Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
,Coming close together with a feeling
,That I've never know before in my time
,She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
,I don't know the answer to the easy way
,She opened every door in my mind
,But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
,And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
,
  When I was a younger man,
 I thought the pain of defeat would last forever,
 But now I don't know what it would take to make my heart back down.
 
 'Cause I only have to wait a little while
 Before I get my
 Clean slate.
 
 And somewhere in another place,
 Who knows could be another life time,
 Everything we gave away returns like a seed from a fugitive tree.
 
 And you only have to wait a little while
 Before you
 Find the truth.
 
 And I only had to wait a little while
 Yeah, I only had to wait a little while (x2)
 Before I got my
 Clean slate.

,Of the love we vowed would never
,Melt like snowflakes in the sun
,My days now end as they begun:
,With thoughts of you
,
,And I think of you
,
,And think of you
,
,Down the streets I walked with you
,Seeing others doing things we do
,
,Now these thoughts are haunting me
,Of how complete I used to be
,
,And in these times that we're apart
,
,I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
,And think of you
,
,And I think of you
,
,And think of you
,
,And think of you
,
,And I do
,
,Well I'd rather go and journey
,Where the diamond crescent's glowing
,and Run across the valley
,Beneath the sacred mountain
,And wander through the forest
,Where the trees have leaves of prisms
,And break the light in colors
,That no-one knows the names of
,And when it's time i'll go and wait
,Beside a legendary fountain
,till i see your form reflected
,In it's clear and jeweled waters
,And if you think i'm ready
,You may lead me to the chasm
,Where the rivers of our vision
,Flow into one another
,
,I will watch her dive beneath
,The white cascading waters
,She may beg，She may plead
,She may argue with her logic
,And  mention all the things i'll lose
,That really have no value
,In the end she will surely know
,I wasn't born to follow

,I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead;
,I just need some place where I can lay my head.

,He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No!", was all he said.
,Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free;

,I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide;
,When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.
,I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown."

,Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say

,Neutral Milk Hotel - In The Aeroplane Over The Sea
,
,What a beautiful face
,I have found in this place
,That is circling all round the sun
,What a beautiful dream
,That could flash on the screen
,In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
,Soft and sweet
,Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
,
,And one day we will die
,And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
,But for now we are young
,Let us lay in the sun
,And count every beautiful thing we can see
,Love to be
,In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me
,
,What a curious life we have found here tonight
,There is music that sounds from the street
,There are lights in the clouds
,Anne's ghost all around
,Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
,Soft and sweet
,How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
,
,Now how I remember you
,How I would push my fingers through
,Your mouth to make those muscles move
,That made your voice so smooth and sweet
,And now we keep where we don't know
,All secrets sleep in winter clothes
,With one you loved so long ago
,Now he don't even know his name
,
,What a beautiful face
,I have found in this place
,That is circling all round the sun
,And when we meet on a cloud
,I'll be laughing out loud
,I'll be laughing with everyone I see
,Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
,
,I fall in love with a lot of the girls I see out on the street
,specially the ones that make eyecontact with me
,oh baby
,It don't mean I'm gonna leave you
,I fell in love with a girl at the grocery store
,simply because she gave me a look nobody gave me before
,oh baby
,It don't mean I'm gonna leave you
,nothing like the love I have for you
,I'm still in love with a lot of the girls I've seen
,within my dreams
,for real
,or on the screen
,or in a magazine
,oh baby
,It don't mean i'm gonna leave you

, Does goodbye mark the moment you start?
, Counting the days till the long winters through
, And I welcome you back to my heart

,He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
,A three car garage, her own credit cards
,He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
,If he could only read her mind, she'd say:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
,And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
,Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
,Would it make a difference if she said:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,And the more that he lives the less that he tries
,To show her the love that he holds inside
,And the more that she gives the more that he sees
,This is a story of you and me
,So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
,To open the door to a heart that I hurt
,And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
,Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
,I'm gonna hold you tonight

Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
Half-racked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now
I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

,I left down in New Orleans
,I left down in New Orleans
,Magnolia, you sweet thing
,You're driving me mad
,Got to get back to you, babe
,You're the best I ever had
,You're the best I ever had
,You whisper "Good morning"
,So gently in my ear
,I'm coming home to you, babe
,
,I'll soon be there
,I'll soon be there
,Magnolia, you sweet thing
,You're driving me mad
,Got to get back to you, babe

,You're the best I ever had
,You're the best I ever had

,You're the best I ever had
,You're the best I ever had
(Chris Crawford/Tom Kimmel) 
I don't need to go on pretending 
I don't need the key to your door 
Why would 
I leave goodbye open-ended 
That's not what goodbye is for 
Now I don't have one thing against you 
You're breakin' my heart not the law 
The angel 
I made you into had to fall 
I'll miss you 
I love you that's all 
Sometimes 
I get sentimental 
But what would 
I say if I called 
I feel like 
I'm caught in the middle 
Somewhere between flyin' and takin' a fall 
Now I don't have one thing against you 
You're breakin' my heart not the law 
The angel 
I made you into had to fall 
I'll miss you 
I love you that's all 
Now I don't have one thing against you 
You're breakin' my heart not the law 
The angel 
I made you into had to fall 
It's over 
I love you that's all 
I'll miss you 
I love you that's all
All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel all my passion unfolding

Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, I do

In my world before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
Until that day I found you
How you opened my life to a new paradise

In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart, until my dying day

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, yes I do

I've waited so long to say this to you
So, if you're asking if I love you this much, I do
Oh, I do
Before I die 
I wanna hit the 
Mississipi 
In a boat 
I've yet to buy 
And take it out in the gulf 
Where the water meets the sky 
To where nothin' on 
God's green earth 
Looks dry 
And I wanna see 
That stadium in 
New York From a right field seat 
Maybe catch a homerun 
When a new all-star goes deep 
And pretend that's 
Maris and 
Mantle Pointin' up at me 
While I can still breathe 
While this old heart still has another beat 
It's time 
I put some livin' to these dreams 
Before I die 
I'm gonna learn all about how man swallows pride 
And find the strength to tell my daddy he was right 
And tell mama 
I'm sorry bout that night 
Before I'm called up 
I wanna be the kinda man that a woman 
Wants to love 
And find a side of me 
That's a different kind of tough 
Who ain't ashamed to need the man above 
While I can still breathe 
While this old heart still has another beat 
It's time 
I put some livin' to these dreams 
And Lord I know 
These are things 
I should have done 
A long time ago 
And when I close my eyes 
I wanna feel at ease 
And if I left right now 
I couldn't rest in peace 
While I can still breathe 
While this old heart still has another beat 
It's time 
I put some livin' to these dreams 
Before I die 
I wanna hit the 
Mississipi 
In a boat 
I've yet to buy 
Take it out in the gulf 
Where the water meets the sky 
To where nothin' on 
God's green earth

,Seems the love I've known has always been

,I feel so old before my time
,Yesterday when I was young
,The taste of life was sweet
,as rain upon my tongue
,I teased at life
,as if it were a foolish game
,The way the evening breeze
,may tease a candle flame
,The thousand dreams I dreamed
,The splendid things I planned
,I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
,I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
,And only now I see how the years ran away
,Yesterday when I was young
,So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
,So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
,And so much pain
,my dazzled eyes refused to see
,I ran so fast that time
,and youth at last ran out
,I never stopped to think
,what life was all about
,And every conversation I can now recall
,Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
,Yesterday the moon was blue
,And every crazy day
,brought something new to do
,I used my magic age as if it were a wand
,And never saw all the waste and emptiness beyond
,The game of love I played
,with arrogance and pride
,And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
,The friends I made all seem
,somehow to drift away
,And only I'm left on stage to end the play
,There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
,I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
,The time has come for me
,To pay for yesterday
,When I was young
The first thing that 
I reach for every morning 
Is a pack of smokes layin' by my bed 
Yes I've read the surgeon general's warning 
But that don't take the warning out of them 
What I want 
And what I need 
Have always been different things 
The last thing mama reached for every 
Sunday Was my mortal soul as she walked out the door 
She'd say boy you're gonna need 
Him someday 
But I wanted to sleep off the night before 
What I want 
And what I need 
Have always been different things 
What I want is to give up 
Just let go 
And walk out on us 
But what I need 
Is to see this through 
Oh and find a way 
Back to you 
The last thing that 
I reach for every evening 
Is a woman who 
I can't reach anymore 
Time is worn the new off of the feeling 
And right now 
I want to just walk out the door 
But what I want 
And what I need 
Have always been different things 
What I want 
And what I need

I know you said when 
I left I'd regret every word, every breath
Every step, every minute without you but go do what you have to
I know I said you were wrong 
I'd move on, it was only a matter of time'
Til I'd make it without you but this wasn't about you
I said I needed space, a change of place
To go out and live my life
But I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
I admit I was wrong all along, now you're gone with all that 
I've been livin' for
And I don't wanna live without you anymore
For a couple of nights 
I was fine, 
I was high on the wine and the lights
And my new found freedom that 
I thought 
I neededBut that cold lonely room that 
I headed home to, it felt like a tomb
I just stared at the ceiling, what an empty feelin'
And baby I apologize, tell me it's not too late, yeah'
Cause I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
I admit I was wrong all along, now you're gone with all that 
I've been livin' for
And I don't wanna live without you anymore
Oh baby, I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
I admit I was wrong all along, now you're gone with all that 
I've been livin' for
And I don't wanna live without you anymore
No, I don't wanna live without you anymore

,Decorated store fronts
,
,Rusty old gas pumps
,
,Try to fill my mind up
,
,With somethin' before I go
,
,Picture postcard memories
,
,know You they always make for good company
,
,I don't know no town
,
,Like the old town
,
,Even when the miles are many
,
,I feel like I'm still around
,
,Deep inside me
,
,Like rings through an oak tree
,
,Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
,
,That keeps me turning home
,
,standin' I'm here beneath these billboard lights
,
,Takes me back to those autumn nights
,
,Hometown bleachers packed real tight
,
,we As marched down the field
,
,My feet would a swing from dropped tailgate
,
,Out on Airport Road real late
,
,No one could walk a line too straight
,usually We made it home alright
,
,And glory days I cant re-live
,
,Stories I'll never forget
,
,And I know don't no friends
,
,Like the old friends
,
,I never to seem laugh now
,
,Like I did with them
,
,But deep inside me
,
,A piece of history
,
,Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
,
,And it keeps me turning home
,
,Never twice the same way does it start
,
,And sure enough she stole my heart
,
,On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
,
,And though we tried both hard to wait
,
,We sure did love the taste
,
,Of the sweet being love made and prayin' got I it right
,
,Graduation came and went
,
,Along with all the time we spent
,
,And I don't know no love
,
,Like the first love
,
,When I think about the best times
,
,She's the one I think of
,
,Deep inside me
,
,All though the taste is bittersweet
,
,I see her smilin' even though she's gone
,
,And it keeps me turning home, yeah
,
,And it keeps me turning home
,It might be your smile,
,cause it can change my day
,Blue eyes that chase my blues away
,It might be your touch
,That keeps me coming back for more
,Loving words that keep me going strong
,That heart of hers I hang my future on
,
,What it is, well, I can't say for sure
,It's just she's got this thing about her
,She's got this thing about her
,
,Like the magic in your favorite song
,You just can't put your finger on
,In her arms when we're all alone
,I get the feeling that I've come back home
,She's got this thing about her
,
,She stops time when she moves through a room
,When she leaves she's always gone too soon
,And I'm counting down the minutes till she's back
,She's the love I've known eternally
,It always feels brand new to me
,I can't separate the fiction from the fact
,
,It's just she's got this thing about her
,She's got this thing about her
,Like a hymn in a cathedral hall
,Watching April snowflakes fall
,In her arms when we're all alone
,I get the feeling that I've come back home
,She's got this thing about her
,
,Like the magic in your favorite song
,You just can't put your finger on
,She's got this thing about her
,
,When the rain comes down
,Through the hole in the roof
,And every nail in the house
,Is coming loose
,
,A for sale sign stuck in the yard
,The day it sells is gonna break her heart
,
,She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
,Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
,We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
,I lean on her, she leans on me
,That's what we do
,When ends don't meet
,
,When I drag it home
,Dead on my feet
,If she worries at all
,She don't let on to me
,
,Her simple smile can say so much
,Her ten dollar dress looks like a million bucks
,
,She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
,Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
,We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
,I lean on her, she leans on me
,That's what we do
,When ends don't meet
,
,We hold on a little longer
,A little tighter, a little stronger
,We love a little deeper
,And we dance across the kitchen
,
,She knows I'm out there doing the best I can
,Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
,We work and scrape we fight and pray until it hurts
,I lean on her, she leans on me
,That's what we do
,Yeah that's what we do
,When ends don't meet
,When ends don't meet
,.
,I rode around long enough
,With my windows down
,Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
,I took your number and messages off my phone
,Oh, but you ain''t gone
,.
,Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,You''re dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
,But girl I''m no better off, can''t get you outta my head
,.
,Seems like your memory, has got a map of my mind
,No matter where I go, you find me every time
,Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
,And it''s driving me crazy
,.
,Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,You''re dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded,
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
,But girl I''m no better off, can''t get you outta my head
,.
,Damn, you''re hard to forget
,Oh oh oh
,.
,Yeah, wish I could close my eyes
,and not have to see you smiling
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,You''re dancing all around it, you still got me surrounded,
,Yeah, yeah, can''t get you outta my head
,I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
,But girl I''m no better off, can''t get you outta my head
,You''re nowhere close to being gone outta my head
,Mmm, outta my head
,.
,No you ain''t gone,
,No you ain''t gone,
,Yeah outta my head
,.
,
,I know where I'm going
,When I'm done here on this earth
,God's building me a mansion
,Where none of us will hurt
,I'll see ol' St. Peter
,Swing wide those pearly gates
,I don't mean to sound ungrateful
,But God I hope and pray
,There's just one dirt road
,That takes me back to a honey hole
,A hundred year old white oak tree
,Layin' shade on me
,Pickin' blackberries off the vine
,A Bobwhite whistling out through the pines
,I can't wait to walk those streets of gold
,But give me just one dirt road
,Hang up mama's clothesline
,Between those two pine trees
,Lay some round bales in a hay field
,And a bridge across the creek
,Let it wind past that white church
,Where I gave my soul to you
,And dead end at Granny's house
,Amen I'm through
,I hope there's just one dirt road
,That takes me back to a honey hole
,A hundred year old White Oak tree
,Layin' shade on me
,Pickin' blackberries off the vine
,A Bobwhite whistling out through the pines
,I can't wait to walk those streets of gold
,But give me just one dirt road
,Just one dirt road
,That takes me back to a honey hole
,A hundred year old White Oak tree
,Layin' shade on me

,I don't know why I didn't come
,I left you by the house of fun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,When I saw the break of day
,I wished that I could fly away
,Instead of kneeling in the sand
,Catching teardrops in my hand
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Out across the endless sea
,I would die in ecstasy
,But I'll be a bag of bones
,Driving down the road along
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Something has to make you run
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I feel as empty as a drum
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,What a waste, I could've been your lover
,What a waste, I could've been your friend
,Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
,When it's blowing up a storm in May
,Travel south until your skin turns, woman
,Travel south until your skin turns brown
,Put a language in your head and get on a train
,And then come back to the one you love
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part
,Of this lifetime of dreaming
,That extends to the heart
,Of this long summer feeling
,Quiet night you see the tv's glowing
,Quiet night,you here the walls are awake
,Being you, I'm getting out of a party crowd
,Can I see what's underneath your bed?
,Can I stay until the milkman's working?
,Can I stay until the café awakes?
,Do you hate me in the light? Did you get a fright?
,When you looked across from where you lay
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part
,Of this lifetime of dreaming
,That extends to the heart
,Of this long summer feeling
,All the history of wars I invent in my head

,I don't want to say goodbye
,Let the stars shine through.
,I don't want to say goodbye
,All I want to do is live with you.
,Just like the light of the morning
,After the darkness has gone
,The shadow of my love is falling
,On a place where the sun always shone.
,Don't you know that's where our hearts both belong?
,'Cause I don't want to say goodbye.

,All I want to do is live with you
,All I want to do is live with you
,I was a quick wet boy
,Diving too deep for coins
,All of your street light eyes
,Wide on my plastic toys
,And when the cops closed the fair
,I cut my long baby hair
,Stole me a dog-eared map
,And called for you everywhere
,Have I found you?
,Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
,Or lost you?
,American mouth
,Big pill looming
,Now I'm a fat house cat
,Nursing my sore blunt tongue
,Watching the warm poison rats
,Curl through the wide fence cracks
,Pissing on magazine photos
,Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean
,Blood of Christ mountain stream
,Have I found you?
,Flightless bird, grounded bleeding
,Or lost you?

,Big pill, stuck going down

,Me gustaría probar sobre tu tersa piel
,el efecto fatal de un potente abrasador
,que gota a gota de mi pecho brota orgulloso por la sed
,de entrar a tu cuerpo a poseer tu íntima desnudez.
,Y si prefieres aún te puedo inyectar lo que tú y yo sabemos,
,puedo hacer de tu cuerpo un estuche de cristal.
,Y bailaremos los dos (bailar los dos)
,sobre el tumor y el dolor (nuestro dolor)
,que provoca desesperación (una canción)
,en nuestro amor. (es nuestro amor)
,La muerte es alrededor, (alrededor)
,pero es el centro tú y yo, (somos tú y yo)
,reflejan tus ojos el frío escalpelo, (una canción)
,La sangre que nos bañó en el rito de iniciación
,un secreto me confió que ya intuía yo:
,tu carne es un mal pasajero, la muerte es una amiga fiel
,en quien si quieres confiar nunca te va a traicionar.
,Pero si los dioses te empujaran a meter la mano en el agujero,
,déjame a mi ser el primero en meter lo demás.
,Y bailaremos los dos (bailar los dos)
,sobre el tumor y el dolor (nuestro dolor)

,un último beso,
,un último beso.

,The time is right
,You hold me tight
,And love is got me high
,Please tell me, yes
,And don't say no, honey not tonight
,I need to have you next to me
,In more ways than one
,And I refuse to leave
,Till I see the morning sun
,Creep through your window pane
,'Cause love won't let me wait
,Not one more minute, baby
,The time is right
,Turned down the lights and take my hand
,We will take a flight
,And spend the night in a wonderland
,Now move a little close to me
,You owe it to yourself
,And I will selfishly
,Take a little for myself
,And it's because of you
,That love won't let me wait
,No, listen girl
,I need your love so desperately
,And only you can set me free
,When I make love to you
,We will explode in ecstasy
,And I won't take the blame
,That love won't let me wait, no
,Love won't let me wait
,My temperature's rising
,'Cause your so tantalizing
,Oh, listen girl
,Love won't let me wait
,I've been living with a shadow overhead
,I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
,I've been lonely for so long
,Trapped in the past
,I just can not seem to move on
,I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
,Just in case I ever need them again someday
,I've been setting aside time
,To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,Oh oh oh
,
,I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
,I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
,I know that it is out there
,There is got to be something for my soul somewhere
,I've  been looking for someone to share some lights
,Not just somebody just to get me through the night
,I could use some direction
,And I'm open to your suggestions
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart again
,I guess I am hoping you'll be there for me in the end
,Ho~
,Hu yeah~ ng~~
,There are moments when I don't know if it's real
,Or if anybody feels the way I feel
,I need inspiration
,Not just another negotiation
,
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,And if I open my heart to you
,I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
,And if you help me to start again
,You know that I'll be there for you in the end
,Ho~
,Da da la ta la~
,Ho~
,
,
,
,
,I found that record you'd been looking for,
,Yesterday.
,The one I'd been searching for forever.
,I played that record all night.
,You were right,
,The last song will say it all.
,Even though it skipped a bit,
,It sounded better.
,I never.
,I never.
,I never knew,
,The only way to listen to a record like that,
,Is to play it through.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Yeah, all of this means nothing.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Without you.
,I packed up the car,
,And started to drive.
,Without a plan, with no direction.
,You said it'd be good for me,
,To break out of my daily routine.
,You were always trying to teach some lesson.
,You wanted.
,You wanted.
,You wanted me,
,To feel the open road,
,With the wind on my face.
,Well I'm here and I'm finally free.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Yeah, all of this means nothing.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Without you.
,You and I were partners in crime,petty thieves in the lineup
,But somehow we wound up here.
,I'm looking at a letter that I wrote to you long ago,
,I wouldn't even know now where to send it.
,It's funny how it all poured out on paper.
,If only I had found a way to tell you.
,If only.
,If only.
,If only you,
,Had found a way to love me for who I am,
,The way that I loved you.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Yeah, all of this means nothing.
,But all of this means nothing.
,Without, without, without, without
,Without you.

,Money is not evil by itself
,Its just paper with perceived value to obtain other things we value in other ways
,If not money – what is evil you may ask?
,Evil is the unquenchable, obsessive and moral bending desire for more
,Evil is the bottomless, soulless and obsessive-compulsive pursuit of some pot of gold
,at the end of some rainbow which doesn’t exist
,Evil is having a price tag for your heart and soul in exchange for financial success at any cost
,Evil is trying to buy happiness, again and again
,until all of those fake, short lived mirages of emotions are gone
,Make more time
,I’m not saying you can’t be financially successful
,I’m saying have a greater purpose in life well beyond the pursuit of financial success
,Your soul is screaming for you to answer your true calling
,You can change today if you redefine what success is to you
,You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones
,You can forgive yourself and others who’ve hurt you
,You can become a leader by mentoring with others who you aspire to be like
,You can re-balance your priorities in life
,You can heal your marriage and recreate a stronger love than you ever thought possible
,You can become the best parent possible at any age – even 86
,but don’t wait until then…
,You will always be able to make more money
,But you cannot make more time

,She hangs out every day nearby the beach
,Havin' a Heineken fallin' asleep
,She looks so sexy when she's walking the sand
,Nobody ever put a ring on her hand
,Swim to the oceanshore fish in the sea
,She is the story the story is she
,She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
,Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why
,She is the one that you never forget
,She is the heaven-sent angel you met
,Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
,She is so pretty all over the world
,She puts the rhythm, the beat in the drum
,She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone
,Every little hour every second you live
,Trust in eternity that's what she gives
,She looks like Marilyn, walks likeSuzanne
,She talks like Monica and Marianne
,She wins in everything that she might do
,And she will respect you forever just you
,She is the one that you never forget
,She is the heaven-sent angel you met
,Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
,She is so pretty all over the world

,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
,I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
,High off of love drunk from my hate
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
,I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
,She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
,And I love it, wait
,Where you going, I'm leaving you
,No you ain't, come back
,We're running right back, here we go again
,It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
,I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
,But when it's bad, it's awful
,I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
,I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
,I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength（ I don't know my own strength）
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,You ever love somebody so much
,You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
,And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
,You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
,Now you're in each others face,
,Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
,You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
,Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
,It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
,So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
,Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over, it's a different day
,Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
,Next time you'll show restraint
,You don't get another chance,
,Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave,
,Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane（that's why they call it window pane）
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,Now I know we said things, did things
,That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
,Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
,You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
,Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
,Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
,Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
,Next time, there will be no next time
,I apologize even though I know it's lies
,I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie

,Trust me. on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
,Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing
,Halfway cross that city with the backpack

,Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see,
,and my girl she wanna see Rome
,Ceasar will make you a believer
,Nah I never ever did it for a throne
,That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
,
,Nah sing a song and it goes like

,Raise those hands, this is our party
,We came here to live life like nobody was watching

,Hearing you whisper through the phone
,Wait for me to come home
,Black flies on the windowsill
,That we are
,That we are
,That we are to know
,Winter stole summer's thrill
,And the river's cracked and cold
,
,See the sky is no man's land
,A darkened plume to stay
,Hope here needs a humble hand
,Not a fox found in your place
,
,And no man is an island, oh this I know

,Comfort came against my will
,And every story must grow old

,
,And no man is an island, oh this I know
,But can't you see, oh?

,I'll keep you safe
,You keep me strong
,Remember when we cut our hair?
,We both looked like boys but we didn't care
,Stick it out together like we always do

,
,No one asks me for dances because I only know how to flail
,
,I always hit like I'm drowning dead arms around him
,I'd rather stand still hold tightly to the walls
,No care no care in the world
,No care no care in the world
,I don't care I don't care anymore
,I don't care I don't care
,Love you in a panic because I prefer to sit on fences
,Spit-kissing on my sickbed
,I'm not searching for replacements
,But we are like broken instruments
,Twisted up and wheezing out the runnels
,Sleepless folks watching light grow
,Through their early morning windows
,
,I don't care I don't care anymore
,I don't care I don't care
,Oh I'm too drunk to fight hurlings curses at your surface
,Because I'm aware because it hurts that I'm in love again
,And you have kissed my neck so your arguments are insane
,Fighting over the way something was said
,Well I'm still here like a cheap threat
,
,No care no care in the world
,
,No care no care in the world
,
,I don't care I don't care anymore
,I don't care I don't care
,Oh there has only been one time where we fucked
,And I felt like a bad memory
,Like my spine was a reminder of her
,And you said that you felt sick
,I was so heavy hearted lying side-on with you afterwards
,How I wanted you to promise we would only make
,How I wanted you to promise we would only make
,How I wanted you to promise we would only make love
,But my mouth felt like I was choking broken glass
,So I just slept it off
,
,You see my mouth felt like it could talk the end of us
,So I just slept it off slept it off
,No care no care in the world
,No care no care
,

,Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
,Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.
,From the perfect start to the finish line.
,And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones.
,'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
,Setting fire to our insides for fun
,Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
,The lovers that went wrong.
,We are the reckless
,We are the wild youth
,Chasing visions of our futures
,One day we'll reveal the truth

,And you caused it,
,And you caused it,
,And you caused it,
,Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette,
,I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget,
,And my eyes are damp from the words you left,
,Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
,Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
,And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one,
,'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
,Setting fire to our insides for fun,
,To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
,But I'm forever missing him.
,And you caused it,

,No…
,I really don’t think so
,that you’d think I’d be incapable
,of being on my own
,
,No…
,I really don’t think so
,that I would for a second let you
,back in through my door
,
,I have spent
,many a-nights even when
,you were by my side
,I shed tears I couldn’t dry
,I shed tears I couldn’t dry
,But I should thank you for
,taking my blindfold off
,now I ain’t jaded no more, no more
,And I take pride
,in bein’ the one that said goodbye
,that could only mean
,I am me, once more
,
,You would turn
,your head the other way
,so you wont have to listen
,to what I had to say
,You assumed
,that I needed you
,but you didnt realize that
,I needed no one but myself
,I needed no one but myself

,
,When you were very young,
,the world was younger than you,
,As merry as a carousel,
,The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky,
,Above the ring I loved so well.
,Now the young world has grown old,
,gone are the silver and gold,
,Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,
,Old girl, you're through.
,Just sit there and count your little fingers,
,unlucky little girl blue.
,Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you,
,It's time you knew,
,All you can count on are the raindrops that
,fall on little girl blue.
,No use, old girl, you might as well surrender,
,Your hopes are getting slender,
,Why won't somebody
,send a tender blue boy to cheer up little girl blue.
,No use old girl
,You might as well surrender
,'Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
,Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
,To cheer up little girl blue
,I waited 'til I saw the sun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I left you by the house of fun
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,When I saw the break of day
,I wished that I could fly away
,Instead of kneeling in the sand
,Catching teardrops in my hand
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Out across the endless sea
,I would die in ecstasy
,But I'll be a bag of bones
,Driving down the road along
,My heart is drenched in wine
,But you'll be on my mind
,Forever
,Something has to make you run
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I feel as empty as a drum
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,I don't know why I didn't come
,There's no combination of words
,I could put on the back of a postcard
,No song that I could sing
,But I can try for your heart
,Our dreams--and they are made out of real things
,like a shoebox of photographs
,with sepia-toned loving
,Love is the answer
,at least for most of the questions in my heart
,Why are we here? and where do we go?
,And how come its so hard?
,Not always easy and
,sometimes life can be deceiving
,I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
,
,Chorus:
,Mmm' Its always better when we're together
,Yeah we'll look at the stars when we're together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,And all of these moments
,just might find their way into my dreams tonight
,But I know that they’ll be gone
,when the morning light sings
,or brings new things
,for tomorrow night you see
,that they’ll be gone too'
,too many things I have to do
,But if all of these dreams might find their way
,into my day to day scene
,I'd be under the impression
,i was somewhere in between
,With only two'
,Just me and you'
,Not so many things we got to do
,or places we got to be
,We'll Sit beneath the mango tree
,
,yeah its always better when we're together
,Mmm We're somewhere in between together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,
,I believe in memories
,they look so pretty when I sleep
,And when I wake up'
,you look so pretty sleeping next to me
,But there is not enough time'
,and there is no song I could sing
,and there is no combination of words I could say
,but I will still tell you one thing
,We're Better together
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,There's nothing for me, in this world full of strangers
,It's all someone else's idea
,I don't belong here, and you can't go with me
,You'll only slow me down
,
,Until I send for you, don't wear your hair that way
,If you cannot be true, I'll understand
,Tell all the others, you'll hold in your arms
,That I said I'd come back for you
,I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
,That's all that I can do
,
,And if I have to go, will you remember me?
,Will you find someone else, while I'm away?
,See the pyramids along the Nile
,Watch the sun rise from the tropic isle
,Just remember darling all the while
,You belong to me
,See the market place in old Algiers
,Send me photographs and souvenirs
,Just remember till a dream appears
,You belong to me
,And I'll be so alone without you
,Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue
,Fly the ocean in a silver plane
,See the jungle when it's wet with rain
,Just remember till you're home again
,You belong to me
,(MUSIC)
,Oh I'll be so alone without you
,Maybe you'll be lonesome too
,Fly the ocean in a silver plane
,See the jungle when it's wet with rain
,Just remember till you're home again
,You belong to me
,Do you know what's worth fighting for'
,When it's not worth dying for?
,Does it take your breath away
,And you feel yourself suffocating?
,Does the pain weigh out the pride?
,And you look for a place to hide?
,Did someone break your heart inside?
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,When you're at the end of the road
,And you lost all sense of control
,And your thoughts have taken their toll
,When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
,Your faith walks on broken glass
,And the hangover doesn't pass
,Nothing's ever built to last
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,Did you try to live on your own
,When you burned down the house and home?
,Did you stand too close to the fire?
,Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
,When it's time to live and let die
,And you can't get another try
,Something inside this heart has died
,You're in ruins
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,One' 21 guns
,Lay down your arms
,Give up the fight
,One' 21 guns
,Throw up your arms into the sky'
,You and I
,Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
,I was in your sights, you got me alone
,You found me, you found me, you found me
,I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
,And when I fell hard you took a step back
,Without me, without me, without me
,And he's long gone when he's next to me
,And I realize the blame is on me
,'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,No apologies, he'll never see you cry
,Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
,You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
,Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
,And now I see, now I see, now I see
,He was long gone when he met me
,And I realize the joke is on me, hey!
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,And the saddest fear comes creeping in
,That you never loved me or her,
,or anyone, or anything, yeah
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,'Til you put me down, oh
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,So shame on me now
,Flew me to places I'd never been
,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
,Trouble, trouble, trouble
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name

,Staring blankly ahead
,Just making my way
,Making a way
,Through the crowd
,And I still need you
,And I still miss you
,And now I wonder
,If I could fall into the sky
,Do you think time, would pass us by
,Cause you kow I'd walk a thousand miles
,If I could just see you...
,If I could fall into the sky
,Do you think time would pass me by
,Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
,If I could just see you...
,If I could just hold you...
,Tonight
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I can't tell you what it really is
,
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
,High off of love, drunk from my hate,
,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.
,Wait! Where you going?
,"I'm leaving you"
,No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
,Here we go again
,It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great
,I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
,But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped
,Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
,I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
,I guess I don't know my own strength
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
,When you're with 'em
,You meet and neither one of you even knows what hit 'em
,Got that warm fuzzy feeling
,Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
,You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
,Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em
,Throw 'em down pin 'em
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's the rage that took over it controls you both
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over, it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pane
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,
,Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
,And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
,But your temper's just as bad as mine is
,You're the same as me
,But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,I'm just gonna
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
,But that's alright because I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,I love the way you lie
,Come on skinny love just last the year
,Pour a little salt we were never here
,My my my my my my my my
,Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
,I tell my love to wreck it all
,Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
,My my my my my my my my
,Right in the moment this order's tall
,I told you to be patient
,I told you to be fine
,I told you to be balance

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing:
,"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
,One minute I held the key
,Next the walls were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can not explain
,Once you go there was never, never an honest word
,That was when I ruled the world
,
,It was the wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in.
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People could not believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries Wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever want to be king?

,Be my mirror my sword and shield

,Just me and you park on the edge of the world
,That's how I wanna see you girl.
,I can see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
,Moving your hips like wind moves cotten
,You can get the whole wide country side hoppin'
,ooh, ooh, bring the beat back, ooh, ooh
,Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
,Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
,You sure know how to shake it alright
,Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
,Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
,Just me and you park on the edge of the world

,Yeah, that's how I wanna see you girl.
,Come on come on come on let me see you girl.
,
,You ain’t got a dress that I don’t like
,You ain’t got a pair of jeans that don’t fit you just right
,There’s not a minute in the day
,That you don’t knock me out, you don’t blow me away
,But, girl, now that the sun's gone down
,Whoa-oh-oh
,Looking at you right here and now, baby
,Something about that southern sky
,Sitting back behind that moon
,It goes perfect with your eyes
,Girl, tonight looks good on you
,It's something about the way you're smiling
,Making the stars fall right on queue
,I just gotta tell you, baby
,Tonight looks good on you
,I can taste the midnight on your lips
,Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
,Wind blowing your hair around
,Girl, it makes me want to lay you down
,You've been beautiful a million times
,But I've never seen you look like this, no
,Something about that southern sky
,Sitting back behind that moon
,It goes perfect with your eyes
,Girl, tonight looks good on you
,It's something about the way you're smiling
,Making the stars fall right on queue
,I just gotta tell you, baby
,Tonight looks good on you
,Looks so good on your skin
,I don't ever, no, I never,
,I don't ever, ever want to end, baby
,Something about that southern sky
,Sitting back behind that moon
,It goes perfect with your eyes

,I just gotta tell you, baby
,Tonight looks good on you
,Tonight looks good on you
,I just gotta tell you, baby
,You look good at party
,Good at the bar
,Something 'bout underneath these stars
,You look good at the house
,Good in the car
,You're looking so good anywhere you are
,Tonight, tonight looks good on you
,Tonight looks good on you
,I just gotta tell you, baby, yeah
,Never thought you'd pick up the phone
,It's Friday night you should be out on the town
,Didn't think you'd be sitting at home all alone like me
,Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
,Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
,and the way it was
,Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
,I can be there in 5,
,one more one last time
,We don't have to be lonely tonight
,Need you, want you, I'm right here
,We don't have to be lonely tonight
,I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
,I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
,I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
,When the sun comes up we can both move on
,But we don't have to be lonely tonight
,That taste that touch,
,the fire I miss, those kiss me eyes
,Your red wine lips on mine like it used to be
,Baby I want you, and you want me
,We don't have to be lonely tonight
,Need you, want you, I'm right here
,We don't have to be lonely tonight
,I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
,I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
,I just wanna hold you 'til the heartbreak's gone
,When the sun comes up we can both move on
,But we don't have to be lonely tonight
,I could be there in 5
,One more, one last time
,We don't have to be lonely tonight
,Oh, I need you, and I'm right here
,We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight
,It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
,And that I've been waking up alone
,Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
,That you ain't ever coming home
,But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
,Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
,So I'm heading on out the door
,Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
,Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
,Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
,Save it for a rainy day
,When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
,The feel of the wind on my face
,I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
,Too busy taking all the blame
,But a drink, or two, is a foolproof remedy
,It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
,Kinda making eyes at me
,Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
,Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
,Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
,Save it for a rainy day
,Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
,And they're all too high to be bringing them down
,If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
,I'll save it for a rainy day
,There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
,And how'd I let you get away
,But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
,Is just gonna have to wait
,Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
,Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
,Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
,Save it for a rainy day
,Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
,And they're all too high to be bringing them down
,If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
,I'll save it for a rainy day
,Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away

,这首诗 写在十年前的某个凌晨四点
,颜社工作室 你一个人的时间
,安静的黑夜该算今天或明天
,卷起一根烟 面对又要逼近的期限
,如果你忘记 我帮你做个提醒
,你这时 正在酝酿一张很屌的专辑
,来自最大管的团体
,需要的只是时间不是指点
,批评什么 我才不管你
,疏远了所有人际关系 我没有空
,什么都没了那也没关系 我还有梦
,当初玩饶舌 只想挣脱束缚和期待
,但现在却意外 比过去扛得重
,最后一次点火突然懂了所谓烟到尽头
,当我无技可施忘掉一切放手一搏
,如果这是 我此生写的最后一首饶舌歌
,那我该如何记载呢
,于是我找了鼓 找了你会中的sample
,原曲可能是1999年你最爱的一首
,那时你甚至还没饶舌梦
,过两年你才开始写歌 写到现在是个饶舌歌手
,能帮你把这首歌 做成你最爱的样子
,你最爱的beatz and flow
,或许十年后还是这样子
,听到hiphop会想跟着点头
,希望你听到现在 头早就跟着点
,想起二十年前为什么会玩饶舌
,为什么逃家 又为什么重考呢
,想起一路走到这里 你值得为自己骄傲
,但未来的路怎么走 我不免感到焦躁
,总是缅怀过去 你很少想以后
,用饶舌写备忘录我必须自己做
,让以后世界发现以前台湾也有这种音乐
,我可以 you gotta believe me
,你应该38了 如果我能改变得了什么
,你应该算是发了
,你是否还在吃药
,是否回到中间值或疯癫到让人耻笑
,那你爸妈呢 是否签了离婚同意书
,你是否有把他们跟他们的故事都记住
,希望能让他们不再因为没钱不快乐
,是我这时的愿望 希望你早做到了
,还有以前那些玩音乐的朋友
,不管在做什么应该各有各的成就
,如果还有连络 请帮我问候他们
,你在我这样的岁数是跟他们一起混
,对了 我很抱歉我们把你身体弄坏
,我会开始养生 希望你还能做爱
,我正要往你那出发 我会努力到达
,把杜振熙交给你 我希望你也鼓励到他
,如果想起什么写些什么还我
,给你孩子听 跟他说你是我
,如果他喜欢 摸摸他的头说你识货
,教他听hip hop 就像你试过

,如果说你是海上的烟火
,我是浪花的泡沫
,某一刻你的光照亮了我
,如果说你是遥远的星河
,耀眼得让人想哭
,我是追逐着你的眼眸
,总在孤单时候眺望夜空
,我可以跟在你身后
,像影子追着光梦游
,我可以等在这路口
,不管你会不会经过
,每当我为你抬起头
,连眼泪都觉得自由
,有的爱像阳光倾落边拥有边失去着
,如果说你是夏夜的萤火
,孩子们为你唱歌
,那么我是想要画你的手
,你看我多么渺小一个我
,因为你有梦可做
,也许你不会为我停留
,那就让我站在你的背后

,你说对吗 别让你父母为了你去心碎

,HEY NOMAD THE PARTY,DON'T STOP
,我们在街上长大 PASSY IN MY CAR
,装逼谁都会 谁也不是天生背金龟壳
,不是谁都配来掌控你人生的新规则
,我们性格一样 但分得清 聪明和笨
,难道纹身的孩子就证明这辈子只能在社会上混？
,早看透了 这城市之中哪还有义愤填膺
,把真实的一面骂醒吧 孩子趁你年轻

,我喜欢看一些励志的书
,到一半总是被感动到哭
,有煽情的一面 但保证 我比你想象中的要污
,不会讨女孩喜欢装模作样 比手势biubiubiu
,不爱流行音乐 我们张嘴只会Check it outyoyoyo
,成绩早过你八倍 忙着如何赚钱再消费
,我在意银行卡上的数字 可能你还在花钱撩妹
,可以看不起我们扎堆 但风我们不瞎追
,可以说我们装逼 包括新浪认证加V
,我们做不到听话的孩子 你觉得我们很坏吧？
,唱出真实的想法和态度 难道会没人爱吗？
,人像杯水
,不管你是对或错 做到心灵要美
,说出的话千万别后悔
,但是要管住你自己的嘴
,我们天生就很真诚 撕烂了你的套路
,你身上没有BUFF 嘴别臭的像条抹布
,做你喜欢做的事儿 这辈子潇洒依旧

,而云朵太远太轻
,辗转之后各安天命
,我未入过繁华之境

,你的指尖轻柔
,抚摸过我所有
,风浪冲撞出的丑陋疮口
,你眼中有春与秋
,胜过我见过爱过
,的一切山川与河流
,曾以为我肩头
,是那么的宽厚
,足够撑起海底那座琼楼
,而在你到来之后
,它显得如此清瘦
,我想给你能奔跑的岸头
,让你如同王后

,到了这个年纪 还有什么看不清
,来往的人寒暄几句 不过随口一提
,想想事到如今 一事无成的如今
,没有个像样的伴侣 浪费不少真心
,朋友不常联络 偶尔谁失恋难过
,喝几杯酒 也没话好说
,

,说年轻不年轻 还是有些脾气
,依然缺根神经 盲目讲义气
,只是受点伤 都不足为提

,谁来来去去 都好像麻痹
,几句甜言蜜语 虚情或假意
,才明白爱你的人 从来不爱说明
,
,到了这个年纪 难免有不少秘密
,人前多光鲜亮丽 其实都不像自己
,生活常不如意 还不是要依赖家里
,曾经满口的爱情 现在不知在哪里
,还是不够聪明 否则怎么会叹气
,曾经的死心塌地 现在连名字都忘记
,
,不知不觉也已经21
,有好多话 不知说给谁听
,给他发条简讯 迟迟没有回应
,久了反而心中更平静

,掉泪也不一定有人注意
,一个人看电影 一个人散心
,心有余力 就拿来安慰自己

,Hello darkness my old friend.
,I've come to talk with you again.
,Because a vision softly creeping
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
,And the vision that was planted in my brain
,Still remains within the sound of silence
,In restless dreams I walked alone
,narrow streets of cobblestone
,Neath the halo of a streetlamp,
,I turned my collar to the cold and damp
,When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
,split the night
,And touched the sound of silence
,And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
,People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
,People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
,To stir the sound of silence
,Fool, said I, you do not know
,silence, like a cancer, grows
,Hear my words and I might teach you
,take my arms then I might reach you
,But my words, like silent raindrops fell
,and echoed in the wells of silence
,And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they'd made
,And the sign flashed its warning in the words that it was forming
,And the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
,And tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence
,
,
,There's  a  kind  of  hush  all  over  the  world  tonight.
,All  over  the  world  you  can  hear  the  sound  of  lovers  in  love.
,You  know  what  I  mean.
,Just  the  two  of  us,and  no-body  else  in  sight.
,There's  nobody  else  and  I'm  feeling  good  just  holding  you  tight.
,So  listen  very  care-fully.
,Get  closer  now  and  you  will  see  what  I  mean.
,It  isn't  a  dream.
,The  only  sound  that  you  will  hear  is  when  I  whis-per  in  your  ear,"I  love  you  for-e-ver  and  e-ver."
,There's  a  kind  of  hush  all  over  the  world  tonight.

, but the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time.

, I was the black sheep of the family.
,You tried to teach me right from wrong.
, Too much wine and too much song.
, Wonder how I got along.

, but the wine and the song,
, like the seasons, have all gone.
, Goodbye, Michelle, my little one.
,You gave me love and helped me find the sun.
, And every time that I was down,
, you would always come around,
,and get my feet back on the ground.
, Goodbye, Michele.
,It's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky
,Now that spring is in the air,
,with the flowers everywhere,
, I wish that we could both be there.
, We had joy, we had fun,
, we had seasons in the sun,
, but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach.

The snowflakes fall as winter calls and time just seems to fly
Is it the loneliness in me that makes me want to cry
My heart is sad like a morning dove that's lost its mate in flight
Hear the cooing of his lonely heart through the stillness of the night
Whispering pines whispering pines tell me is it so
Whispering pines whispering pines you're the one who knows
My darling's gone oh she's gone and I need your sympathy
Whispering pines send my baby back to me
,
See that squirrel up in the tree his mate there on the ground
Hear their barking call of love of the happiness they found
Is my love still my love oh this I gotta know
Send a mesaage by the wind because I love her so
Whispering pines...

,Why do the stars glow above
,Don't they know this's the end of the world
,It ended when I lost your love
,I wake up in the morning and I wonder
,Why everything is the same as it was

,Why does my heart go on beating
,Why do these eyes of mine cry

,Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
,Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
,Remember me to one who lives there
,She once was a true love of mine
,
,Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
,(Oh the sides of a hill in the deep forest green)
,Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
,(Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown)
,Without no seams nor need work
,(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
,Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
,(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
,
,Tell her to find me on acre of land
,(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
,Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
,(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
,Between the salt water and the sea strand
,(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
,Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
,
,Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
,(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalion)
,Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
,(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
,And gather it all in a bunch of heather
,(And to fight for a cause they\'ve long ago forgotten)
,Then she\'ll be a true love of mine
,
,Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
,Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
,Remember me to one who lives there
,She once was a true love of mine

,Down the way where the nights are gay
,And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop

,But when i reached jamaica i made her stop
,
,Chorus:Now i'm sad to say
,I'm on my way (on my way)
,I won't be back for many a day
,My heart is down
,My head is turning around

,Sounds of laughter everywhere
,And the dancing girls sway to and fro
,I must declare my heart is there
,Though i have been from maine to mexico

,
,Early one morning one morning in spring.
,To hear the birds whistle.
,The nightingale sing.
,I met a fair maiden who sweety did sing.
,I'm going to be married next Monday morning.
,How old are you my fair young maid.
,Here in this valley,this valley so green.
,How old are you my fair young maid.
,I'm going to be sixteen next Monday morning.
,Well sixteen years old. 16
,That's too young for to marry.
,So make my advice five years longer to tarry.
,For marriage brings troubles and sorrows begin.
,Begin so put off your wedding for Monday morning.
,You talk like a mad man, a man with no skill.
,Two years I've been waiting against my own will.
,And now I'm determined to have my own way.
,And I'm going to be married next Monday morning.
,Next Monday morning the bells they'll ring.
,My true love'll buy me a gay golden ring.
,Also he'll buy me a new pretty gown.
,To wear at my wedding next Monday morning.
,Next Monday night when I go to my bed.
,And I turn around to the man that I've wed.
,Around his middle my two arms I'll fling.
,And I wish to my soul it was Monday morning.
,
,Well I'll be damned
,Here comes your ghost again
,But that's not unusual
,It's just that the moon is full
,And you happened to call
,And here I sit
,Hand on the telephone
,Hearing a voice I'd known
,A couple of light years ago
,Heading straight for a fall
,
,As I remember your eyes
,Were bluer than robin's eggs
,My poetry was lousy you said
,Where are you calling from
,A booth in the midwest
,
,Ten years ago
,I bought you some cufflinks
,You brought me something
,We both know what memories can bring
,They bring diamonds and rust
,
,Well you burst on the scene
,Already a legend
,The unwashed phenomenon
,The original vagabond
,You strayed into my arms
,And there you stayed
,Temporarily lost at sea
,The Madonna was yours for free
,Yes the girl on the half-shell
,Could keep you unharmed
,
,Now I see you standing
,With brown leaves falling around
,And snow in your hair
,Now you're smiling out the window
,Of that crummy hotel
,Over Washington Square
,Our breath comes out white clouds
,Mingles and hangs in the air
,Speaking strictly for me
,We both could have died then and there
,
,Now you're telling me
,You're not nostalgic
,Then give me another word for it
,You who are so good with words
,And at keeping things vague
,Because I need some of that vagueness now
,It's all come back too clearly
,I loved you dearly
,And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
,I've already paid
,
,Rows and floes of angel hair
,
,And ice cream castles in the air
,And feather canyons everywhere
,I`ve looked at clouds that way
,
,But now they only block the sun
,They rain and snow on evryone
,So many things I would have done
,But clouds got in my way
,
,I`ve looked at clouds from both sides now
,From up and down, and still somehow
,It`s cloud illusions I recall
,I really don`t know clouds at all
,（-------- Misic --------）
,Moons and junes and ferris wheels
,The dizzy dancing way you feel
,As every fairy tale comes real
,I`ve looked at love that way
,
,But now it`s just another show
,You leave them laughing when you go
,And if you care, don`t let them know
,Don`t give yourself away
,
,I`ve looked at love from both sides now
,From give and take, and still somehow
,It`s loves illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,Tears and fears and feeling proud
,To say I love you right out loud
,Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
,I`ve looked at life that way
,
,But now old friends are acting strange
,They shake their heads,They say I`ve changed
,Somethings lost
,Somethings gainedIn living every day
,
,I`ve looked at life from both sides now
,From win and lose and still somehow
,It`s lifes illusions I recall
,I really don`t know love at all
,
,
,
,
,I never dare to reach for the moon
,I never tought I'd know heaven so soon
,I couldn't hope to say how I feel
,The joy in my heart no words can reveal
,Over and over I whisper your name
,Over and over I kiss you again
,I see the light of love in your eyes
,Love is forever no more good byes
,Now just a memory the tears that I cried
,Now just a memory the sighs that I sighed
,Dreams that I cherished all have come true
,All my tomorrows I give to you
,Over and over I whisper your name
,Over and over I kiss you again
,I see the light of love in your eyes
,Love is forever no more good byes
,Life's summer leaves may turn into gold
,The love that we share will never grow old
,Here in your arms no words far away
,Here in your arms forever I'll stay
,Over and over I whisper your name
,Over and over I kiss you again
,I see the light of love in your eyes
,Love is forever no more good byes
,Over and over I whisper your name
,Over and over I kiss you again
,I see the light of love in your eyes
,Love is forever no more good byes

,Once upon a time
,There was a tavern
,Where we used to raise a glass or two
,Remember how we laughed away the hours
,And dreamed of all the great things we would do?
,Then the busy years went rushing by us
,We lost our starry notions on the way
,If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
,We'd smile at one another and we'd say
,Those were the days my friend
,We thought they'd never end
,We'd sing and dance forever and a day
,We'd live the life we choose
,We'd fight and never lose
,For we were young and sure to have our way
,Di Di Di Di...
,Those were the days
,oh yes those were the days
,Just tonight I stood before the tavern.
,Nothing seemed the way it used to be
,In the glass I saw a strange reflection
,Was the lonely woman really me?
,Those were the days, my friend.
,We thought they d never end
,We'd sing and dance for ever and a day
,We'd live the life we choose
,We'd fight and never lose
,For we were young and sure to have our way
,Di Di Di Di...
,Those were the days
,oh yes those were the days
,Through the door there came familiar laughter
,I saw your face and heard you call my name
,Oh, my friends, we are older but no wiser
,For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
,Those were the days, my friend
,We thought they d never end
,We'd sing and dance for ever and a day
,We'd live the life we choose
,We'd fight and never lose
,For we were young and sure to have our way
,Di Di Di Di...
,Once there were green fields kissed by the sun.
,Once there were valleys where rivers used to run.
,Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above.
,Once they were part of an everlasting love.
,We were the lovers who strolled through green fields.
,
,Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun.
,Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run.
,Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart.
,Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
,Where are the green fields that we used to roam ?
,
,I'll never know what made you run away.
,How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day.
,I only know there's nothing here for me.
,Nothing in this wide world, left for me to see.
,
,Still I'll keep on waiting until you return.
,I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn.
,You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam,
,You can't be happy until you bring it home.
,Home to the green fields and me once again.
,
,Well, I know it's kind of late
,I hope I didn't wake you
,But what I got to say can't wait
,I know you'd understand
,Every time I tried to tell you
,The words just came out wrong
,So I'll have to say I love you in a song
,
,Yeah, I know it's kind of strange
,But everytime I'm near you
,I just run out of things to say
,I know you'd understand
,Every time I tried to tell you
,The words just came out wrong
,So I'll have to say I love you in a song
,
,Everytime the time was right
,All the words just came out wrong

,I am just a poor boy
,though my story's seldom told.
,I have squandered my resistance
,for a pocketful of mumbles'
,such are promises.
,All lies and jest.
,Still' a man hears what he wants to hear
,and disregards the rest.
,Mmm.......
,Mmm.......
,When I left my home
,and my family.
,I was no more than a boy.
,In the company of strangers'
,in the quiet of the railway station
,running scared.
,Laying low'
,seeking out the poorer quarters
,where the ragged people go.
,Looking for the places
,only they would know.
,Lie-la-lie.....
,Lie-la-lie.....
,Asking only workman's wages'
,I come looking for a job
,but I get no offers.
,Just a come-on from the whores
,on Seventh Avenue.
,I do declare'
,there were times
,when I was so lonesome
,I took some comfort there.
,Lie-la-lie.....
,
,Lie-la-lie.....
,Lie-la-lie.....
,
,Then I'm laying out
,my winter clothes
,and wishing I was gone.
,Going home'
,where the New York City winters
,aren't bleeding me.
,Leading me
,going home.
,
,In the clearing stands a boxer'
,and a fighter by his trade.
,And he carries the reminders
,of ev'ry glove that laid him down
,or cut him till he cried out.

,Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
,And frolicked in the autumn mist
,in a land called Honah Lee
,Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
,and brought him strings and sealing wax
,and other fancy stuff
,Together they would travel
,on a boat with billowed sail
,Jackie kept a lookout
,perched on Puff's gigantic tail
,Noble kings and princes
,would bow whene'er they came
,Pirate ships would lower their flag
,when Puff roared out his name
,A dragon lives forever
,but not so little boys
,Painted wings and giant rings
,make way for other toys.
,One grey night it happened,
,Jackie Paper came no more
,And Puff that mighty dragon
,he ceased his fearless roar.
,His head was bent in sorrow
,green scales fell like rain
,Puff no longer went to play
,along the cherry lane
,Without his life-long friend
,Puff could not be brave
,So Puff that mighty dragon
,sadly slipped into his cave

Oh Danny boy
The pipes the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn
And down the mountain side
The summer's gone
And all the flowers are dyinging
'Tis you must go
And I must bye
But come ye back
When summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed
And white with snow
'Tis I'll be here
In Sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy
I love you so
Today while the blossoms still cling to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries
I'll drink your sweet wine
A million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joy that is mine today

I can't be contented with yesterday's glory
I can't live on promises winter to spring
Today is my moment and now is my story
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing
,Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree
,Stay ever green and young as the seasons go
,Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree
,Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow
,On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you
,Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true
,Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
,True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
,On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you
,Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true
,Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
,True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
,On the evergreen tree, on the evergreen tree.

,你在八十岁的某一天
,站在街头 牵着我
,我们提着满满的吃的
,看着来来往往的车
,我是快乐的悲观主义者
,你是理智的乐天派呢
,我们磕绊着吵闹着陪伴着
,就这样相爱着 很久了
,啦啦啦 啦啦啦啦
,啦啦啦 八十岁了
,啦啦啦 啦啦啦啦
,啦啦啦 很久了

,我坐在角落
,看霓虹闪烁
,这个城市一如既往的寂寞
,我知道 我的世界
,已经没有你了
,过了这么多年
,也应该忘了
,时常会软弱
,也总想洒脱
,我那迟迟不来的爱情
,你在哪儿啊
,有时候 张开怀抱
,你才知道自己有多脆弱
,开始习惯隐藏
,不再乱想
,不找了找不到的
,你还在想些什么
,这世界已经疯了
,你就别再自找折磨
,别找了找不到的
,上帝已如此忙碌
,该来她总会来的
,别找了
,时常会软弱
,也总想洒脱
,我那迟迟不来的爱情
,你在哪儿啊
,有时候 张开怀抱
,你才知道自己有多脆弱
,开始习惯隐藏
,不再乱想
,不找了找不到的
,你还在想些什么
,这世界已经疯了
,你就别再自找折磨
,别找了找不到的
,上帝已如此忙碌
,该来她总会来的
,别找了
,不找了找不到的
,你还在想些什么
,这世界已经疯了
,你却还在自找折磨
,别找了找不到的
,上帝已如此忙碌
,该来她总会来的
,别找了
,不找了找不到的
,他们在想些什么
,该来她总会来的
,别找了

,我是森林中的布谷鸟
,家住在美丽的半山腰
,看太阳落下去又回来 世界太多美妙
,蝴蝶跳着动人的舞蹈
,她的秘密没有人知道
,美丽的白云悄悄哭泣 那是雨水的味道
,清晨的阳光照大地
,美丽的天空还有多高
,布谷鸟 在声声叫
,唱着动人的歌谣
,歌声唱给那那悲伤地人 把一切都忘掉
,要飞到天涯海角
,我是勇敢的小鸟
,哪里有永恒的微笑
,给我温暖的怀抱
,布谷鸟-安子与九妹
,春天过去居然是夏天
,夏天过去原来是秋天
,秋天过去就算是冬天
,从来没有烦恼
,没有花香也没有树高
,也没有迷人的外表
,但我会陪你直到老
,什么也不会计较
,生命的转换在一瞬间
,希望的呼喊在天边
,布谷鸟 在声声叫
,唱着动人的歌谣
,歌声唱给那悲伤的人
,把一切都忘掉
,要飞到天涯海角

,恋恋风尘
,那天黄昏
,开始飘起了白雪
,忧伤开满山冈
,等青春散场
,午夜的电影
,写满古老的恋情
,在黑暗中为年轻歌唱
,走吧女孩
,去看红色的朝霞
,带上我的恋歌
,你迎风吟唱
,露水挂在发梢
,结满透明的惆怅
,是我一生最初的迷惘
,当岁月和美丽已成风尘中的叹息
,你感伤的眼里有旧时泪滴
,相信爱的年纪
,没能唱给你的歌曲
,让我一生常常追忆

,我抬眼是千佛山的轮廓
,我闭眼是大明湖和护城河
,趵突泉在我耳畔喷涌着
,可我却不清楚
,济南
,到底是啥样的
,它究竟是啥样的
,穿旗袍的姑娘你在哪儿呢
,说快板儿的大爷你在哪儿呢
,膈应人的小么都长大了
,半青的乡音有谁还会记得
,那古街古巷都已经被拆了
,民国的火车站我都未见过
,青石板的泉水早已没了着落
,户户垂杨的美景已成为传说
,济南呐济南呐 你在哪儿呢
,济南呐济南呐 我离家太远了
,济南呐济南呐 我回不去了
,济南呐济南呐 我想你了
,古城的大西边儿有黄河流过
,东南北那三边儿有山川包围着
,内蒙古的风沙它长驱直入呢
,泉水仍滋润着城市的脉络
,雄伟的城墙只剩个解放阁
,霓虹灯的光照不亮护城河
,燕喜堂的牌匾昏暗又没落
,芙蓉街的店家 有几个是鲁菜呢
,济南呐济南呐 你的根在哪儿呢
,济南呐济南呐 你还剩下什么啊
,济南呐济南呐 你知道吗
,济南呐济南呐 我有多爱你呢
,我抬眼是千佛山的轮廓
,我闭眼是大明湖和护城河
,趵突泉在我耳畔喷涌着
,我只想对你说
,济南
,我想你了
,我想回家了

,饮酌那秋黄
,不吁然

,Four year's old my birthday
,I opened presents, ate some cake
,I took my tank straight outside to play
,In dirt
,Six years old, hard line drive
,That ball just sailed on by
,Cause I was busy writing that name of mine
,In dirt
,It was my first love
,Good as gold
,Heaven was a shovel and a two foot hole
,Mama should have bought all my clothes in brown
,Cause I'd turn em that color anyhow
,Even between the car and the front steps of that church
,Was dirt
,Turned sixteen bought a Chevrolet
,Four wheel drive, what a happy day
,So even if it rained
,I could play
,In dirt
,Couple years later, wouldn't you know
,I lost my heart at the rodeo
,She fell off her horse and was covered head to toe in dirt
,It was my first love
,Good as gold
,Heaven was a shovel and a two foot hole
,It's the reason I'm out here tilling this land
,And that rodeo queen's got a ring on her hand
,I don't know where I'd be
,if it weren't for dirt
,I ain't afraid of growing old
,Cause when I die
,I know where I'll go
,There'll be no need to cry for me
,I won't need your sympathy
,When they cover me up with six feet of earth
,It's just dirt
,
,
,
,
,
,I love the way you twirl your hair
,Those overalls and flip flops you wear
,The way you'd smile waiting in your drive
,Hot Sunday afternoons
,You didn't mind my rusty truck
,Swinging by to pick you up
,I missed your sweet face, it was six long days
,Since I'd got to hang with you
,And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
,Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
,Sing to brown eyed girl
,My guitar in the barn bridge shade
,I'd number your freckles
,And the times your fishing line tangled
,And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
,No, it ain't hard to remember those good old lazy days
,And we'd stop by Ernie's General store
,Got two maple walnut ice cream cones
,Funny how they always seem to get on your nose
,Yeah, when you'd ride with me
,I'd cuss the moon tryin' to get you back
,Ground all the gears while you just laughed
,'Cause it was twelve o'clock, porch lights turned off
,Yeah, and I was up the creek
,And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
,Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
,Sing to brown eyed girl
,My guitar in the barn bridge shade
,I'd number your freckles
,And the times your fishing line tangled
,And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
,No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days
,Ain't it funny how we never could sell that old pick up of mine
,Baby grab the keys, I'll get the jumper cables 'cause it's about time
,And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
,Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
,Sing to brown eyed girl
,My guitar in the barn bridge shade
,I'd number your freckles
,And the times your fishing line gets tangled
,And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
,No, it ain't hard to remember
,baby do you remember
,I think it's time we remember those good lazy days
,I've heard scientists
,Get confused when you ask them to define it
,Cause its a miracle
,It keeps the universe we see from ever dying
,And the stars from falling
,Though we cant see it
,It must true
,And its the only thing ive found, to compare our love to
,
,Its invisible
,You cant touch it
,No matter where you go on earth u cant outrun it
,It only exists to pull you in
,Till your where your meant to be
,Girl our love is a lot like gravity
,
,Its a phenominal
,How i can hunger for ur touch and need ur company
,And its just beautiful

,Just like me
,Someday we will meet

,In an orchard, by a barn
,Listen to some late night radio
,Watch the satellites and stars
,And I will hold you in my arms
,Till we both fall asleep
,Underneath the apple trees
,Will I meet you on a bus?
,Or a narrow street cafe?
,Find you in a sunday market
,Or a lonely park bench in the shade?
,Do you like you coffee strong?
,Do you sleep in when it rains?
,All those little things about you girl
,I can't wait to learn someday
,You know I'm on my way
,And we'll park neath the apple trees
,In an orchard, by a barn
,Listen to some late night radio
,Watch the satellites and stars
,And I will hold you in my arms
,Till we both fall asleep
,Underneath the apple trees, yeah
,When I was just a boy
,I'd run barefoot beneath those leaves
,Throwing rotten apples
,Building forts,rake the leaves
,I guess I never grew up
,Cause I still believe in love
,And that that day will come
,And we'll park neath the apple trees
,In an orchard, by a barn
,Listen to some late night radio
,Watch the satelites and stars
,And I will hold you in my arms
,Till we both fall asleep
,Underneath the apple trees
,Underneath the apple trees
There's a place in town where we all hang out 
Where the country girls go and the boys get loud when the whistle blows we make quite the crowd 
When the sun sets low on 
Friday From the pubs in 
Ireland to 
Tennessee 
From the west coast down to myrtle beach 
Oh And every little town here in between 
Yeah, We know how to party on 
Friday And the band plays on and the taps they flow 
The boss man's yelling but we've all gone home 
A come a Monday morning 
I will atone 
But tonight ain't 
Monday it's 
Friday Well 
I like my job but 
I love my friends 
So you know where 
I'll be when the work week ends 
At the little country tavern just around the bend 
When the sun sets low on 
Friday And the band plays on and the taps they flow 
The boss man's yelling but we've all gone home 
A come a Monday morning 
I will atone 
But tonight ain't 
Monday it's 
Friday
He was selling dirt worms out in the summer sun
And she came by on her pedal bike
And she said "What you doin' boy?" with her cheeks full of bubblegum
And sat down on his apple box and smiled
She said "I'm missing one front tooth, but I could be some company"
So they spent that summer diggin' holes down by the stream
She'd say "You're my best friend. The first one I ever had."
He'd just smiled and said "I love you." without a word
He'd put some flowers in her hands
As they sat there in the sand
On the bank of the river
Well, he was never good at sayin' what was on his heart
And those three words never came out
And she grew up and fell in love with his quiet charm
And if it hurt her she didn't tell
Cause he knew how to say I love you in every other way
He tried his best to show it on their wedding day
When she said
"You're my best friend. The first one I ever had"
He'd just smiled and said "I love you." without a word
He'd put some flowers in her hands
As they stood there in the sand
On the bank of the river
They had years of life
And their cup overflowed
It came time for him to walk some of them alone
And he said
"You were my best friend. The only one I really had.
Oh how I wish you could have heard me say those words."
And he put some flowers in her hands
As he layed her in the sand
And cried that he loved her
On his knees
By the river

Fishin poles leanin' on the tailgate 
Bbq brickets a startin to glow 
Cabin light reflectin off a quiet lake 
Nothin more romantic than campfire smoke 
Haven't seen you much this past week girl 
You go your way and 
I go my mine 
Pass u on the porch, we're from two different worlds 
But this weekend we're gonna make it right , 
We'll heat some rocks till they're red hot 
I'll throw 'em in a water trough 
Make a hot tub 
The rocky mountain kind 
Yeah it's time we took a rest 
We've got a love to protect 
So nothin' comes between you and 
I Let's share a sleepin' bag tonight 
We used hang out in that row boat 
Sure glad we brought it out tonight 
Lets hope that old girl, she still floats 
So I can catch us a couple big fish to fry 
Your as pretty as a picture in them gum boots 
Sand in your hair, mud on your cheeks 
I miss times like this, when 
I could hang out with you 
When love was young and time was free ,
I was living in a world without color 
Like an old photograph 
Flying down the road never looked 
At what I might have passed 
But when I met you, girl 
I just had to slow down 
You were beautiful but different 
You turned this ol' boy around 
You're a wildflower 
You caught my eye at the side of the road 
You're a wildflower 
Girl, that's what makes you so beautiful 
I love how your pretty shy smile 
Can light up a room 
The way that you talk, share your secrets 
How your body moves 
You got a way about you 
That stands out in a crowd 
What you think are imperfections 
Are what I couldn't live without 
You're a wildflower 
You caught my eye at the side of the road 
You're a wildflower 
Girl, that's what makes you so beautiful, yeah, oh 
I used to wonder 
If love was out there somewhere 
With all the millions of people 
It was you 
I saw there '
Cause you're a wildflower 
You caught my eye at the side of the road 
You're a wildflower 
Girl, that's what makes you so beautiful
I was watchin’ cartoons on a Saturday morning
And I heard daddy start the truck
I came runnin’ from the house and waved him down
Cause he was makin’ a run to the dump
We watched the Bears and licked ice cream cones
Take a little walk around
I’ll never forget what my daddy said
The day we pulled that bike from the ground
He said one man’s trash is another man’s gold
If it’s thrown away it’s free to take
A little oil she’ll be good to go
So I rode that bicycle home
Thumbs up, daddy honkin’ on the horn
I got my first job workin’ on a dairy farm
Drivin’ tractor and bailin’ hay
I’d have to circle around a bog in the ground
Where sat an old Mustang ‘58
One evenin’ I asked that farmer
Why that car was just wastin’ away
He said you can have it for free it don’t mean nothin’ to me
And I couldn’t help but think
One man’s trash is another man’s gold
What someone will throw away is a crying shame
So I towed that Mustang home
Till she could be restored
I got that engine to roar
And boy did that engine roar
It was an awkward blind date we met at a park
She had her little girl taggin’ along
A beautiful smile hadn’t been out in a while
She was a hard working single mom
In time I learned he’d left her
He said “I’m just way too young
To be having a kid, I’m not ready for this
If you keep it I’m good as gone”
He never looked back as she watched him go
She stood there crying in the rain till one January day
She had a beautiful baby girl
Tonight I tuck her in and read her stories
And hold her mama while the sunset glows
My two arms full of this man’s gold
What some men will throw away is a crying shame
Those girls make our house a home
Yeah my cup overflows
With this man’s gold
This man’s gold

Everybody needs some sun sometimes 
A little Sunday drive 
To light up their world of grey 
So come on darlin' hop up in my truck 
Lets take her for a run 
Till we feel a little change , 
We'll find a 
Coke machine 
Roadside motel for gasoline 
I'll check the oil while you laugh at me 
I get crazy cause 
I love to see you smile 
What you do to me 
Is still what you did at seventeen 
We made all of those memories 
On a country road back in time 
On a good ol' fashioned 
Sunday drive 
Surfin' heat waves 
We'll find that rusted sign 
On highway 55 
Broken asphalt and a dead end ghost town drive in 
Parked beneath the burned out light 
Take a hammer and some ice 
And I'll make you snow cones on my truck bed , 
We'll find a 
Coke machine 
Roadside motel for gasoline 
I'll check the oil while you laugh at me 
I get crazy cause 
I love to see you smile 
What you do to me 
Is still what you did at seventeen 
We made all of those memories

She grew up watching hockey 
With her daddy on 
Saturday nights 
He taught her how to tie her skates 
Her brothers taught her how to fight 
She can wear high heels or flannel 
She can look sexy in a toque 
She likes snow storms and 
Gordon Lightfoot 
And if you're lucky she'll love you

My baby she likes to snowboard 
And spend her summers out on a boat 
Thinks the perfect night out is a cabin 
Smell of coffee on an old wood-stove 
She won't admit, but she watched 
Degrassi She's proud and sometimes quiet 
A true north national treasure. 
She'd give her life for the red and white

I'm from a little country town where the sky is blue 
Friday nights around here ain't a whole lot to do 
So I went and called up sweet 
Becky Lou 
Said how'd you like to go for a drive? 
I took her in my truck to the railroad tracks 
Lit a cozy fire for a little romance 
I sang her a song and she reached for my hand 
When daddy busted outta the woods 
He said , 
Stop it right there! hands in the air 
We think there's somethin you kids ought to know 
Ya scared your momma half to death, we've been searchin the sticks 
Tryin to find you and dang that was close 
Her daddy's older nephew might be twice removed 
But she's the daughter of an uncle related to you 
You might not wanna go swimmin in the same gene pool 
Don't be touchin that's your cousin 
I turned around to look at becky and she looked at me 
We broke the law of attraction almost instantly 
Her pretty brown hair went to ugly and green 
And she gave me my coat back 
So we packed it in but the night was young 
She said if you don't mind id still like to have fun 
There's a show called deliverance on rerun 
Down at the cinema , 
Stop it right there! hands in the air 
We think there's somethin you kids ought to know 
Ya scared your momma half to death, we've been searchin the sticks 
Tryin to find you and dang that was close 
Her daddy's older nephew might be twice removed 
But shes the daughter of an uncle related to you 
We need a little separation in our gene pool 
Don't be touchin that's your cousin , 
Well I ran into becky just the other day 
At the new online internet cafe 
She was lookin for a man from the ukraine 
On eharmony
It was one lane in and one lane out 
A country road they built around 
A general store and last stop for gasoline 
A paved carpet where we rode our bikes 
How the mail came in and how our town survived 
A hundred miles from the city's cold concrete 
Yeah round here old rural route number three 
Is more than just a crossing for tumbleweeds , 
She's taken sons to foreign shores 
Brought some back home to their front porch 
She' how we come together when the church bell rings 
A quarter inch on a fold out map 
Where we live, love, cry and laugh 
I hope my kids can grow up just like me 
On a country road like rural route number three 
My first memory is wrapped around 
Momma walkin' me to my first bus route 
She thought 
I didn't notice but saw her cry 
A place we parked and fogged windows 
A way to college and 
Christmas back home 
The shoulder 
I broke down on when a good friend died , 
The sun is hot, our flag it waves 
We've dreamed for years about this day 
When we'd take those five yellow ribbons down 
Riding the blacktops hot heatwaves 
Black boots marchin' through ticker tape 
A boy from overseas came back to town 
Today old highway three is hallowed ground ,
Sittin' in the bed of my truck 
Barefoot and cuddled up 
Sippin' sweet tea in the settin' sun 
It's so hot outside, her hair's untied and all undone 
Johnson Hill overlooks the fence 
To the only drive-in, left from here to 
Lincoln county 
A little statics alright with us 
Yeah, it's 
Friday night, how we unwind and get all undone 
Tune our dial to 1650 
A Coleman lantern and hot dogs grillin' 
Ain't no one up here but a few bull frogs 
Yeah, our idea of getting crazy has a lot 
To do with just getting lazy 
On a patch quilted blanket 
We'll put the brakes on the rush 
Yeah, it's 
Friday at night time 
To unwind and get all undone 
Fog settin' in, the air is so thick 
Nights like these it's good to be wet 
So we might go dippin' in 
Miller's pond 
Yes, we might turn the headlights off 
Leave the radio on and get all undone 
Tune our dial to 1650 
A Coleman lantern and hot dogs grillin' 
Ain't no one up here but a few bull frogs 
Yeah, our idea of getting crazy has a lot 
To do with just getting lazy 
On a patch quilted blanket 
We'll put the brakes on the rush 
Yeah, it's 
Friday at night time 
To unwind and get all undone 
Yeah, it's 
Friday night 
Time to unwind and get all undone
He rode into town one dust storm, 
Sheepskin cloak across his back. 
A preacher man with kind old eyes, 
And a mystery for a past. 
He said he'd come to teach about the love of 
God, But he soon learned what they were missing there 
Was justice and the law. 
There was a cattleman who claimed his clan owned all the land around. 
And any brave fool who that might dispute, 
He was quick to snuff 'em out. 
He'd say, "Take my heed and you won't pay the price. 'Cause honor and a name ain't worth a damn if you don't have your life." 
He'd say, "Ain't nobody faster than this cattle man's gun. I'm a rattlesnake on the trigger. Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand, Fallin' to the slam of my hammer." 
So one man taught forgiveness, 
While the other taught suffering. 
The preacher said deliverance, 
Could be found out on their knees. 
He said, "I know that you want justice And you want blood, But believe me when I say to you, Don't try and be that man's judge. 'Cause ain't nobody faster than that cattleman's gun, He's a rattlesnake on the trigger, Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand, Fallin' to the slam of his hammer." 
One day a young farmer brought his sons to town for feed. 
And he noticed that the streets were quiet, and he knew what that might mean. 
The smoke rose in the distance, 
His farm burned to the ground. 
He let the fury overtake him, 
When Cattle 
Man came back to town. 
Those boys ran out from behind the crowd, 
And watched their daddy die, 
The big man laughed and said, "Now look at that. Anybody else wanna give it a try?" 
Well, the church doors opened with that black cloak flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes. 
He said, "Your ticket to Hell is a comin' to you, And I got a hollow-point to give you the ride." 
And the only thing faster than the cattle man's gun, 
Was the preacher's handy finger, 
He pulled iron from his side and let that bullet fly, 
Beat the rattlesnake to the hammer. 
While the preacher embraced forgiveness, 
Oh, they finally understood, 
Under that sheepskin cloak of his, 
Was a history of blood.
The road was cold the fog was heavy 
Her headlights were just like a ghost 
She said you look innocent but 
I ain't crazy 
I'm just too tired to drive on alone 
If you don't want me to shoot ya 
You'll keep both hands on that wheel 
She was sweet with just enough poison 
I wasn't sure just what to feel , 
So I drove her into a sunrise 
In the middle of nowhere 
USA And she slept peaceful as a baby 
Once she put that .45 away 
When she woke up we talked bout livin 
Where she was goin, where 
I had been 
I lit a smoke she talked bout 
Jesus How he had power to raise the dead 
We watched falling stars from her truckbed , 
And we parked neath the burnin sunrise 
And I held her against my chest 
She said I never would have shot ya 
I said I know, your gun it had no lead.
The house was like a tomb. 
I was hiding in my room. 
As my brother made his way on down the hall. 
I didn't want to say goodbye. 
And I was trying to deny there was a war, 
And that he got the call. 
I watched him from my window 
Walking down the drive. 
Then I ran down the stairway 
Through the front door and 
I cried You come back you hear? 
And I let him see my tears 
I said I'll give you my rookie of 
DiMaggio. 
I'll do anything you want, 
Clean your room, or wash your car. 
I'll do anything so long as you don't go. 
But he said, this is what brothers are for. 
Well I have my heroes, 
But the one 
I love the most 
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat. 
And I wrote him every night, 
I said I miss our pillow fights, 
But lately 
I just wonder where you're at. 
Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live. 
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give. 
I said you come back you hear? 
I miss you being near. 
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove 
I'll do anything you want. 
There must be someone 
I can call, 
And just maybe they would let you come back home. 
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for. 
I may never have to face the anger of those guns, 
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood, 
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost 
For him to love me that much. 
Well, it had been two years, 
And I held back my tears 
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore. 
And as I ran and held him tight, 
That's when he looked me in the eye 
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home. 
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.

,Sweetest I'm gambling every try
,I'm struggling in the half light
,To be on my best behavior these days
,All this changing's got a name and I don't claim to know it
,The Danish house is on its way down the ocean anytime now
,In the day I surely must've had much more to say
,Than waking up and waiting to go
,In the blink of an eye
,Fall asleep wishing I could have this on repeat
,Was it out of my hands
,Over again
,Slowly you're saying some kind of sorry
,But it's sounding more like you're letting me know
,I'm not afraid to be the one to leave and then letting you go
,Why give some kind of story
,When you know it's only gon' be nothing at all
,Give it over little lover you know I'll be another to call
,Another to call
,Another to call
,My shivering spite
,Is no match for the crumbling catch
,To see me, believe me
,I can be such a liar sometimes it's just a triumph to know how right
,You can be so right
,I'd drop every fight
,I have no right
,And if I stayed easily involved in your dismay
,Then maybe I just wouldn't have known
,That little more in your lies
,Slowly you're saying some kind of sorry
,But it's sounding more like you're letting me know
,I'm not afraid to be the one to leave and then letting you go
,Why give some kind of story
,When you know it's only gon' be nothing at all
,Give it over little lover you know I'll be another to call
,Another to call
,Another to call
,Another to call
,Another to call
,Didn’t think I’d finally find
,A whole world in my mind
,But you’re doing just fine
,You said, “I’m sorry babe
,I just want to shine
,Hey
,Shine
,Hey
,Tall grass and a blistering heat
,I’ve got the burns on my back
,Dirt on the soles of my feet
,They say, “Come here where the air is sweet
,Play the game we’re playing
,I heard them saying
,Here’s where you lose your mind
,The water here’s divine
,You’re doing just fine
,Come on darling
,Don’t you want to shine
,Don’t you want to shine

,She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
,She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
,Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
,She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
,She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as a shotgun
,Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
,Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,With my pretty little Galway Girl
,You're my pretty little Galway Girl
,You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
,And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
,As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
,After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
,I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
,Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
,Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
,And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,My pretty little Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,
,Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
,I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
,Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
,As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
,I walked her home then she took me inside
,Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
,I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
,About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
,She played the fiddle in an Irish band
,But she fell in love with an English man
,Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
,Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
,My pretty little Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
,My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

,I know you say you know me, know me well
,But these days I don't even know myself, no
,I always thought I'd be with someone else
,I thought I would own the way I felt, yeah
,I call you but you never even answer
,I tell myself I'm done with wicked games
,But then I get so numb with all the laughter
,That I forget about the pain
,Whoah, you stress me out, you kill me
,You drag me down, you fuck me up
,We're on the ground, we're screaming
,I don't know how to make it stop
,I love it, I hate it, and I can't take it
,But I keep on coming back to you
,I know my friends they give me bad advice
,Like move on, get you out my mind
,But don't you think I haven't even tried
,You got me cornered and my hands are tied
,You got me so addicted to the drama

,And I guess you'll never know
,All the bullshit that you put me through
,And I guess you'll never know, no
,Yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
,You can be the pill to ease the pain
,'Cause I know I'm addicted to your drama
,Baby, here we go again

,
,我会找到我的宝贝紧紧的抱住她
,抓住这个愉悦的午后时光
,我的座右铭一直是合适的是最好的
,为什么要等到漆黑冰冷的午夜
,白天如此明亮
,夜晚总会降临
,你唤醒了我深沉的欲望
,盼望着那一点点午后的喜悦
,两块坚石擦出耀眼的火花
,一想到你也是爱我的我就无比兴奋
,如火箭冲出天空
,午后的喜悦
,下午的喜悦
,今早开始我变得如此温文有礼2
,我总是在想鱼儿不想被抓住就不能总是到处咬啊咬的
,但你有能让我上钩的鱼饵
,一点点午后的喜悦
,如火箭冲出天空
,下午的喜悦
,下午的喜悦
,亲爱的请等我回来
,黄昏之后尽情地翻云覆雨

,下午的喜悦
,Not very often have we met
,But the music's been too bad
,Can only sense happiness
,if the music is sad
,So I'm going home
,I must hurry home
,Where a life goes on
,We're too old to make a mess
,Dreams will keep me young
,Old enough to stress
,Only mirrors tell the time
,So I'm going home
,I must hurry home
,So will my life go on
,Yes I'm going home
,Going home alone
,And your life goes on
,So I'm going home
,I must hurry home
,So will my life go on
,Yes I'm going home
,Going home alone
,And your life goes on

Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home; 
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, 
Which seek thro' the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere. 
I gaze on the moon 
As I tread the drear wild, 
And feel that my mother 
Now thinks of her child; 
As she looks at that moon 
From our own cottage door, 
Thro' the woodbine whose fragrance 
Shall cheer me no more. 
(Music)
As she looks at that moon 
From our own cottage door, 
Thro' the woodbine whose fragrance 
Shall cheer me no more. 
Home, home, sweet sweet home, 
Be it ever so humble, 
There's no place like home.

,Hello darkness, my old friend
,I've come to talk with you again
,Because a vision softly creeping
,Left its seeds while I was sleeping
,And the vision that was planted in my brain
,Still remains
,Within the sound of silence
,In restless dreams I walked alone
,Narrow streets of cobblestone
,'Neath the halo of a street lamp
,I turned my collar to the cold and damp
,When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
,That split the night
,And touched the sound of silence
,
,And in the naked light I saw
,Ten thousand people, maybe more
,People talking without speaking
,People hearing without listening
,People writing songs that voices never share
,And no one dare
,Disturb the sound of silence
,
,"Fools" said I, "You do not know
,Silence like a cancer grows
,Hear my words that I might teach you
,Take my arms that I might reach to you"
,But my words like silent raindrops fell
,And echoed in the wells of silence
,
,Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..
,Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..
,Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmm..Hmm..Hmm..
,Hmmm..Hmmm..Hmmm..

,Oh no, lady, he's not here.

,I'll come to you, I'll come to you
,I'll come, come, come
,The power of youth
,Is on my mind
,Sunset, small town
,All out of time
,Will you still love me when I shine?
,From words but not from beauty
,My father's love
,Was always strong
,My mother's glamour
,Lives on and on
,Yet still inside I felt alone
,For reasons unknown to me
,but if you'd send for me
,You know I'll come
,And if you'd call for me
,You know I'll run
,I'll run to you, I'll run to you
,I'll run, run, run
,I'll come to you,
,I'll come to you
,I'll come, come, come
,And if you call I'll run, run, run
,If you change your mind
,I'll come, come, come
,Blue hydrangea
,Cold cash, Divine
,Cashmire, Cologne
,And hot sunshine
,Red racing cars
,Sunset and vine
,And we were young and pretty
,Midnight, you come and pick me up
,No headlight
,Long drive
,But ending burn in flames or paradise
,Fading off you
,it's been a while since I have even heard from you
,I should just tell you to leave cause I
,Know exactly where it leads but I
,Watch us go round and round each time
,You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
,And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,So it goes
,He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
,Takes me home
,Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
,I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
,Some other girl
,He says, what you've heard it's true but I
,Can't stop thinking about you and I
,I said I've been there a few times
,Cause You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
,And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,Take me home
,Just take me home
,Just take me home
,You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style

,No I can't forget this evening
,Or your face as you were leaving
,But I guess that's just the way
,The story goes
,
,You always smile but in your eyes
,You sorrow shows
,Yes it shows
,
,No I can't forget tomorrow
,When I think of all my sorrow
,When I had you there
,But then I let you go
,
,And now it's only fair
,That I should let you know
,What you should know

,I don't know where I'm at
,I'm standing at the back
,And I'm tired this waiting
,Waiting here in life
,Hoping that I'll find
,What I've been chasing
,
,I shot for the sky
,I'm stuck on the ground
,So why do I try
,I know I'm gonna fall down
,I thought I could fly
,So why did I drown
,Never know why
,It's coming down, down, down
,
,I'm not ready to let go
,'Cause then I'd never know
,What I could be missing
,But I'm missing way too much

,It's coming down, down, down
,
,Oh I'm going down, down, down
,I can't find another way around
,And I don't wanna hear that sound
,Of losing what I never found
,
,I shot for the sky
,I'm stuck on the ground

,We can fight our desires
,But when we start making fires
,We get ever so hot
,Whether we like it or not.
,They say we can love who we trust
,But what is love without lust
,Two hearts with accurate devotions
,What are feelings without emotions.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I hang my hopes out on the line
,Will they be ready for you in time
,If you leave them out too long
,Will they be withered by the sun
,Full stops and exclamation marks
,My words stumble before I start.
,How far can you bend emotion?
,Can this bridge cross the ocean?
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill
,I’m hoping you’ll understand
,Now let go of my hand.
,I’m going in for the kill
,I’m doing it for a thrill

,Don’t let go of my hand.

,I wanna be on the front line, knotted up suit ties
,Talking like a headstrong mamma
,Got a picture in your wallet
,Making me a habit, wearing your vintage t-shirt
,Tied ribbons on your top pad
,Telling me I'm all that, just like the girls from your hometown
,Sweet blooded and up-stranded, see if I can stand it, shrinking in the shallow water
,Magnetic everything about you
,You really got me, now
,You did to me so well
,Hypnotic taking over me
,Make me feel like someone else
,You got me talking in my sleep
,I don't wanna come back down
,I don't wanna touch the ground
,Pacific Ocean dug so deep
,Hypnotic taking over me
,White threads on my laces
,Stuck on the hinges, swinging the door to the back yard
,Cut splinters, walk a tightrope
,Spun like a bandage touch on the outer surface
,Bright eyes of the solstice wherever your mind is headed for a freight train city
,Locked up till you're moon lit
,Brushing my hair back, feeling your lips on my cold neck
,Magnetic everything about you
,You really got me, now
,You took to me so well
,Hypnotic taking over me
,Make me feel like someone else
,You got me talking in my sleep

,I think the universe is on my side
,Heaven and Earth have finally aligned

,If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
,I hope you're on it
,If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
,I hope you caught it
,
,Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
,So catch a ride, catch a cab
,Don't you know I miss you bad
,But don't you walk to me
,
,Baby run, cut a path across the blue skies
,Straight in a straight line
,You can't get here fast enough
,
,Find a truck and fire it up
,Lean on the gas and off the clutch
,Leave Dallas in the dust
,I need you in a rush
,So baby run
,So baby run
,
,If you ain't got a suit case
,Get a box or an old brown paper sack
,And pack it light or pack it heavy
,Take a truck, take a Chevy
,Baby just come back
,
,There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
,Why don't you take it
,Don't let that speed limit slow you down
,Go on and break it
,Baby break it
,And run, cut a path across the blue skies
,Straight in a straight line
,You can't get here fast enough
,Find a truck and fire it up

,I used to rule the world
,Seas would rise when I gave the word
,Now in the morning I sleep alone
,Sweep the streets I used to own
,I used to roll the dice
,Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
,Listen as the crowd would sing
,“Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!”
,One minute I held the keys
,Next the doors were closed on me
,And I discovered that my castles stand
,Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror, my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,Once you go there was never
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,It was a wicked and wild wind
,Blew down the doors to let me in
,Shattered windows and the sound of drums
,People couldn't believe what I'd become
,Revolutionaries wait
,For my head on a silver plate
,Just a puppet on a lonely string
,Oh who would ever wanna be king?
,I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
,Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
,Be my mirror, my sword and shield
,My missionaries in a foreign field
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world
,For some reason I can't explain
,I know Saint Peter won't call my name
,Never an honest word
,But that was when I ruled the world

,You said the way my blue eyes shined,
,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
,I said: "That's a lie"
,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
,On backroads at night
,An' I was right there beside him all summer long
,An' then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone
,But when you think: Tim McGraw,
,I hope you think my favorite song
,The one we danced to all night long:
,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
,When you think happiness,
,I hope you think: "That little black dress"
,Think of my head on your chest,
,An' my old faded blue jeans
,When you think Tim McGraw,
,I hope you think of me
,September saw a month of tears,
,An' thankin' God that you weren't here,
,To see me like that
,But in a box beneath my bed,
,Is a letter that you never read,
,From three summers back
,It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,
,An' lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe:
,When you think: Tim McGraw,
,I hope you think my favorite song

,I hope you think of me
,
,And I'm back for the first time since then:
,I'm standin' on your street,
,An' there's a letter left on your doorstep,
,An' the first thing that you'll read:
,Is: "When you think: Tim McGraw,
,"I hope you think my favorite song"
,Some day you'll turn your radio on,
,I hope it takes you back to that place

,of every vain and wealthy brother in a February field
,and cattle and steed from wherever there is need
,and it's measured in love
,held together till the ceremony came
,and everyone waited still
,everyone waited still
,deck the halls with the wealthy of mine
,some say England had a queen
,who was married to a dreamer
,who was going insane
,and held together by a battle
,and a reel of forty two pages
,sealed in a weather tight drum
,it was leather it was guns that would hold it inside
,all together till the ceremony came
,everyone waited still
,everyone waited still

,Oh, no, but not today
,Say, say, oh, playmate I cannot play with you

,
,Have come and gone all along
,
,I heard this song inside me
,
,To wait I was told
,
,But now I've found

,I hear when your around me
,
,It's something new, because of you
,
,I hope I hear it forever

,My my love

,
,To anyone, but then you came along
,
,When first I laid eyes upon your face
,
,this song replaced all the others
,I had written
,
,It's all brand new because of you
,
,Feels like I've known you forever

,It was an ordinary day
,I woke up on a wave
,I filled a sail
,And made my way to the shore
,I blew through the center of your town
,Came upon your house through your window
,and I came through your screen door
,I asked you
,Can you hear me blow?
,Though you don’t know
,Where I’m coming from
,Or where I go?
,It was an ordinary night
,I met some fireflies
,I danced around with them
,Until about 9 o’clock
,Heard your footsteps on the road
,I ran to bring you home
,And I whispered through the leaves
,Up and down your block
,Oh I’m a summer breeze
,I brush across your cheek
,I have always been
,And I will always be
,You can hear me blow
,Although you don’t know
,Where I’m comin from
,Or where I go
,It’s me when you catch the fragrance
,of spring
,When tall trees sway
,It’s me in the cold winter sting
,In the alleyway
,I am the sigh
,While all creation groans and waits
,You can hear me speak
,If you’re listenin
,I will always be
,And I have always been
,You can hear me blowin
,Although you don’t know
,Where I’m comin from
,Or where I go

,went back home to play your songs
,and I stayed out west close to waves
,Now count the days
,and I hope that someday
,we can move in the same place to live our way
,I'll count the days to see your face
,You are my favorite song
,you are my favorite song

,just give me time to open up
,and keep it safe.

,Cross the footnotes of self sacrifice
,Some place, somewhere there are bluer skies
,My lover lies under
,Pass the battle hymns of late night bars
,Through the endless lines of motor cars
,There's a quiet night of quiet stars
,My lover lies under
,I do believe I've lost my faith in Hollywood
,Those dreams upon the screen aint for the likes of us
,But I swear somewhere there is a heart that I could love
,But sometimes I wonder...
,Passing the warring tongues and prying eyes
,Through the subways and the city lights
,Some place somewhere there are bluer skies
,My lover lies under
,I do believe I've lost my faith in Hollywood
,Those dreams upon the screen aint for the likes of us
,But I swear somewhere there is a heart that I could love

,Cross the factory floors and the severed ties
,There's a sunset in our paradise
,That my lover lies under

,Well she's a girl ain't she
,Is she on your mind
,Every other thought
,Is there nothing you wouldn't do for her just because
,Does she hold your heart
,In her hands
,Did she walk into you life
,And change your plans
,Does she have her momma's big bright eyes
,Did you ever think something so small could change your life
,She can melt your heart with a just a smile can't she
,She's always gonna be her daddy's little baby
,She's a girl ain't she
,She's your girl,
,She's your girl
,I wanna drink that shot of whiskey
,I wanna smoke that cigarette

,I wanna wrap the moon around us
,and lay beside you skin on skin
,Make love til' the sun comes up
,and the sun goes down again
,cause i need you

,I was cleaning out the closet, throwin' things away
, I'd forgotten all about it, when I looked, there it lay
, I picked it up, found a frame and hung it in the hall
, But there's more behind this picture than the wall
,
, It was taken on that trip we took back in '92
, Casey sure didn't look like me, Lord, he looked like you
, We had no way of knowing then, just how the cards would fall
, Yeah, there's more behind this picture than the wall

, Lori moved to Hollywood, pre-tending she was grown
, You and I held on and tried, to make sense of it all
, There's more behind this picture than the wall

, Yeah, there's more behind this picture than the wall
,
, Casey died a hero, that's what the Chaplin said
, We couldn't find sweet glory, our doubt ain't over yet
, You and I still tortured by the memories we recall

,Late one night when the wind was still
,Daddy brought the baby to the window sill
,To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
,The one and only time Daddy saw it fly
,It came from the east just as bright as a torch
,The neighbors had a party on their porch
,Daddy rocked the baby, Mother said "amen"
,When Halley came to visit in nineteen ten
,Now back then Jackson was a real small town
,And it's not every night a comet comes around
,It was almost eighty years since its last time through
,So I bet your mother would've said "amen" too
,As its tail stretched out like a stardust streak
,The papers wrote about it every day for a week
,They wondered where it's going and where it's been
,When Halley came to Jackson in 1910
,Now Daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
,To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
,And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
,In nineteen eighty-six that wish came around
,It came from the east, just as bright as a torch
,She saw it in the sky from her daddy's porch
,As heavenly sent as it was back then
,When Halley came to Jackson in nineteen ten
,Late one night when the wind was still
作词 : Cain, Masters, Springer
I walked half way across this town
Singing in the pouring rain
I knew someway somehow
I had to see your smiling face
Some people need some time
Some people need their space
But when you're not in my arms
You're too far away (for)
Chorus
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to god above
And i've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
My friends all ask me why
I lay my heart on the line
But somewhere deep down inside
They know exactly why
When it don't go like you plan
There's nothing that hurts so bad
But when it works like it should
There's nothing on earth known to man (like)
Chorus
(tag)
I prayed to god above
And i've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
,Some dreams are big, some dreams are small
,Some dreams are carried away on the wind and never dreamed at all
,Some dreams tell lies, some dreams come true
,I've got a whole lot of dreams and I can dream for you
,If not for me, if not for you
,I'd be dreaming all day I wouldn't know what to do
,I'd hang around, I'd lose my way
,I'd put off what I couldn't do for another day
,Some dreams are big, some dreams are small
,Some dreams are carried away on the wind and never dreamed at all
,Some dreams tell lies, some dreams come true
,I've got a whole lot of dreams and I can dream for you
,I've spent my life hung up on dreams
,I float along like a summer cloud or so it seems
,I get it wrong most things I do
,But I can write a song and this one's for you
,Some dreams are big, some dreams are small
,Some dreams are carried away on the wind and never dreamed at all
,Some dreams tell lies, some dreams come true
,I've got a whole lot of dreams and I can dream for you
,Some call it fate, some call it chance
,Some call waiting around for someone to ask you to dance
,If I had my way, if I could call the tune
,You wouldn't have to wait 'cause I would dance you around the moon
,Some dreams are big, some dreams are small
,Some dreams are carried away on the wind and never dreamed at all
,Some dreams tell lies, some dreams come true
,I've got a whole lot of dreams and I can dream for you
,I've got a whole lot of dreams and I can dream for you

,Look at a picture of you on a horse
,With a bridle your father bought
,On a trip to Vermont in the fall
,Autumn is staring you down red and brown
,By the mane of a dying elm
,And the look on your face says it all.
,Four lean hounds in a row
,Where in the world did you go?
,Look at a picture of you, lucky lad
,In a jacket your father had
,When he fought in the war on TV
,Summer is wearing you down like a crown(?)
,Like the wind on a weathervane
,As you stand in the shade like a tree
,Four lean hounds in a row
,Where in the world did you go?
,Four lean hounds in a row
,Has anyone seen the king or the queen
,Did they look anything like you and me?
,Has anyone seen my king or my queen
,Did they look anything like you and me?
,Look at a picture of you in a crowd
,Where your memories are not allowed
,Just the weight of the light on the leaves.
,Four lean hounds in a row
,Where in the world did you go?
,Four lean hounds in a row.
,Tom's at the piano talkin' to a ghost
,Playin' with his eyes shut tight
,Here's a little song I learnt it from the wind
,I heard it on the wind last night
,Beats workin' in the field for a little blind boy
,Playin' in the dime museum
,Day the colonel came and he take ya by the hand
,What a lucky day for him
,When Tom is at the bench his hands are not his own
,Some spirit in the room takes hold
,Never seen the sun much less read a note
,But he makes ya wanna tap your toes
,Make your daddy proud oh make your daddy rich
,Some candy and cake for Tom
,Till the crowd dies down and the colonel's in the grave

,Remember when I was young and so were you
,And time stood still and love was all we knew
,You were the first, so was I
,We made love and then you cried
,Remember when
,
,Remember when we vowed the vows
,and walked the walk
,gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
,We lived and learned, life threw curves
,There was joy, there was hurt
,Remember when
,
,Remember when old ones died and new were born
,And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
,We came together, fell apart
,And broke each other's hearts
,Remember when
,
,Remember when the sound of little feet
,was the music
,We danced to week to week
,Brought back the love, we found trust
,Vowed we'd never give it up
,Remember when
,
,Remember when thirty seemed so old
,Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
,To where we are,
,where we've been
,Said we'd do it all again
,Remember when
,
,Remember when we said when we turned gray
,When the children grow up and move away
,We won't be sad, we'll be glad
,For all the life we've had

,I hope this old train breaks down
,Then I could take a walk around
,And, see what there is to see
,And time is just a melody
,All the people in the street
,Walk as fast as their feet can take them
,I just roll through town
,And though my windows got a view
,The frame im looking through
,Seems to have no concern for now
,So for now
,I need this here
,Old train to breakdown
,Oh please just
,Let me please breakdown
,This engine screams out loud
,Centipede gunna crawl westbound
,So I don't even make a sound
,Cause it's gunna sting me when I leave this town
,All the people in the street
,That i'll never get to meet
,If these tracks don't bend somehow
,And I got no time
,That I got to get to
,Where I don't need to be
,So I
,I need this
,Old train to breakdown
,Oh please just
,Let me please breakdown
,I wanna break on down
,But you cant stop nothing
,If you got no control
,Of the thoughts in your mind
,That you kept in, you know
,You don't know nothing
,But you don't need to know
,The wisdoms in the trees
,Not the glass windows
,You cant stop wishing
,If you don't let go
,But things that you find
,And you lose, and you know
,You keep on rolling
,Put the moment on hold
,The frames too bright
,So put the blinds down low
,I need this
,Old train to breakdown
,Oh please just
,Let me please breakdown
,I need this
,Old train to breakdown
,Oh please just
,Let me please breakdown
,Let me break down

,George Strait
,
,We loaded up my old station wagon
,With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
,Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
,Three days before we had to be back
,
,When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
,When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
,As we pulled up on that old dirt road
,He looked at me and swore
,
,Daddy, this could be the best day of my life
,I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
,Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
,I'm the luckiest boy alive
,This is the best day of my life
,
,His sixteenth birthday rolled around
,Classic cars were his thing
,When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
,I thought that boy would go in sane
,
,When you're in your teens
,Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
,You worked nights on end
,'Till it was new again
,And as he sat behind the wheel
,
,He said Dad
,This could be the best day of my life
,I've been dreaming day and night
,About the fun we've had
,Just me and you
,Doing what I've always wanted to
,I'm the luckiest boy alive
,This is the best day of my life
,
,Standing in a little room
,Back of the church with our tuxes on
,Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown
,
,He said Dad
,This could be the best day of my life
,I've been dreaming day and night
,Of being like you
,Now its me and her
,Watching you and mom I've learned
,I'm the luckiest man alive

,How many roads must a man walk down
,Before they call him a man
,How many seas must a white dove sail
,Before she sleeps in the sand
,How many times must the cannon balls fly
,Before they're forever banned
,The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
,The answer is blowing in the wind
,How many times must a man look up
,
,Before he can see the sky
,How many ears must one man have
,Before he can hear people cry
,How many deaths will it take
,'Till he knows that too many people have died
,The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind

,How many years must a mountain exist
,Before it is washed to the sea
,How many years can some people exist
,Before they're allowed to be free
,How many times can a man turn his head
,Pretending he just doesn't see?

,The answer is blowing in the wind

,Long stem things of beauty
,Created by the good Lord
,Cut down in the prime of their lives
,Boxed up, wrapped in paper
,Delivered to your front door
,Just to wind up in your garbage can outside

,Tell me how many flowers have to die
,Before you give this love another try
,I've asked you to forgive me at least 9 dozen times
,Tell me how many flowers have to die

,I had you and I blew it

,Well you only need the light when it's burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
,Only hate the road when you're missing home
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,And you let her go
,Staring at the bottom of your glass
,Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
,But dreams come slow and they go so fast
,You see her when you close your eyes
,Maybe one day you'll understand why
,Everything you touch surely dies
,But you only need the light when it's burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
,Only hate the road when you're missing home
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Staring at the ceiling in the dark
,Same old empty feeling in your heart
,Cos love comes slow and it goes so fast
,Well you see her when you fall asleep
,But never to touch and never to keep
,Cos you loved her too much and you dive too deep
,Well you only need the light when it's burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
,Only hate the road when you're missing home
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,And you let her go
,And you let her go
,Well you let her go

,Cos you only need the light when it's burning low
,Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
,Only know you love her when you let her go
,Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

,Up at Henry’s Bar & Grill
,On the north side of town
,I saw a man reach up to heaven
,And pull a song on down
,To a smoke filled room of misfits
,Young and old and big and small
,And with the laughing eyes of the Buddha
,He shared it with us all
,And every soul in that roadhouse
,Felt the power of his song
,Through life’s joys and sorrows
,He brought us together as one
,They called him “God’s own yodeler,
,The Pavarotti of the plains”
,There’s no bigger voice in Texas
,Don Walser was his name
,He was raised out in Lamesa
,Just a boy when his mamma died
,With daddy at the mill all night
,In that empty house he cried
,He’d climb up in the oak tree
,To sing his broken heart
,The neighbors gathered in the yard
,Listening in the dark
,Singing songs about West Texas
,Cowboys and old John Deeres
,Rodeos and drive-ins
,And the thrill of teenage years
,They called him “God’s own yodeler,
,The Pavarotti of the plains”
,There’s no bigger voice in Texas
,Don Walser was his name
,
,From the honky-tonks and dance halls
,To the grand ole opery
,Don Walser brought a smile
,To every fan who came to see
,Now it’s oxygen and wheelchairs
,And trips to the docs in town
,The stays kept getting longer
,He knew he was glory bound
,My friend, your work is done here
,And I’d say you did it well
,Your voice rings down from heaven
,All the way to the devil himself
,And now you’re God’s own yodeler
,High above the Texas plains
,We miss you here in Austin
,With love we speak you name
,
,
,what day is it
,and in what month
,this clock never seemed so alive
,I can\'t keep up
,and I can\'t back down
,I\'ve been losing so much time
,cause it\'s you and me and all of the people
,with nothing to do
,nothing to lose
,and it\'s you and me and all of the people
,and I don\'t know why
,I can\'t keep my eyes off of you
,
,all of the things that I want to say
,just aren\'t coming out right
,I\'m tripping inwards
,you got my head spinning
,I don\'t know where to go from here
,cause it\'s you and me and all of the people
,with nothing to do
,nothing to prove
,and it\'s you and me and all of the people
,and I don\'t know why
,I can\'t keep my eyes off of you
,there\'s something about you now
,I can\'t quite figure out
,everything she does is beautiful
,everything she does is right
,cause it\'s you and me and all of the people

,Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
,Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
,If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
,Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
,Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
,And would it be okay if I didn't know the way

,And make me the happiest man in the world

,Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea

,Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
,Could you not look down forever
,If you were lighter than a feather
,Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me
,If I gave you my hand would you take it

,Child is slowly taken
,And the violence caused such silence
,Who are we mistaken
,But You see it's not me,
,It s not my family
,In your head,in your head
,They are fighting
,With their tanks, and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are crying

,Heart is taking over
,When the violence causes silence
,We must be mistaken
,It's the same old theme since 1916
,In your head,
,In your head they're still fighting
,With their tanks ,and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are dying
,In your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie

,Frontier town, home of the westren hero
,Frontier justice, dealt with the iron hand
,
,He wore a long coat to the ground
,He wore big boots that made a sound
,He wore a six gun on his hip
,But now he doesn't carry it
,
,Sure enough, he was a western hero
,On the deck, sighting an old Jap zero
,
,And on the shores at Normandy
,He fought for you, he fought for me
,Across the land and on the sea
,But now he's just a memory
,
,And in the distance, the rocket's red glare
,The bombs burst in the air
,This time we're never going back
,
,Through the years he changed somehow
,He's different now
,He's different now
,
,Open fire, here comes the western hero
,Standing there, big money in his hand
,Sure enough, he was a western hero
,Sure enough
,
,Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
,Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
,She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
,Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”
,Here comes the story of the Hurricane
,The man the authorities came to blame
,For somethin’ that he never done
,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
,The champion of the world
,
,Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty see
,And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously
,“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
,“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand
,I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops
,“One of us had better call up the cops”
,And so Patty calls the cops
,And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’
,In the hot New Jersey night
,
,Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
,Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around
,Number one contender for the middleweight crown
,Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
,When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
,Just like the time before and the time before that
,In Paterson that’s just the way things go
,If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
,’Less you wanna draw the heat
,
,Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
,Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around
,He said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights
,They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
,And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
,Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
,So they took him to the infirmary
,And though this man could hardly see
,They told him that he could identify the guilty men
,
,Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in
,Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
,The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye
,Says, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”
,Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
,The man the authorities came to blame
,For somethin’ that he never done
,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
,The champion of the world
,
,Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
,Rubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name
,While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
,And the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame
,“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
,“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
,“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
,“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”
,“Don’t forget that you are white”
,
,Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
,Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
,We got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello
,Now you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
,You’ll be doin’ society a favor
,That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver
,We want to put his ass in stir
,We want to pin this triple murder on him
,He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”
,
,Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
,But he never did like to talk about it all that much
,It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay
,And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
,Up to some paradise
,Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
,And ride a horse along a trail
,But then they took him to the jailhouse
,Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
,
,All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
,The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
,The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
,To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
,And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
,No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
,And though they could not produce the gun
,The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
,And the all-white jury agreed
,
,Rubin Carter was falsely tried
,The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
,Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
,And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
,How can the life of such a man
,Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
,To see him obviously framed
,Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
,Where justice is a game
,
,Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
,Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
,While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
,An innocent man in a living hell
,That’s the story of the Hurricane
,But it won’t be over till they clear his name
,And give him back the time he’s done
,Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
,The champion of the world
I have had my fun
If I never get well no more

,Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
,The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
,Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
,Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
,The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
,Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
,But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
,Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
,Oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
,Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
,See she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
,Lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
,Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
,For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
,Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
,Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
,Standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
,Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
,And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
,Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
,Oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
,Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
,Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body

,Foundationed deep somehow
,Ahh, but I was so much older then

,From phony jealousy
,To memorizing politics
,Of ancient history
,Flung down by corpse evangelists
,Unthought of, though somehow

,A self-ordained professor's tongue
,Too serious to fool

,Is just equality in school
,Equality, I spoke the word
,As if a wedding vow
,Ahh, but I was so much older then
,I'm younger than that now
,In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
,At the mongrel dogs who teach
,Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
,In the instant that I preach
,My existence led by confusion boats
,Mutiny from stern to bow
,Ahh, but I was so much older then
,I'm younger than that now
,Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
,Too noble to neglect
,Deceived me into thinking
,I had something to protect
,Good and bad, I define these terms
,Quite clear, no doubt somehow
,Ahh, but I was so much older then
,I'm younger than that now

,在夏天结束的瞬间怀念你年轻身影
,你每天都在说的那些话如今讲给谁人听
,当过往散了爱慕与光阴相向而行
,你眼神烙印岁月最后的深情
,也许一次离别就能抹去再多的重逢
,那年一起种下的树啊如今飘荡着一样的风
,当誓言终将欺了日月这爱恋不澈不浓
,你裙摆绽放走向我脚步轻松
,可是命运啊 渴望啊 和热烈啊
,非将这生长赋予悲欢交织的感动
,夏日轻柔的晚风 壮阔波澜的相拥
,已杂草丛生
,都不及你第一次望向我的面容

,我发现我还是像原来那么**
,一直想你
,那么矫情
,我们聊了很多的天都关于未来
,你也说过跟我在一起时都很愉快
,还是说你其实只是在哄我**
,我已经二十四可还是分辨不来
,然而你从来都没说过要在一块
,哪怕愿意给个机会去试试看
,我就这样无怨无悔的放你离开
,也许这种桥段你早就司空见惯
,我的不安
,你不明白
,我最喜欢看你说话时候那么冷静
,一丝不苟的表情总是让我着迷
,我最讨厌你对我说话时永远严谨
,如果你爱我你怎么能这么理性
,倘若有天有机会能让你为我倾心
,我一定把握机会对你不离不弃
,可我现在只能呆在家里等你微信
,在等你想起我然后带我吃鸡
,大吉大利
,今晚吃鸡
,我也知道写一首歌无法让你爱我
,毕竟你身边的选择实在是很多
,可我还是想知道你有没有听过
,会不会因为我而发条微博
,发条微博
,有关于我
,如果这首歌突然之间就烂了大街
,那么你在哪里都会听见我的想念
,可我还是不想就这样的袒露心愿
,所以我让歌名长到很难念完一遍
,念到后面

,Keep talking baby keep keep talking till I sleep
,Your lips would be the very sedate that I need
,I couldn’t help it that I starts to say something inappropriate
,If you could forgive my manner you would be much appreciated
,I was ghoul in the darkest nights on bed
,Praying on my sanity, anger, and regret
,It’s like a garden tomb, tomb that I dig
,Burying my sound sleep burying all my dreams
,But then it starts to bloom with bones and oozes and everything that
,I thought was doomed
,In my lifeless tomb but then I somehow realize it was you
,Who transfuse, your blood, my juice
,And you just keep on pumping
,I just wanna love so baby I just wanna lie
,Shed a light shed a light till it’s burning
,Forget about the codes and just stick onto this vibe
,I won’t be diplomatic for the first time
,Oh~ You know you don’t have to fight this baby
,We could let it be so maybe we should let it drive
,I just wanna love so baby I just wanna lie
,Cut it off cut it off cut off all the ties
,We should lose all the reasons and never ask why
,It’s happen, happen, happening up up up high
,Oh~ You know you don’t have to fight this baby
,You might just be mine so baby you might just be fine

, 却握不住她
, 有时候爱呀爱呀
, 无声的挣扎

,是如何降临的
,什么都不说 像来自天空
,轻如指尖的触痛
,你是否得到了 期待的人生
,梦里的海潮声
,他们又如何从 指缝中滑过
,像吹在旷野里的风
,世界在雾中 那些人说着
,来吧 就不见了
,从未看清过 这一座迷宫
,所有走错的路口
,那些死去的人 停留在夜空
,为你点起了灯
,有时你乘起风 有时你沉没
,有时午夜有彩虹
,有时你唱起歌 有时你沉默
,有时你望着天空

,迈出车站的前一刻 竟有些犹豫
,不禁笑这近乡情怯 仍无可避免
,而长野的天 依旧这么暖 风吹起了从前
,从前初识这世间 万般流连 看着天边似在眼前
,也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍
,如今走过这世间 万般流连 翻过岁月不同侧脸
,措不及防闯入你的笑颜
,我曾难自拔于世界之大 也沉溺于其中梦话 不得真假 不做挣扎 不惧笑话
,我曾将青春翻涌成她 也曾指尖弹出盛夏 心之所动 且就随缘去吧
,逆着光行走 任风吹雨打

,暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐 走进床头藏起的画 画中的你 低着头说话

,我终将青春还给了她 连同指尖弹出的盛夏 心之所动 就随风去了

,She speaks some night of mine
,The terrible thought
,Some night of a course of lying
,Whatever means of meaning
,And whatever cause of that
,And she speaks some nights of no one
,She sleeps some night in peril
,So echo out the profit to the term
,To the side question
,And little pain in the palm
,And she sleeps some night with no one
,Today there were strange strangers
,To make and solve this trifle
,From one ruin to another
,Now free the tail to evade the war
,Nowhere nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no
,Tonight the war’s strange for sale
,To make the lovers shouted
,From one ruin to another
,Now free the tail to evade the war
,Nowhere the nightfall calls all of these
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,Leave for the sake of her beat
,Those sacred words
,There’s no other, no other, no
,For the sake of her
,Don’t you like here
,You can beat your wars, beat your wars
,And beat mine

,You can be your wars, beat your wars

,You could be happy and I won't know
,But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
,And all the things that I wished I had not said
,Are played on lips 'till it's madness in my head
,Is it too late to remind you how we were
,But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur
,Most of what I remember makes me sure
,I should have stopped you from walking out the door
,You could be happy, I hope you are
,You made me happier than I'd been by far
,Somehow everything I own smells of you
,And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
,Do the things that you always wanted to
,Without me there to hold you back,
,don't think, just do
,More than anything I want to see you go
,Take a glorious bite out of the whole world

,他会随你 拼命的奔跑
,
,并不想打扰
,
,只是没来得及忘掉
,
,给点时间就好
,
,他摔到我受不了
,我想你永远不会知道
,
,在心上有你留 的记号
,不是我疯了才哭着傻笑
,
,只是在慢慢蜕变的征兆
,
,所以就 让我不懂事的心跳
,再倔强一次好不好
,
,好不好
,
,好不好

,When my heart is ready to burst,
,When the world spins in reverse
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you go, turn down the light
,No one's here to hold you in the night
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home!
,When our picture fades in the SUN
,And all the colors blur in the one
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home!
,When your all gets blinded
,When you fold with the cards
,No, I'll never stop fighting
,To get to where you are!
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,Wherever we go
,When the lights are faded to black
,Only stars are guiding me back
,I'll keep running
,To the place where I belong
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home
,When you think you're on your own
,I'm still coming home
,Well she calls me up when she’s broken,
,Says to leave my front door open,
,I come home to find her smoking,
,With her eyes all fragile and thin,
,She’s always been hopeless at hoping,
,Always coped badly with coping,
,And I never know when she’s joking,
,She never lets anyone in,
,I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
,And she’ll never tire of these games,
,Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
,I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
,And we’ll drink too much for a wednesday,
,She’ll ask me why none of her men stay,
,I tell her just what her friends say,
,It never goes down too well,
,And she’ll stay hear til late in the evening,
,But she’s always arriving or leaving,
,Never decides to believe in,
,The people who know her so well,
,I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
,And she’ll never tire of these games,
,Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
,I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
,She says if we’re single at 40,
,We’ll get married and move to the country,
,But I know she’ll never want me,
,Then its five fifteen in the morning,
,I reach for her whilst I’m yawning,
,She leaves me with no warning.

,I will trust you in the danger
,No I won't feel any harm
,Panic will not overtake me
,You will hold me in your arms
,The walls I built are the walls you break
,You are here in the mess I make
,A hurting heart is a heart you take
,We are safe and sound
,Arrows fly but they won't come close
,Angel wings everywhere I go
,Now and always this I know
,I am safe and sound
,Carry me home
,Carry me home
,When I fall down you will catch me
,When I stumble you are there
,You will get me out of trouble
,You will hold me in your arms
,The walls I built are the walls you break
,You are here in the mess I make
,A hurting heart is a heart you take
,We are safe and sound
,Arrows fly but they won't come close

,
,It was just like yesterday
,
,When you choose to leave and I to stay
,It was a warm and sunny day
,
,But my heart felt as heavy as stone
,
,Never told me where you went
,
,Then again I never try to ask
,Now I know in life you have one chance
,And you better use it well
,
,When the mountains fall
,
,And the oceans flood
,I'm still in search of you
,Only thing I want to say
,
,I'm still in love with you
,
,Finally I found your place
,
,Sadly I came three summers late
,Now I'm sitting by your grave
,And I sing this song for you
,
,When the mountains fall
,
,And the oceans flood
,I'm still in search of you
,
,Only thing i want to say
,
,I'm still in love with you
,
,One last thing
,
,I have to say
,
,I'm still in love with you

,If only I could see
,What you mean to me
,To leave you in the dark
,And almost break your heart!
,If only I could prize
,What you gave to me
,I’d stand up from this daze
,To hand it back to thee
,All I raise is bewilderment
,And I don’t want to cause you pain
,But I’ll be losing in the end
,I’ll be longing anyway
,I’ll be crying for a friend
,If only I could find
,Where my ardour sleeps
,I’d wake it and make it shine
,And down the road I’d reap
,If only I could say
,The words you long to hear
,To wipe your tears away
,And share our lives, my dear!
,All I raise is entanglement
,And I don’t want to cause you pain
,I’ll be losing in the end
,I’ll be longing anyway
,I’ll be crying for a friend
,And in the silence of the night
,I have lost you out of sight
,I’ll be losing in the end
,I’ll be longing anyway
,I’ll be crying for a friend
,You are a lover from today
,Can you afford to dump a friend?
,Will you ignore me again?
,Will he always be there?
,And now you are walking hand in hand
,Demonstrating something unreal
,I know it feels good to depend
,Will he always be there?
,It's not a shame, not a glory
,Just a romantic day
,Maybe you'll never be sorry
,I'm not always quite right
,You are a lover from today
,Can you afford to dump a friend?
,Will you ignore me again?
,Will he always be there?
,And now from the corner of the street
,I see you kissing his face
,Does he smell really sweet
,Will he
,Will you
,I'm sad, aren't I
,You are a lover from today
,It's just a romantic day
,I will dream of you tonight
,And it all will happen to me...
,
,
,
,
,
,I've been trying to tell you how I feel
,For quite some time
,Trying to work out in my head if this is real
,For quite some time
,Why don't you just lay down next to me?
,Why don't you just lay down next to me
,While I speak...
,Listen to the birds and the sea
,Washing over you and me
,While I weep...
,If you love her then you've gotta let go
,If you love her then you've gotta let her know
,If you love her
,If you love her
,If you love her then you've gotta let go
,If you love her then you've gotta let her know
,If you love her
,If you love her
,I've been keeping everything deep inside
,For way too long
,And now I know that the time is right
,To tell you I was wrong
,Why don't you just lay down next to me?
,Why don't you just lay down next to me?
,While I speak...
,Listen to the birds and the sea
,Washing over you and me
,While I weep...
,If you love her then you've gotta let go
,If you love her then you've gotta let her know
,If you love her
,If you love her
,If you love her then you've gotta let go

,If you love her
,If you love her
,If you love her then you've gotta let go
,If you love her then you've gotta let her know
,
,Didn't wanna be a ghost
,But you pushed me over and over
,Never thought I'd have a vice
,Other than you, over and over
,Left you in the sky with the fire below
,Thought I had it right but I'm still
,Lost in the light
,And I don't know what night it is
,You're somewhere else I'm drinking not to guess
,Blurry bodies but you're on my mind
,We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go I go
,I never thought a sunrise
,Could burn more than a midnight without you
,Already paying for tonight
,Head spins like a carousel, over and over
,Left you in the sky with the fire below
,Thought I had it right but I'm still
,Lost in the light
,And I don't know what night it is
,You're somewhere else I'm drinking not to guess
,Blurry bodies but you're on my mind

,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go out just so I can reforget
,I go I go
,Two more footsteps on the wood floor
,But it ain't you
,I'm faded so I bring someone home
,Over and over, I do this and I'm still
,Lost in the light
,And I don't know what night it is
,You're somewhere else I'm drinking not to guess
,Blurry bodies but you're on my mind
,We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
,I go out just so I can reforget

,For Your grace to take me under

,And I can't pretend that I'm not scared
,Searching for You, I know You're out there
,My faith is weak, and the storm is getting stronger

,A chosen child of golden sun
,A marble dog that chases cars
,To farthest reaches of the beach
,and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars
,A cosmic fish they love to kiss
,They're giving birth to constellation
,No riffs and oh no reservation

,Tiding the evenflows of hunger
,You're dancing naked there for me
,You expose all memory
,You make the most of boundary

,It's calling out my name
,And washing me away
,Oh, no it's never gonna let me go

,i remember every word that you said
,but i wonder if i was really
,the love you drink it all of full
,and the trees white and drunk
,and strip down of their clothes
,and i realize i am not sure
,what you look like anymore
,but every cell says i remember you well
,but it's been so long since i saw you laugh out loud
,and if i could , i ply our boat, snow it tonight

,What a waste, I could've been your lover

,Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
,When it's blowing up a storm in May
,Travel south until your skin turns, woman
,Travel south until your skin turns brown
,Put a language in your head and get on a train
,And then come back to the one you love
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part
,Of this lifetime of dreaming
,That extends to the heart
,Of this long summer feeling
,Quiet night you see the tv's glowing
,Quiet night,you here the walls are awake
,Being you, I'm getting out of a party crowd
,Can I see what's underneath your bed?
,Can I stay until the milkman's working?
,Can I stay until the café awakes?
,Do you hate me in the light? Did you get a fright?
,When you looked across from where you lay
,Yeah, you're great, you're just part

,Grandma and grandpa painted a picture of 65 years
,And one little house
,More than a memory
,more than saying "I do"
,kiss you "goodnight"s and "I love you"s
,Me and you baby, walk in the footsteps
,Build our own family
,One day at a time
,Ten little toes, a painted pink room
,Our beautiful baby looks just like you
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
,Just take my hand
,And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,For worse or for better
,And I will be all you need
,Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
,We'll give all that we have
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,This life will go by
,In the blink of an eye
,But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
,The cloud are gonna roll
,The earth's gonna shake
,But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
,Just take my hand
,And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

,We'll give all that we have
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,Someday we'll wake up
,With thousands of pictures
,65 years in this little house
,I won't trade for nothing, the life that we built
,I'll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
,And we'll build this love from the ground up
,For worse or for better
,And I will be all you need
,Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
,We'll give all that we have
,And we'll build this love from the ground up

,Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
,Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
,Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
,
,The kind that a rich man can't turn down
,She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
,One summer night in a dime store dress
,
,She had the looks he had the mansion
,
,And you can figure out the rest
,
,It was all roses dripping in diamonds
,
,Sipping on champagne
,
,She was all uptown wearing that white gown
,Taking his last name
,
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,
,And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,
,Yeah they're ringing
,
,Jenny was hosting junior league parties
,And having dinner at the country club
,Everyone thought they were ken and barbie
,
,But ken was always getting way too drunk
,Saturday night after a few too many
,He came home ready to fight
,
,And all his money could never save jenny
,
,From the devil living in his eyes
,
,It was all bruises covered in makeup
,
,Dark sunglasses
,
,And that next morning sitting in the back pew
,Praying with the baptist
,
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,
,You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,
,Yeah they're ringing
,
,Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
,No law man was ever gonna find
,
,And how he died is still a mystery
,But he hit a woman for the very last time
,
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,
,Standing there in a black dress singing singing
,
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,
,And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,
,Yeah they're ringing
,From this valley they say you are going
,I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
,They say you are taking the sunshine
,That has brightened our path for a while
,Come and sit by my side if you love me
,Do not hasten to bid me adieu
,But remember the Red River Valley
,And the cowboy who loved you so true
,I‘ve been thinking a long time my darling
,Of the sweet words you never would say
,Now alas all my fond hopes have vanished
,They say that you are going away
,Come and sit by my side if you love me
,Do not hasten to bid me adieu
,But remember the Red River Valley
,And the cowboy who loved you so true
,Another head hangs lowly
,Child is slowly taken
,And the violence caused such silence
,Who are we mistaken
,But You see it's not me,
,It s not my family
,In your head,in your head
,They are fighting
,With their tanks, and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are crying
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,Another mother's breaking
,Heart is taking over
,When the violence causes silence
,We must be mistaken
,It's the same old theme since 1916
,In your head,
,In your head they're still fighting
,With their tanks ,and their bombs
,And their bombs, and their guns
,In your head
,In your head they are dying
,In your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie
,What's in your head, in your head
,Zombie, zombie, zombie

,These fleeting charms of earth
,Farewell, your springs of joy are dry
,My soul now seeks another home
,A brighter world on high
,I'm a long time traveling here below
,I'm a long time traveling away from home
,I'm a long time traveling here below
,To lay this body down
,Farewell, kind friends whose tender care
,Has long engaged my love
,Your fond embrace I now exchange
,For better friends above

,I'm about to make another mistake
,And even though I try to stay away
,Everything around me keeps dragging me in
,I can't help thinking to myself
,What if my time would end today, today today?
,Can I guarantee that I will get another chance
,Before it's too late. too late, too late
,Forgive me...
,My heart is so full of regret
,Forgive me...
,Now is the right time for me to repent,repent,repent..
,Am I out of my mind?
,What did I do?
,Oh. I feel so bad!
,And every time I try to start all over again
,My shame comes back to haunt me
,I'm trying hard to walk away
,But temptation is surrounding me, surrounding me
,I wish that I could find the strength to change my life Before
,it's too late, too late, too late
,Forgive me...

,Forgive me...
,Now is the right time for me to repent,repent,repent..

,By a lonely prison wall
,I heard a young girl calling
,'Michael, they are taking you away
,For you stole travelyns corn
,So the young might see the morn
,Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay
,Low lie the fields of Athenry
,Where once we watched the small freebirds fly
,Our love was on the wing
,We had dreams and songs to sing
,It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
,By a lonely prison wall
,I heard a young man calling
,'Nothing matters, Mary when you're free
,Against the famine and the crown
,I rebelled, They cut me down
,Now you must raise our child with dignity
,Low lie the fields of Athenry
,Where once we watched the small freebirds fly
,Our love was on the wing
,We had dreams and songs to sing
,It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
,By a lonely harbour wall
,As she watched the last star falling
,As the prison ship said out against the sky
,For she lived in hope and prayed
,For her love in botany bay
,It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
,Low lie the fields of Athenry
,Where once we watched the small freebirds fly
,Our love was on the wing
,We had dreams and songs to sing
,It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

,Over seas and coast to coast
,To find a place I love the most
,Where the fields are green to see you once again, my love
,I try to read

,Spelar det längre någon roll
,Jag orkar inte slåss
,Det är bortom min kontroll
,Du lämnade mig ensam
,Och självklart blev jag rädd
,Min sista gnista hopp
,Var att synas att bli sedd
,Och jag glömmer bort att andas
,För sex, musik och våld
,Var det vackraste som hänt mig
,Sen själen min blev såld
,Att synas utan att verka
,Ser enkelt ut på håll
,Men jag lever på impuls nu
,Via fjärrkontroll
,Men jag sa alltid nej
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Men ingen, ingen, ingen, ingen hör...
,Och gäst ikväll är Jesus
,Han har kickat heroin
,Han läppjar på sitt glas
,Och Ramlösa blir vin
,Han berättar om sina vapen
,Sin tid i Saint-Tropez
,Om att ge sig själv en chans
,Om sin nya Z-3
,I en värld av Idioter
,Står han först i kön
,Han berättar framför kameran
,Om hur han bytte kön
,Eller nåt helt annat
,Som också är privat
,Om alla dom han älskat
,Och dom han bara sög av
,Men han sa alltid nej...

,I can’t imagine me without you
,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I wanna feel your touch
,It's burning me like an ember
,Pretending is not enough
,I wanna feel lost together
,So I'm giving in
,So I'm giving in
,To the trouble I'm in
,So I'm giving in

,
,I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
,But it's so cold and I don't know where
,I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
,But they won't flower like they did last spring

,And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
,I'm just so tired to share my nights
,I wanna cry and I wanna love

,And I'd sing a song, that'd be just ours
,But I sang 'em all to another heart

,踏上未知列车
,一直飞到云层最高空
,紊乱的波形中
,猜测前方可能的轮廓
,躲藏在月光背后
,电讯号变得神秘又莫测
,切断通讯穿梭在巨大身影中
,就此邂逅
,你好啊一日都市
,终于见面了尽管如此
,天明之后你说你就要消失
,你好吗一日都市
,无人知晓你真实的位置
,既然如此告诉我你的名字
,到那时......
,
,在城市最高点
,俯瞰没有星辰的夜晚
,遥远的地平线
,指引一个方向的冒险
,如果这一次不能尽兴
,就突然要不告而别
,没关系相信我们总会有一天
,再次遇见
,你好吗一日都市
,如果提起未来这件事  呐
,你是否也会有寂寞的样子
,你好啊一日都市
,所有真实都终将消逝
,可我一直在追寻它的影子
,到那时......
,
,到此为止
,如果现在挽留已太迟
,那再一次感谢与你的相识
,再见吧一日都市
,重逢总是在下一次对吧
,那么你呐
,想抵达的地方是......

,ねぼけた目を見開いた
,冷たい
,ここはどこだろう
,生まれたての君を見つけた
,透明なプランクトンのよう
,気づいていく 例えようのない焦燥
,捕食者に怯え 思わず叫んだ
,濁流の海に飲まれ 舵を取る
,生き残れるかは 誰にもわからない
,たとえ世界が 僕らを拒んでも
,灯台の光目指し 泳いでいこう
,しくじった 足がもつれて
,大群に飲み込まれていく
,クレパスの 黒いシルエット
,光の水彩画の中
,光彩の眩しいサイン波に
,あまりにちっぽけな姿を 映した
,海底２万里から 光が照らす
,一瞬の出来事の気がしたよ
,そして起きたら君はもうどこにもいなかった
,ふと聞こえた声が「さよなら???」
,ひとりぼっちのシュリンプは泳いでいく

,她骑着旧扫帚，打翻谁的牛奶瓶，
,挥挥魔杖不小心，又念错咒语。
,竭尽全力飞行，一次次跌落树顶，
,但她从来没抱怨，这些坏运气。
,
,指挥餐具分类，一不小心全摔碎
,跟随飞鸟向着北，糟糕的追尾。
,与生俱来挫败，也许很难去体会
,可是她甚至都没有，皱皱眉。
,脱帽，向着天空致敬，
,天空，赠她白云，
,握手，给春天一场细雨，
,春天，开花回礼。
,没有漂亮礼服，袖口裙摆灰扑扑
,也从不去羡慕，做自己就很满足，
,在人群中起舞，嘲笑眼光何必在乎，
,因总有人为你，温柔的停步。
,落日后，余晖中，挥挥手，
,这天地多么广阔，何不抬起头，
,她拥有属于自己的，宇宙，
,热望仍藏在，她胸口。

,Everything I want the world to be
,Is now coming true especially for me
,and the reason is clear
,It's because you are here
,You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
,I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation

,Put me at the top of the world

,Something in the wind has learned my name
,And it's tellin' me that things are not the same

  Everytime we say goodbye 
 I die a little 
 Everytime we say goodbye 
 I wonder why a little 
 Why the gods above me 
 Who must be in the know 
 Think so little of me 
 They allow you to go 
 
 When you?re near 
 There?s such an air 
 Of spring about it 
 I can hear a lark somewhere 
 Begin to sing about it 
 There?s no love song finer 
 But how strange the change 
 From major to minor 
 Everytime we say goodbye 
 
 There?s no love song finer 
 But how strange the change 
 From major to minor 
 Everytime we say goodbye

,How long
,How long have you been away
,Oh how long
,I can't find the words to say
,I've kept your picture on my shelf
,Only there to remind myself
,I have always cared for you
,Do you still love me
,Oh my flame
,Some things will never change
,I still hold your vision in my mind
,Say you still love me
,My love
,Will I ever make you see
,That somehow
,You are still apart of me
,Maybe we can compromise
,Cause our love just can't be disguised
,I have always cared for you
,Do you still love me
,Oh my flame
,Some things will never change
,I still hold your vision in my mind
,Say you still love me
,Oh my flame
,Some things will never change
,I still hold your vision in my mind
,Say you still love me

,Say you still love me
,Oh my flame
,Some things will never change
,I still hold your vision in my mind
,
,And now, the end is near;
,So I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case,
,of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and evry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the by way,
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill, my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say not in a shy way,
,Oh no, oh no, not me,
,I did it my way.
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows
,I did it my way
,
,Yes it was my way
,
,Say the words sing the song
,Play the music all night long
,And I'm dedicating all my love to you
,It's a cold day, it's a lonely night
,It's all wrong when nothing's right
,And I'm dedicating all my love to you
,Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad
,I don't know if I'm losing what I never had And I'm dedicating all my love to you
,You know you're looking at a man determined
,Everyday I'm doing the best I can
,Dedicating all my love to you
,Maybe we can turn it round and maybe things will go our way
,Maybe we can learn to live and love another day
,I can be romantic I can be unkind
,I can see through you and I can be so blind
,Dedicating all my love to you
,I hold on tight and then I throw it away
,I run out of anything good to say
,Dedicating all my love to you
,I didn't make it big and it's a crying shame
,But the dice was loaded and it's a crooked game
,Dedicating all my love to you
,When the bottle is emply and the time's run out
,We can ask ourselves it what was all about
,Dedicating all my love to you
,Maybe we can turn it round and maybe things will go our way
,Maybe we can learn to live and love another day
,You pick me up you put me down
,I don't know why I'm still hanging around
,Dedicating all my love to you
,I'm standing here naked, my soul is bare
,Let's throw the dice and get a winning pair
,Dedicating all my love to you
,Maybe we can turn it round and maybe things will go our way
,Maybe we can learn to live and love another day
,It's all for nothing it's all for free
,You can have it anyway you want it to be
,Dedicating all my love to you
,'Cause I'm dedicating all my love to you
,
,I cannot recall when I've felt like this
,It's been a long old time if I ever did
,So if I act strange I'm hoping you'll forgive
,I've got your light
,I've got your light in my eyes
,
,On some distant moon I lie on my back
,For a glimpse of blue fore it's gone to black
,It used to be like this now it's not like that
,I've got your light

,It's a cold day, it's a lonely night
,It's all wrong when nothing's right
,And I'm dedicating all my love to you
,Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad
,I don't know if I'm losing what I never had
,But I'm dedicating all my love to you
,Everyone could lose their way
,I need a good reason if I'm gonna stay
,'Cause I'm dedicating all my love to you
,Maybe we can turn it round and maybe things will go our way
,Maybe we can learn to live and love another day
,You know you're looking at a mandetermined
,Everyday I'm doing the best I can

,I hold on tight and then I throw it away
,I run out of anything good to say

,You pick me up you put me down

,But the dice was loaded and it's a crooked game
,And I'm dedicating all my love to you
,I'm standing here naked, my soul is bare
,let's throw the dice and get a winning pair
,'Cause I'm dedicating all my love to you
,When the bottle is empty and the time's run out
,We can ask ourselves it what was all about
,'Cause I'm dedicating all my love to you
,It's all for nothing it's all for free
,You can have it anyway you want it to be
,'Cause I'm dedicating all my love to you

,Dedicating all my love to you
,And I love you so
,The people ask me how
,How I live till now
,I tell them I don't know
,I guess they understand
,How lonely life has been
,But life began again
,The day you took my hand
,And yes I know how lonely life can be
,The shadows follow me
,And the night won't set me free
,But I don't let the evening get me down
,Now that you're around me
,And you love me too
,Your thoughts are just for me
,You set my spirit free
,I'm happy that you do
,The book of life is brief
,And once a page is read
,All but love is dead
,That is my belief
,And yes I know how lonely life can be
,The shadows follow me
,And the night won't set me free
,But I don't let the evening get me down
,Now that you're around me

,another headline
,another broken song
,Learning the labels
,lessons and fables I forgot
,Under the surface
,lost in the verses there is a rising tide
,And we're trying to rescue the meaning
,if only for tonight
,In between the lines and the boulevards
,Underneath the sky chasing who we are
,Wanting more before it slips away
,Screaming to the stars just to feel alive
,Maybe one more chance
,and we'll get it right
,I won't believe that all these days
,And all these dreams were only meant to fade
,meant to fade
,Zero to sixty
,running on empty
,tell me what have we become
,Haunted by secrets
,shadows and demons hide the sun
,But out of the darkness don't care
,what they call this
,I won't let you down this time yeah
,In between the lines and the boulevards
,Underneath the sky chasing who we are
,Wanting more before it slips away
,Screaming to the stars just to feel alive
,Maybe one more chance
,and we'll get it right
,I won't believe

,And all these dreams were only meant to fade

,We're trying to rescue the meaning
,To do more than just survive
,And we're dying to capture the feeling

,I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
,Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
,Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
,Talking to myself, anything to make a sound
,I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
,But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
,I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
,Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
,You can say we're done the way you always do
,It's easier to lie to me than to yourself
,Forget about your friends, you know they're gonna say
,We're bad for each other, but we ain't good for anyone else
,I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
,But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere

,I grab your key, I'm in your car
,But your headlights in my yard
,Pull up the drive, put it in park

,Come over

,When things were nice
,And I knew
,I was loved, skies were blue
,And we shared the things that we had
,But I've made the same mistakes twice
,I'm done with trying to play nice
,Since you said I'm all wrong
,I'll do in a right
,And I'll leave you to your sorrows at night
,You left me down
,On my knees
,Now it's my turn
,To watch you plead
,So cry me a river of gold
,I'll buy you jewels
,I'll buy you greed
,The kind that fools like you believe
,Can get you a better man's soul
,Cause I've made
,The same mistake twice
,I'm done with trying to play nice
,Since you said I'm all wrong
,I'll do in a right
,And I'll leave you to your sorrows tonight

,I'm pulling pictures all
,from our walls
,Till you say
,Here, here I am
,Oh, and here, here I am

,Lose every sense of time
,Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
,Day to day I'm blind to see
,And find how far
,To go
,Everybody got their reason
,Everybody got their way
,We're just catching and releasing
,What builds up throughout the day
,It gets into your body
,And it flows right through your blood
,We can tell eachother secrets
,And remember how to love
,There's a place I'm going
,Find out what I'm made of
,There's a place I'm going
,No one knows me
,If I breathe real slowly
,Let it out and let it in
,They can be terrifying
,To be slowly dying
,Also clarifying
,The end where we begin

,There's not just winter,
,there's trust.
,Without this,
,you'll sink,

,and I need to know there's a light,
,and a life still left to live,
,and I know that we will be the ones who stand tall and rise up to the end.

,No right, no wrong, no rules for me
,I'm free
,Let it go
,Let it go
,I am one with the wind and sky
,Let it go
,Let it go
,You'll never see me cry
,Here I stand
,And here I stay
,Let the storm rage on
,My power flurries through the air into the ground
,My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
,And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
,I'm never going back
,The past is in the past
,Let it go
,Let it go
,And I'll rise like the break of dawn
,Let it go
,Let it go
,That perfect girl is gone
,Here I stand in the light of day
,Let the storm rage on
,The cold never bothered me anyway
,What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top.

,Do you ever feel already buried deep
,Six feet under scream
,But no one seems to hear a thing
,Do you know that there's still a chance for you
,Cause there's a spark in you
,You just gotta ignite the light
,And let it shine

,You're original, cannot be replaced
,If you only knew what the future holds
,After a hurricane comes a rainbow

,Some say love it is a river
,That drowns the tender reed.
,Some say love it is a razor
,That leaves your soul to bleed.
,Some say love it is a hunger
,An endless aching need.
,I say love it is a flower
,And you it's only seed.
,It's the heart afraid of breaking
,That never learns to dance.
,It's the dream afraid of waking
,That never takes the chance.
,It's the one who won't be taken
,Who cannot seem to give,
,And the soul afraid of dyin'
,That never learns to live.
,When the night has been too lonely
,And the road has been too long,
,And you think that love is only
,For the lucky and the strong,
,Just remember in the winter
,Far beneath the bitter snows
,Lies the seed that with the sun's love
,In the spring becomes the rose.

Тишина вокруг, только пульса стук,
Будто в пламени, - ты в отчаянии
Если в сердце столько боли...
Если нули в любви: не видно дна
Если нули в любви, просто дай мне знать...
Если нули в любви, просто дай мне знать!
Мне не кажется, ты готов на всё...
На краю стоишь, над пропастью!
Тишина вокруг, только пульса стук.
Это я молчу, - тебя люблю.
Если в сердце столько боли...
Если нули в любви: не видно дна.
Если нули в любви, просто дай мне знать...

Ie been a rock and ie got my fences
I never let them down
When it comes to love, i keep my senses
I don get kicked around
I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now i'm out of control
How did you get to me?
(chorus)
No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one can love me like
No one can love me like you
You can make me want you any time you want to
Youe burnin?me alive
I can deny you even when i catch you
Weavin?a weak alibi
ause when the night falls you make me forget
Your love is killing me and it ain over yet
How did you get to me?
(repeat chorus)
I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now i'm out of control
How did you get to me?

,I knew I'd see her around
,I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
,Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
,I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
,In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
,I'd act like I didn't see her
,We'd pay at the same pumps
,Flip through the same stations
,And slow down for the same curves
,Run around with the same crowds
,We just needed some time
,She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
,Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
,I knew she'd find a way to get over me
,But I'd never thought that...
,...she would get down with somebody I know
,I guess that's just how it goes
,When you break up in a small town
,I see our friends and they put on a show
,Like they don't want me to know
,So they give me the go-around
,But there's only so many streets, so many lights
,I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
,I should've known all along
,You gotta move or move on
,When you break up in a small town
,For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
,But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
,I see 'em everywhere together
,And it's hitting a little too close to home
,She's so far gone, she just didn't go far
,She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
,She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
,In someone else's arms right down the road
,And I never thought that...
,...she would get down with somebody I know
,I guess that's just how it goes

,And in your way,
,In this blue shade,

,So we are history,
,Your shadow covers me
,The sky above,a blaze
,He walks away,
,The sun goes down,
,He takes the day but I'm grown,
,And in your way,
,In this blue shade

, Baby last night was hands down
, One of the best nights
, That I've had no doubt
, Between the bottle of wine
, And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
, Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
, And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
, That all I need in this life is your crazy love
, If I never get to see the Northern lights
, Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
, Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
, Baby I could die a happy man yeah
, Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees
, Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
, Your saint sure got us the cutest, the hottest masterpiece
, It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
, In my wildest dreams
, And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
, That all I need in this life is your crazy love
, If I never get to see the Northern lights
, Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
, Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
, Baby I could die a happy man yeah
, I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
, Baby you're my great escape
, We could stay at home, listen to the radio
, Or dance around the fireplace
, And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
, Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
, Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
, Baby I could die a happy man
, Baby I could die a happy man
, Oh I could die a happy man
, You know I could girl
, I could die, I could die a happy man
,I may not always love you
,But long as there are stars above you
,You never need to doubt it
,I’ll make you so sure about it
,God only knows what I’d be without you
,If you should ever leave me
,Though life would still go on believe me
,The world could show nothing to me
,So what good would living do me
,God only knows what I’d be without you
,God only knows what I’d be without you
,If you should ever leave me
,Well life would still go on believe me

,O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining
,It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
,
,Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
,
,Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth.
,A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

,
,And in his name all oppression shall cease

,Let all within us praise His holy name.

,I've been walking these streets so long
,Singing the same old song
,I know every crack and crevice
,out here in Broadway
,Where hustle's the name of the game
,And white boys get washed down the drain like the snow and the rain
,It's easy love compromising
,On the road to my horizon
,But I wanna be where the lights are shining on me
,Like a rhinestone cowboy
,Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
,Like a rhinestone cowboy
,Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
,And offers coming over the phone
,Well, I really don't mind the rain
,And a smile can hide all the pain
,But you're walkin these streets so long out here in broadway
,And i dream of the things I'll do
,With a subway token and a dollar tucked into my shoe
,It's easy love compromising
,On the road to my horizon
,But I ganna be where the lights are shining on me
,
,Like a rhinestone cowboy

,Moon river, wider than a mile
,I'm crossing you in style some day
,Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
,Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
,Two drifters, off to see the world
,There's such a lot of world to see
,We're after the same rainbow's end
,waitin' 'round the bend
,My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
,
,Is it getting better
,Or do you feel the same
,Will it make it easier on you now
,If you've got someone to blame
,You said, one love, one life
,When it's one need in the night
,One love, we get to share it
,It leaves you baby if you don't care for it
,Did I disappoint you
,Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
,You act like you never had love
,And you want me to go without
,Well, it's too late, tonight
,
,To drag the past out into the light
,We're one but we're not the same
,We get to carry each other, carry each other, one
,Have you come here for forgiveness?
,Have you come to raise the dead?
,Have you come here to play Jesus?
,To the lepers in your head
,Did I ask too much
,More than a lot, you gave me nothing now
,Its all I got, we're one but we're not the same
,Well, we hurt each other and we're doin' it again
,You said love is a temple
,Love the higher law
,Love is a temple
,Love the higher law
,You ask me to enter
,But then you make me crawl
,And I cant be holdin' on to what you've got
,When all you've got is hurt
,One love
,One blood, one life
,You've got to do what you should
,One life with each other
,Sister
,Brothers
,One life, but we're not the same
,We get to carry each other, carry each other, one

,I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
,With sword and pistol by my side
,Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
,Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
,The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
,But I am still alive.
,I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
,And with the sea I did abide.
,I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
,I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
,And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
,But I am living still.
,I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
,Where steel and water did collide
,A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
,I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
,They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
,But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
,around and around
,I fly a starship across the Universe divide
,And when I reach the other side
,I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
,Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
,Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
,But I will remain
,And I'll be back again, again..and again and again and again
,
,
,
,I want to live
,I want to give
,I've been a miner for a heart of gold
,Is these expressions I never give?
,That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old
,It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old
,I've been to Hollywood
,I've been to Redwood
,I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
,I've been in my mind
,it's such a fine line
,That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old
,That keep me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old
,It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,I've been a miner for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old

,Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
,Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
,Where the miles are marked in the blood and the gold
,I'll meet you further on up the road
,Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
,My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
,I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold
,And I'll meet you further on up the road.
,Further on up the road, further on up the road
,Where the way is dark and the night is cold
,One sunny mornin' we'll rise, I know
,And I'll meet you further on up the road.

,Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
,Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
,If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know

,Further on up the road,further on up the road
,Further on up the road, further on up the road
,One sunny mornin' we'll rise, I know
,And I'll meet you further on up the road
,I hurt myself today
,To see if I still feel
,I focus on the pain
,The only thing that's real
,The needle tears a hole
,The old familiar sting
,Try to kill it all away
,But I remember everything
,What have I become?
,My sweetest friend
,Everyone I know
,Goes away in the end
,And you could have it all
,My empire of dirt
,I will let you down
,I will make you hurt
,I wear this crown of thorns
,Upon my liar's chair
,Full of broken thoughts
,I cannot repair
,Beneath the stains of time
,The feelings disappear
,You are someone else
,I am still right here
,What have I become?
,My sweetest friend
,Everyone I know
,Goes away in the end
,And you could have it all
,My empire of dirt
,I will let you down
,I will make you hurt
,If I could start again
,A million miles away
,I would keep myself
,I would find a way

,And then she asks me Do I look all right
,And I say Yes you look wonderful tonight
,We go to a party and everyone turns to see
,This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
,And then she asks me Do you feel all right
,And I say Yes I feel wonderful tonight
,I feel wonderful because I see
,The love light in your eyes
,And the wonder of it all
,Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
,It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
,So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
,And then I tell her as I turn out the light

,I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's
,Just like a ghost you're a haunting my dreams

,Is in your eyes
,The look your smile can't disguise
,The look of love
,Is saying so much more
,Than just words could ever say
,And what my heart has heard
,Well it takes my breath away
,
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,
,You've got the look of love
,It's on your face
,A look that time can't erase
,Be mine tonight
,Let this be just the start
,Of so many nights like this
,Let's take a lover's vow
,And then seal it with a kiss
,
,I can hardly wait to hold you
,Feel my arms around you
,How long I have waited
,Waited just to love you
,Now that I have found you
,Don't ever go

,
,The days drift on by too soon

,Somehow, it seems the love I knew was always the most destructive kind
,Yesterday when I was young
,The taste of life was sweet
,As rain upon my tongue
,I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
,The way the evening breeze
,May tease the candle flame
,The thousand dreams I dreamed
,The splendid things I planned
,I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
,I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
,And only now I see how the time ran away
,Yesterday when I was young
,So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
,So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
,And so much pain my eyes refused to see
,I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
,I never stopped to think what life was all about
,And every conversation that I can now recall
,Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
,The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
,And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
,The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
,And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah
,Oh, yesterday when I was young
,So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
,So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
,And so much pain my eyes refused to see
,There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
,I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
,The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
,When I was young
,They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
,For trying to change the system from within
,I'm coming now I'm coming to reward them
,First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
,I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
,I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
,I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
,First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
,I'd really like to live beside you, baby
,I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
,But you see that line there moving through the station
,I told you I told you I told you I was one of those
,
,I don't like your fashion business, mister
,I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
,I don't like what happened to my sister
,First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (chorus)

,Those fingers in my hair
,That sly come hither stare
,That strips my conscience bare
,It's witchcraft
,And I've got no defense for it
,The heat is too intense for it
,What good would common sense for it do
,'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
,And although, I know, it's strictly taboo
,When you arouse the need in me
,My heart says yes indeed in me
,Proceed with what you're leading me to
,It's such an ancient pitch
,But one I wouldn't switch
,'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
,'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
,Proceed with what your leading me to
,But one I'd never switch
,Speak softly love and hold me warm against your heart
,I feel your words, the tender trembling moments start
,We＇re in a world, our very own
,Sharing a love that only few have ever know
,Wine coloured days warmed by the sun
,Deep velvet nights when we are one
,Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
,The vows of love we make will live unitil we die
,My life is yours and all because
,You came into my world with love
,So softly love
,Wine coloured days warmed by the sun
,Deep velvet nights when we are one
,Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
,The vows of love we make will live unitil we die

,You came into my world with love
,So softly love

,I wanna hold you so much
,At long last love has arrived
,And I thank God I'm alive
,You're just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you
,Pardon the way that I stare
,There's nothing else to compare
,The sight of you leaves me weak
,There are no words left to speak
,But if you feel like I feel
,Please let me know that it's real
,You're just too good to be true
,Can't take my eyes off you

,＂This is the moment I've waited for
,I can hear my heart singing
,soon bells will be ringing
,This is the moment
,Oh sweet aloha
,I will love you longer than forever
,Promise me that you will leave me never
,Here I .... my dear
,O my love I vow dear
,Promise me that you will leave me never
,I will love you longer than forever
,Now than we are one
,Cloud want light the sun
,Blue sky is hawaii smile
,on this our wedding day＂
,I do....
,Love you.....
,With all......
,My................. hear
,Are you lonesome tonight,
,Do you miss me tonight?
,Are you sorry we drifted apart?
,Does your memory stray
,To a brighter summer day
,When I kissed you
,And called you sweetheart?
,
,Do the chairs in your parlor
,Seem empty and bare?
,Do you gaze at your doorstep
,And picture me there?
,Is your heart filled with pain
,Shall I come back again?
,Tell me dear
,Are you lonesome tonight?
,
,I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
,You know someone said that the world's a stage
,And each must play a part.
,Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
,Act one was when we met
,I loved you at first glance
,You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
,Then came act two
,You seemed to change and you acted strange
,And why I'll never know.
,
,Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
,And I had no cause to doubt you.
,But I'd really go on hearing your lies
,Than go on living without you.
,
,Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
,With emptiness all around
,And if you won't come back to me
,Then make them bring the curtain down.
,
,Is your heart filled with pain
,Shall I come back again?
,Tell me dear
,Are you lonesome tonight?

,The drought was the very worst
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,It was months, and months of back and forth
,You're still all over me like I wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
,On my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turn black like a perfect storm
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,There was nothing left to do
,And the butterflies turned to dust they covered my whole room
,So I punched a hole in the roof
,Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
,The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,I think I am finally clean
,Said, I think I am finally clean
,10 months sober, I must admit
,Just because you're clean don't mean you don‘t miss it
,10 months older I won't give in
,Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
,The drive was the fairy worst
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,One look, dark room
,Meant just for you
,Time moved too fast
,You played it back
,Buttons on a coat
,light-hearted joke
,No proof not much
,But you saw enough
,Small talk, he drives
,Coffee at midnight,The light reflects
,The chain on your neck
,He says look up
,And your shoulders brush
,No proof, one touch
,You felt enough
,You can hear it in the silence, silence
,You can feel it on the way home, way home
,You can see it with the lights out, lights out
,You are in love, true love
,You are in love
,Morning, his place
,Burn toast, sunday
,You keep his shirt
,He keeps his word
,And for once you let go
,Of your fears and your ghosts
,One step, not much, but it said enough
,You kissed on sidewalks
,You fight and you talk
,One night,he wakes, strange look on his face
,Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
,And you knew what it was, he is in love
,You can hear it in the silence, silence
,You can feel it on the way home, way home
,You can see it with the lights out, lights out
,You are in love, true love
,So it goes
,You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
,And he keeps the picture of you in his office town downtown
,You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wards
,And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words
,Cause you can hear in the silence
,You can feel it on the way home
,You can see it with the lights out
,You are in love, true love
,You're in love
,You can hear it in the silence, silence
,You can feel it on the way home, way home
,You can see it with the lights out, lights out
,You are in love, true love
,You're in love
,You can hear it in the silence, silence
,You can feel it on the way home, way home
,You can see it with the lights out, lights out
,You are in love, true love
,You're in love
,
,Clear blue water
,High tide came and brought you in
,And I could go
,On and on, on and on and I will
,
,Skies grow darker
,Currents swept you out again
,And you were just
,Gone and gone, gone and gone
,
,In silent screams
,And wildest dreams
,I never dreamed of this
,This love is good, this love is bad
,This love is a life back from the dead
,Oh, these hands had to let it go free
,And this love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
,Tossing, turning
,Struggle through the night for someone new
,And, yeah, I could go
,On and on, on and on
,Lantern burning
,Flickered in the mind, only you
,But you're still

,I remember what you wore on the first day
,You came into my life and I thought hey
,You know this could be something
,'Cause everything you do and words you say
,You know that it all takes my breath away
,And now I'm left with nothing
,So maybe it's true,
,That I can't live without you
,Well maybe two is better than one
,There's so much time,
,To figure out the rest of my life
,And you've already got me coming undone
,And I'm thinking two,
,Is better than one
,I remember every look upon your face,
,The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
,You make it hard for breathing
,'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
,I think of you and everything's okay
,And finally now, believing
,And maybe it's true,
,That I can't live without you

,All I knew this morning when I woke
,Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
,And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
,Is green eyes and freckles in your smile
,In the back of my mind making me feel right

,I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
,I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

,Everything has changed
,All I know is you held the door
,You'll be mine and I'll be yours
,All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
,
,And all my walls stood tall painted blue
,And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you
,
,And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
,The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
,Taking flight, making me feel right like

,I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

,I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
,And meet me there tonight
,And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

, Im walking fast through the traffic lights
, Busy streets and busy lives
, And all we know is touch and go
, We are alone with our changing minds
, We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds
, Or fades in time
, And I never saw you coming
, And Ill never be the same
, You come around and the armor falls
, Pierce the room like a cannon ball
, Now all we know, is dont let go
, We are alone just you and me
, Up in your room and our slates are clean
, Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
, So you were never a saint
, And I love the shades of wrong
, We learn to live with the pain
,Mosaic broken hearts
, But this love is raging and wild
, And I never saw you coming
, And Ill never be the same
, This is a state of grace
, This is a worth while fight
, Love is a ruthless game
, Unless you play it good and right
, These are the hands of fate
, Youre my Achilles heel
, This is the golden age of something good
, And right and real
, And I never saw you coming
, And Ill never be the same
, I never saw you coming
, And Ill never be the same
, This is is the state of grace
, This is the worth while fight
, Love is a ruthless game
, Unless you play it good and right
,I said oh my, what a marvellous tune
,It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
,The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
,Like we're made of starlight
,Like we're made of starlight
,I'm a barbie on the boardwalk, summer of '45
,Picks me up, play one night at the window
,He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
,Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
,The night we snook into a yacht club party
,Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
,I said oh my, what a marvellous tune
,It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
,The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing dancing
,Like we're made of starlight, starlight
,Like we're made of starlight, starlight在
,He still look at you worrying so much about things you can't change
,You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking away
,He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
,Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
,Don't you dream impossible things?
,Like oh my, what a marvellous tune
,It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
,The whole place was dressed to the nines, and we were dancing, dancing
,Like we're made of starlight, starlight
,Like we're made of starlight, starlight
,Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
,Ooh ooh dancing with me
,Ooh ooh we could get married
,Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
,Ooh ooh ooh ~

,I was reminiscing just the other day,
,While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
,Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time.
,Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
,Took off fast through the green light, go,
,Hey, skip the conversation and you already know.
,I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made,
,And that was the first day.
,
,And darling, it was good never looking down.
,And right there where we stood was holy ground.
,
,Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
,We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
,We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you',
,And for the first time I had something to lose,
,Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
,And the story's got dust on every page,
,Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
,And I see your face in every crowd.
,
,Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
,And right there where we stood was holy ground.
,
,Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through.
,But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you.
,Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in the next  room.
,But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you,
,
,It was good never looking down.
,And right there where we stood was holy ground.
,
,Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through.
,But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you.
,Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in the next room.

,I walked through the door
,With you
,The air was cold
,But something about it
,Felt like home somehow and I
,Left my scarf there
,At your sister's house
,And you've still got it
,In your drawer even now
,
,Oh your sweet disposition
,And my wide-eyed gaze
,We're singing in a car
,Getting lost upstate
,Autumn leaves falling down
,Like pieces into place
,And I can picture it
,After all these days
,And I know it's long gone
,And that magic's
,Not here no more
,And I might be okay
,But I'm not fine at all
,Cause there we are again
,On that
,Little town street
,You almost ran the red
,Cause you were lookin'over at me
,Wind in my hair
,I was there
,I remember it all too well
,
,Photo album on my counter
,Your cheeks were turning red
,You used to be a little kid
,With glasses in a twin size bed
,And your mother's telling stories
,About you on the tee ball team
,You taught me about your past
,Thinking your future was me
,And I know it's long gone
,And there was nothing else I could do
,And I forget about you long enough
,To forget why I needed to
,Cause there we are again
,In the middle of the night
,We're dancing round the kitchen
,In the refrigerator light
,Down the stairs I was there
,I remember it all too well
,
,Well maybe we got lost in translation
,Maybe I asked for too much
,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
,Till you tore it all up
,Running scared I was there
,I remember it all too well
,And you call me up again
,Just to break me like a promise
,So casually cruel in the
,Name of being honest
,I'm a crumbled up
,Piece of paper lying here
,Cause I remember it all
,All all too well
,
,Time won't fly it's
,Like I'm paralyzed by it
,I'd like to be my old self again
,But I'm still trying to find it
,After plaid shirt days and
,Nights when you made me your own
,Now you mail back my things
,And I walk home alone
,But you keep my old scarf
,From that very first week
,Cause it reminds you of innocence
,And it smells like me
,You can't get rid of it
,Cause you remember it
,All too well
,Cause there we are again
,Where I loved you so
,Back before you lost the one
,Real thing you've ever known
,It was rare I was there
,I remember it all too well
,Wind in my hair you were there
,You remember it all
,Down the stairs you were there
,You remember it all
,It was rare I was there
,I remember it all too well

,Put your lips close to mine
,As long as they don't touch
,Out of focus eye to eye

,And I'll do anything you say
,If you say it with your hands
,And I'd be smart to walk away

,You were in college working part time waiting tables
,Left to small time never looked back
,I was the flight risk with the fear of falling
,Wondering why we bothered with love if it never lasts
,I say can you believe it
,As we're lying on the couch
,The moment I can see it
,Yes! yes! I can see it now
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Flash forward and we'd been taking on the world together
,And there is a drawer of my things and your place
,You learned my secrets and you figured out why I'm got it
,You said we'd never made my parents' mistakes
,But we've got bills to pay
,We've got nothing figured out
,When it was hard to take Yes! Yes!
,This is was I thought about
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Do you remember we were sitting there about the water
,You saw me start to believe for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

,And I remember that flight 2 30 am
,Everything was slipping right out of our hands
,I ran out crying and you followed me out to the street
,Braced myself for the goodbye
,cause that's all I've never known
,Then you took me by surprise
,You said I'll never leave you alone
,You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
,And everytime I look at you it's like the first time
,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
,She is the best thing that's ever been mine
,（hold on） Make it last
,（hold on ）Never turn back
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts
,I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
,See the lights' see the party' the ball gowns
,See you make your way through the crowd
,And say hello' little did I know
,That you were Romeo' you were throwing pebbles
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,And I was crying on the staircase' begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting' all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story
,Baby' just say yes
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes' escape this town for a little while
,Oh' oh' oh
,'Cause you were Romeo' I was a scarlet letter
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,But you were everything to me'
,I was begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting' all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes
,Romeo save me try to tell me how it feels
,this love is difficult but it's real
,Don't be afraid ,we'll make it out of this mess
,It's a love story
,Baby just say yes
,I got tired of waiting wondering
,if you were ever coming around
,my faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of town
,And I said
,Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
,I'll keep waiting for you but you never come
,Is this in my head' I don't know what to think
,he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
,And said
,Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your dad you'll pick out a white dress
,It's a love story
,Baby' just say yes
,Oh' oh' oh
,We were both young when I first saw you

,Down every hallway's a slamming door.
,No way out, no one to come and save me.
,Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me.
,Then somebody said what I'm saying to You,

,Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
,Saying, "God, if You're there come and rescue me."
,Felt love pouring down from above
,Got washed in the water, washed in the blood
,And now I'm changed
,And now I'm stronger
,There must be something in the water
,Oh, there must be something in the water

,If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
,
,We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
,
,God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
,I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

,Hey whatever happened to, waitin' your turn
,Doing it all by hand, cause when everything is handed to you
,
,It's all only worth as much as the time you put in
,In all just seems so good the way we had it
,Back before everything became, automatic
,If you had something to say
,You'd write it on a piece of paper
,Then you put a stamp on it
,And they'd get it three days later
,Boys would call the girls
,And girls would turn them now
,Staying married was on the way to work your problems out

,
,to find out what your place is
,
,But in their narrow minds

,
,Oh, but listen for a minute
,
,Trust the one who's been

, Heading down south to the land of the pines
, I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
, Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
, I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
, Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
, And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
,
, So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
, Rock me momma any way you feel

, Rock me momma like a south bound train
, Hey momma rock me
,
, Running from the cold up in New England
, I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
, My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
, Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
, I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
, But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
,
, So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
,Rock me momma any way you feel
, Hey momma rock me
, Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
, Rock me momma like a south bound train
, Hey momma rock me
,
, Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
, I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
, But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
, To Johnson City, Tennessee
, And I gotta get a move on before the sun
, I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
, And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free
, So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
, Rock me momma any way you feel
, Hey momma rock me
, Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
,Rock me momma like a south bound train
, Hey momma rock me
,If you ain't got two kids by 21,
,You're probably gonna die alone
,At least that's what tradition told you.
,
,And it don't matter if you don't believe,
,Come Sunday morning you best be there
,In the front row, like you're s'posed to.
,

,We think the first time's good enough,
,So we hold on to high school love,
,Say we won't end up like our parents.
,
,Tiny little boxes in a row,
,Ain't want you want it's what you know,
,Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'.
,

,You, with your words
,like knives and swords and weapons
,that you use against me
,You, have knocked me off my feet again,
,got me feeling like a nothing
,You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
,calling me out when I'm wounded.
,You, picking on the weaker man.
,You can take me down, with just one single blow
,But you don't know, what you don't know
,Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
,You, with your switching sides
,and your wildfire lies and your humilation
,You, have pointed out my flaws again
,as if I don't already see them
,I walk with my head down tryna block you out,
, cause I'll never impress you
,I just wanna feel okay again
,I bet you got pushed around, somebody made you cold

,And you don't know, what you don't know
,Some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean
,Some day, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean, why you gotta be so mean?
,And I can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game
,With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
,Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing, but all you are is mean
,All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life,
,And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
,But some day, I'll be living in a big ole city
,And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah

,Picture perfect memories
,scattered all around the floor
,Reaching for the phone
,cause I can't fight it anymore
,And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
,For me it happens all the time
,It's a quarter after one,
,I'm all alone and I need you now
,Said I wouldn't call
,but I lost all control and I need you now
,And I don't know how I can do without,
, I just need you now
,Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
,Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
,And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
,For me it happens all the time
,It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk
,and I need you now
,Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control
,and I need you now
,And I don't know how I can do without
, I just need you now
,Ooh...
,Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
,It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now
,And I said I wouldn't call
,but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
,And I don't know how I can do without
,I just need you now
,I just need you now
,Oh baby I need you now
,We never spoke a word
,But every thought she had
,I heard from across the room
,If we were standing face to face
,I couldn't find the words to say
,Give me one more move
,
,I don't even know her name
,I guess foolish pride's to blame
,
,Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
,And my heart won't tell my mind
,To tell my mouth what it should say
,
,May have lost this battle,
,Lived to fight another day
,Now I'm falling in love,
,As she's walking away
,
,Wise man next to me did say
,About the one that got away
,"Son, I missed my chance,
,Don't you let regret take place
,of the dreams you have to chase,
,Ask her to dance, go on son.
,You might fall down on your face
,Roll the dice and have some faith"
,
,And don't be falling in love as she's walking away
,When your heart won't tell your mind
,To tell your mouth what it should say
,
,May have lost this battle,
,lived to fight another day
,But don't be falling in love,
,As she's walking away.
,
,You might fall down on your face

,Another long summer's come and gone

,The boardwalk's quiet
,And the carnival rides

,
,But I close my eyes and one more time
,We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
,The words came out
,I kissed your mouth
,No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
,You had to go I understand,
,But you promised you'd be back again
,And so I wander around this town
,'Til the summer comes around

,I got a job working at the old park pier
,and every Summer now for five long years
,I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks

,Knowing that love belonged to us girl,if only for a moment

, 作曲 : Travis
,Suppose I called you up tonight
,And told you that I love you
,And suppose I said I wanna come back home
,And suppose I cried and said I finally learned my lesson
,And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
,If I told you that I realize you're all I ever wanted
,And it's killing me to be so far away
,Would you tell me that you love me to
,And when we cry together
,Would you simply laugh at me and say
,I told you so
,Oh, I told you so
,I told you someday you'd come crawling back
,and asking me to take you in
,I told you so
,But you had to go
,Now I found somebody new and you will
, never break my heart in two again
,If I got down on my knees
,and told you I was yours forever
,Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
,Would we get that old time feeling
,Would we laugh and cry for hours
,The way we did when our love first began
,Would you tell me that you miss me too
,And that you've been so lonely
,And that you've waited for the day that I returned
,And we live and love forever
,And that I'm your one and only
,Would you say the tables finally turn
,Would you say I told you so
,Oh, I told you so
,I told you someday you'd come crawling back
,and asking me to take you in
,I told you so
,But you had to go
,Now I found somebody new and you
,will never break my heart in two again
,Now I found someone new and you
,will never break my heart in two again

,I run from hate
,I run from prejudice
,I run from pessimists
,But I run too late
,I run my life
,Or is it running me
,Run from my past
,I run too fast
,Or too slow it seems
,When lies become the truth
,That’s when I run to you
,This world keeps spinning faster
,Into a new disaster so I run to you
,I run to you baby
,And when it all starts coming undone
,Baby you’re the only one I run to
,I run to you
,We run on fumes
,Your life and mine
,Like the sands of time
,Slippin’ right on through
,And our love’s the only truth
,That’s why I run to you
,This world keeps spinning faster
,Into a new disaster so I run to you

,When I was dreaming about you baby
,You were dreaming of me
,Call me crazy
,Call me blind
,To still be suffering is stupid after

,Did I lose my love to someone better
,And does she love you like I do
,I do, you know I really really do
,Well hey
,So much I need to say
,Been lonely since the day

,So sad but true
,For me there's only you
,Been crying since the day
,The day you went away
,I remember date and time
,September twenty second
,Sunday twenty five after nine
,In the doorway with your case
,No longer shouting at each other
,There were tears on our faces
,And we were letting go of something special
,Something we'll never have again
,I know, I guess I really really know

,I see trees of green red roses too
,I see them bloom for me and you
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,I see skies of blue and clouds of white
,The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
,Are also on the faces of people going by
,I see friends shaking hands saying How do you do
,They're really saying I love you
,I hear babies cry I watch them grow
,They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
,And I think to myself what a wonderful world
,Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
,And now, the end is near;
,And so I face the final curtain.
,My friend, I'll say it clear,
,I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
,I've lived a life that's full.
,I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
,And more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Regrets, I've had a few;
,But then again, too few to mention.
,I did what I had to do
,And saw it through without exemption.
,I planned each charted course;
,Each careful step along the byway,
,But more, much more than this,
,I did it my way.
,Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
,When I bit off more than I could chew.
,But through it all, when there was doubt,
,I ate it up and spit it out.
,I faced it all and I stood tall;
,And did it my way.
,I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
,I've had my fill; my share of losing.
,And now, as tears subside,
,I find it all so amusing.
,To think I did all that;
,And may I say - not in a shy way,
,"Oh no, oh no not me,
,I did it my way".
,For what is a man, what has he got?
,If not himself, then he has naught.
,To say the things he truly feels;
,And not the words of one who kneels.
,The record shows I took the blows -
,And did it my way!
,Yes, it was my way
,i remember...
,the way you glanced at me, yes i remember
,i remember...
,when we caught a shooting star, yes i remember
,i remember...
,all the things that we shared,
,and the promise we made,
,just you and i
,i remember...
,all the laughter we shared,
,all the wishes we made,
,upon the roof at dawn
,do you remember...?

,with the brim pulled way down low
,Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
,machine guns ready to go
,Are you ready, Are you ready for this
,Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat
,Another one bites the dust
,Another one bites the dust
,And another one gone, and another one gone
,Another one bites the dust
,Hey, I'm gonna get you too
,Another one bites the dust
,How do you think I'm going to get along,
,without you, when you're gone
,You took me for everything that I had,
,and kicked me out on my own
,Are you happy, are you satisfied
,How long can you stand the heat
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip
,To the sound of the beat

,I'm standing on my own two feet
,Out of the doorway the bullets rip

,At first I was afraid I was petrified
,Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
,But then I spent so many nights
,Thinkin' how you did me wrong
,And I grew strong
,And I learn how to get along
,And so you're back from outer space
,I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
,I should have changed that stupid lock
,I should have made you leave your key
,If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
,Go on now, go walk out the door
,Just turn around now
,cause you're not welcome anymore
,Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
,Did you think I crumble
,Did you think I'd lay down and die
,Oh no not I I will survive
,And as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
,I've got all my life to live
,And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
,I will survive
,It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
,Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
,And I spent oh so many nights
,Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry
,But now I hold my head up high
,And you see me somebody new
,I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
,And so you feel like droppin' in
,And just expect me to be free
,Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
,Go on now, go walk out the door
,Just turn around now
,cause you're not welcome anymore
,Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
,Did you think I crumble
,Did you think I'd lay down and die
,Oh no not I I will survive
,Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
,I've got all my life to live
,I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
,I will survive
,Go on now, go walk out the door
,Just turn around now
,cause you're not welcome anymore
,Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

,Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
,I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
,I fell right through the cracks
,and now I'm trying to get back
,Before the cool done run out
,I'll be giving it my bestest
,Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
,I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some
,But I won't hesitate no more, no more
,It cannot wait  I'm yours
,
,Well open up your mind and see like me
,Open up your plans and damn you're free
,Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
,Listen to the music of the moment people  dance and sing
,We're just one big family
,It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love
,So I won't hesitate no more  no more
,It cannot wait I'm sure
,There's no need to complicate
,Our time is short
,This is our fate  I'm yours
,do do do do you  but do you  do  do  do
,But do you want to come on
,Scooch on over closer dear
,And i will nibble your ear
,
,I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
,And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
,but My breath fogged up the glass
,And so I drew a new face and laughed
,I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
,To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
,It's what we aim to do
,Our name is our virtue
,But I won't hesitate no more  no more
,It cannot wait I'm yours
,Open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
,Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
,Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours (It cannot wait, I'm sure)
,So please don't, please don't  please don't (There's no need to complicate)
,There's no need to complicate (Our time is short)
,Coz our time is short (This is our fate)
,This is  this is  this is our fate
,I'm yours

,It's a long dark road that I call my home
,It's a long dark road that I'm cursed to roam
,These many nights I've been banished here
,My companion is the stars
,With a bed roll and a blanket
,And just the rocks to lay my bones
,One day from the darkness I'll come rapping at your door
,And I'll never walk this road anymore

,Oh baby, don't you know we've all got hidden treasures
,Do you remember such a time
,Before it was a sin to call yourself a dreamer
,And treasure was a thing to hide
,Bury in the woods where no one goes
,Hidden in a sailor's chest of oak
,In a place where only you would know
,Promise me that you'll tell me when I'm getting hotter
,I want to see your silver shine
,Under the moon one night carved in alabaster
,I wanna see your treasure shine
,Not buried in the woods where no one goes
,Hidden in a sailor's chest of oak
,In a place where only you would know
,Oh baby, don't you know we've all got sunken treasures
,Down at the bottom of the blue
,But old Poseidon he can't keep it there forever
,'Cause I can see the gold in you
,Buried in the sea a league below
,Hidden in a sailor's chest of oak
,In a place where only you will know
,Buried in the woods where no one goes
,Hidden in a sailor's chest of oak
,In a place where you and only you could know
,Could know
,There is a house in New Orleans,
,They call the rising sun.
,And it's been the ruin of many a poor Boy,
,and God I know I'm one.
,
,My mother was a tailor,
,Sewed my new blue jeans.
,My father was a gamblin' man.
,Down in New Orleans.
,Now the only thing a gambler needs is
,A suitcase and a trunk.
,And the only time he'll be satisfied
,Is when he's on a drunk.
,
,Oh mother, tell your children,
,Not to do what I have done.
,Spend your lives in sin and misery
,In the house of the Rising Sun.
,
,Well I've got one foot on the platform
,The other foot on the train
,I'm going back to New Orleans
,To wear that ball and chain

,Tell you I'm sorry
,You don't know how lovely you are
,I had to find you
,Tell you I need you
,Tell you I'll set you apart
,Tell me your secrets
,And ask me your questions
,Oh~let's go back to the start

,Nobody said it was easy
,It's such a shame for us to part
,Nobody said it was easy
,No one ever said it would be this hard
,Oh~take me back to the start
,I was just guessing
,At numbers and figures
,Pulling the puzzles apart
,Questions of science
,Science and progress
,Could not speak as loud as my heart
,Tell me you love me
,Come back and haunt me
,Oh~when I rush to the start
,Running in circles
,Coming in tails
,Coming back as we are

,Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
,
,And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay

,Shining through the window pane

,
,
,The love you thought was dead and gone
,Somehow keeps on hanging on
,Even when your heart has left it far behind
,Just when you have turned the page
,It seems to find a way
,And there it is again every now and then
,Every now and then
,That ol' feeling comes around
,Every now and then
,I see your face in another cloud
,And every now and then
,Some old something
,Takes me right back again
,Every now and then
,You can finally breathe life in
,Without wondering where she's been
,Go to sleep at night without her on your mind
,In a second it appears
,Followed by familiar tears
,Like a long-lost friend every now and then
,And every now and then
,That ol' feeling comes around
,Every now and then
,I see your face in another cloud
,And every now and then
,Some old something

,And I know it's all for nothin'
,There's no goin' back to way back when
,But every now and then
,That ol' feeling comes around

,And every now and then
,Some old something
,Takes me right back again
,Every now and then
,I still love you
,Every now and then
,This would not have happened
,If I hadn’t missed my plane
,I would've been there when they told you
,I’m the Rat within the grain
,Within this big misunderstanding now
,and I’m being misunderstood
,I'm thinking someone's trying to fuck with me
,And set fire to my wood
,I wouldn’t want you to want
,To be wanted by me
,I wouldn’t want you to worry
,That You'd be drowned within my sea
,I only wanted to be wonderful
,And wonderful is true
,In truth I only really wanted
,To be wanted by you
,It’s a stupid situation now
,Where everything goes wrong
,If you can't tell if I’m lying
,Then you do not belong
,In my bed
,Go rest your head
,Upon the bones of a bigger man
,He can cover you with rock wool
,And you can close up like a clam
,Because I wouldn’t want you to want
,To be wanted by me
,I wouldn’t want you to worry
,You'd be drowned within my sea
,I only wanted to be wonderful
,And wonderful is true
,In truth I only really wanted
,To be wanted by you
,
,
,
,So go play with your piano
,And write a mediocre song
,About the shell of mediocrity
,And pretend there’s nothing wrong
,I never thought
,You where a chicken shit
,I never thought of you at all
,Until you ask me to be part of it
,And now you're showing me your wall
,I wouldn’t want you to want
,To be wanted by me
,I wouldn’t want you to worry
,You be drowned within my sea
,I only wanted to be wonderful
,And wonderful is true
,In truth I only really wanted
,To be wanted by you
,La la la la
,In truth I only really wanted
,To be wanted by you
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
,And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
,And to reach the highest peak,
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Oh! I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek,
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek.
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you;
,The charm about you
,Will carry me thro' to Heaven
,I'm in Heaven,
,and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Come on and Dance with me, i want my arms about you
,That charm about you
,Will carry me through
,Right up to Heaven, I'm in Heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing
,Out together dancing
,When we're out together dancing
,Cheek to cheek
,Oh, yeah!
,She
,May be the face I can't forget
,The trace of pleasure or regret
,May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
,She
,May be the song that summer sings
,May be the chill that autumn brings
,May be a hundred different things
,Within the measure of a day
,She
,May be the beauty or the beast
,May be the famine or the feast
,May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
,She may be the mirror of my dreams
,The smile reflected in a stream
,She may not be what she may seem
,Inside her shell
,She
,Who always seems so happy in a crowd
,Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
,No one's allowed to see them when they cry
,She
,May be the love that cannot hope to last
,May come to me from shadows of the past
,That I'll remember till the day I die
,She
,May be the reason I survive
,The why and wherefore I'm alive
,The one I'll care for through the rough in ready years
,Me
,I'll take her laughter and her tears
,And make them all my souvenirs
,For where she goes I've got to be
,The meaning of my life is
,She
,She, oh she
,I take my bag
,I go away
,Away from pain, away from being still
,I'm gonna get happy without a pill
,I'm gonna leave my life behind and change
,
,I sit on a bus alone
,Next to me is a man I don't know
,I look at the landscape we're driving through
,I look at the world, forever new
,As we move on, on this bumpy road we call life
,
,I book a room in Spain
,I meet a girl without a name
,We walk all night up in the hills
,We talk about God and forbidden chills
,And when the morning comes we are still awake
,
,It is a lonely trip
,Sharing is gold for the soul
,I move from place to place and learn
,About the fires and the passions that always burn
,Inside of us, inside of human life
,
,I will soon be a man
,I do the best I can
,People hurt each other and fool themselves
,Create non-existing problems and their own hells
,I just look upon this world and I feel alone
,
,I long for my real home
,I will reach there in time
,It's not a place, of course, where I can go
,But I have a restless soul without a goal
,And so I move, move on with my things
,
,Sometimes I feel so alone
,Sometimes my heart is made of stone
,And I wish I was someone else
,In another life, in another place
,But I'm here, I'm now, I am me
,
,A change is gonna come
,Inside of everyone
,The world is getting better for every day
,Don't let yourself be fooled about the clouds of gray
,There is a better life tomorrow and not the same old way
, 作词 : JACKSON, ALAN
,Remember when I was young and so were you
,And time stood still and love was all we knew
,You were the first so was I
,We made love and then you cried
,Remember when
,
,Remember when we vowed the vows
,and walked the walk
,gave our hearts made the start it was hard
,We lived and learned life threw curves
,There was joy there was hurt
,Remember when
,
,Remember when old ones died and new were born
,And life was changed disassembled rearranged
,We came together fell apart
,And broke each other's hearts
,Remember when
,
,Remember when the sound of little feet

,He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
,A three car garage, her own credit cards
,He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
,If he could only read her mind, she'd say:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
,And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
,Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
,Would it make a difference if she said:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,And the more that he lives the less that he tries
,To show her the love that he holds inside
,And the more that she gives the more that he sees
,This is a story of you and me
,So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
,To open the door to a heart that I hurt
,And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
,Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
,I'm gonna hold you tonight
,Do all those little things
,For the rest of your life
,I want to live,
,I want to give
,I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
,It's these expressions I never give
,That keep me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old.
,And I'm getting old.
,
,
,I've been to Hollywood
,I've been to Redwood
,I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
,I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

,And I'm getting old.
,Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old.
,Keep me searching for a heart of gold
,You keep me searching for a heart of gold
,I've been a miner for a heart of gold.

,用铅笔描绘出的你
,总缺了那丝生机
,在今夜的梦里
,你我却悄然相遇
,
,明明饱含着离别的思绪
,相见却是沉默与寡语
,不知该如何去表达
,沉淀在心里的话
,
,有些冷的风吹过脸颊
,消去了泪水的温差
,也许今夜 第一场雪会下
,我想 再见到你
,
,可无论度过了多少春秋和冬夏
,无论我和你的距离足够划几个时差
,早已记不起第几次 在梦里抱紧你
,似乎你的余热还未曾褪去
,
,
,窗外静悄初雪在飞
,而独酌的我小醉
,忍不住的落泪
,想在你身旁依偎
,
,轻轻就这样一起背对背
,直到我渐渐陷入沉睡
,不知道究竟这是梦
,还是那才是清醒
,
,拂晓时也觉得有些冷
,听窗外吹过呼啸的风
,却已似乎 忘却昨夜的梦
,只想 再见到你
,
,可无论辩清了多少真实和虚假
,无论我那一次又一次呐喊变成沙哑
,也从来没有哪一次 赢得过你的回答
,也许明朝雪就落满了枝丫
,
,不留下任何可以想起你的话
,就没法再抵达 和你约定的那
,
,无论辩清多少真实和虚假
,无论我那一次又一次呐喊变成沙哑
,也从来没有 哪一次 赢得过你的回答
,也许明朝雪就落满了枝丫

,模糊的，样子啊，像时间扫去落花
,偏有几个，鲜艳如画
,故乡的雪，可曾融化
,记忆里纯洁无瑕
,同行的，你我啊，照亮黑夜的脸颊
,就这样前进吧
,骄傲的你，很少说话
,勋章却只是伤疤
,迷乱的，时局啊，既然选择罪与罚
,又怎么会害怕
,出剑吧，张开群狼的獠牙
,燃烧吧，武士之魂的生涯

,踟蹰而过路边街头
,学着别人一样饮酒
,谁的掌心中
,半寸箭刃渴望咽喉
,隐入不知名的层楼
,恍然如老练的猎手
,阴影中 在等候
,午时燕子划过杨柳
,金鸾引车光华左右
,升平歌舞中
,究竟深埋多少阴谋
,尾羽抹去一丝颤抖
,黑暗之中獠牙通透
,无情 也无仇
,机会转瞬之间弦擎出手
,箭过后 万事已休
,孰是孰非就让他人评说
,终不过 成王败寇
,只身一人行 漂过 海角天涯
,携剑百步走 点过 房檐砾瓦
,谁在抚琵琶 只为 一场肃杀
,转过身 流矢飒踏
,对错真与假 霓裳 掩盖狡黠
,离别生与死 不过 只在一霎
,半寸鱼肠剑 抵过 千军万马
,倾覆了谁的天下
,靡音萦绕舞榭歌楼
,薄丝轻纱漫过衣袖
,谁的发髻中
,半寸短剑不停颤抖
,笙歌曼舞摆动轻裘
,一颦一笑如怨如忧
,试问君 入瓮否
,抬手弄弦待君垂眸
,几多娇嗔无心而就
,纸醉金迷中
,纷乱翻腾多少阴谋
,款款相偎斟满烈酒
,氤氲之间酒色通透
,愿者 便上钩
,是时擎起匕首贯透咽喉
,来不及半声呼救
,孰是孰非就让他人评说
,终不过 成王败寇
,只身一人行 漂过 海角天涯
,携剑百步走 点过 房檐砾瓦
,谁在抚琵琶 只为 一场肃杀
,转过身 流矢飒踏
,对错真与假 霓裳 掩盖狡黠
,离别生与死 不过 只在一霎
,半寸鱼肠剑 抵过 千军万马
,倾覆了谁的天下
,只身一人行 漂过 海角天涯
,五更钟声起 晨曦 掂量枝桠
,多少不眠夜 躲在 星辰月下
,杀人者亦会被杀
,对错真与假 霓裳 掩盖狡黠
,离别生与死 不过 只在一霎
,尔虞我诈中 敢相信 谁的话
,江湖中何处 是 家

,昏黄的路灯下面露倦容的西装青年
,阴暗巷尾廉价公寓 无尽工作短暂停歇
,霓虹闪烁灯火交错纸醉金迷的那世界
,即使再如何努力都还差太远
,
,习惯性沉迷社交软件中的小小圆圈
,虚伪的假面背后无限膨胀的偏执渴望
,然而出生贫寒的他啊 只能在这长夜
,独自痛苦不甘流下泪水
,
,明日的工作也会如今日般做不完吧
,即使临近休日上司也不会停止欺压
,早已沉眠于内心深处角落的少时梦想
,二十多年净是失败无尽黯淡岁月
,
,早已不再奢求能得到任何人的爱
,却无法无视其他人幸福甜蜜的爱
,感到视线又无法控制地模糊的那刹那
,耳畔仿佛传来满含着笑意的言语
,
,用那 多余的衰败寿命啊
,交换 梦寐以求的生活吧
,
,低俯下身的人们统统跪倒在脚下
,献媚的言语吐自曾经遥不可望的女人口中
,钻石镶嵌的床铺炫目耀眼的光华
,任何碍眼的事物都将以生命的代价被抹杀
,
,寿命终于所剩无几 死亡即将来临
,环绕于美女之中的青年露出了焦虑的面容
,短暂的生命无法负担沉重的欲望
,已经别无选择 跪下吧 将你的灵魂交付恶魔

,一转眼逃过多少年我还嵌在这空房间
,馥郁的感知逶迤着爬行在破旧时间线
,解构与架建都是显像管里断续的残片
,愿我驻定这梦境月球上燃第一抔火焰
,　
,或藉由契机仍能寻回游园观星那天
,却遗失时间票根与久远更远青稚侧脸
,他等待邻星来访此端彼端一千零一年
,愿你在通晓之前之后择一可酣然安眠
,　
,---Music---
,　
,我祈你终归抵达每座灯塔矗立的彼岸
,也能彼此簇拥光线兴高采烈目色交换
,遗落于真实那些片段都折进纸间裁线
,从此我们所睹见是初阳拔地辉煌诗篇
,　
,他在最后那刻填进逐寸褪淡的执念
,你忘记一切同指令中伙伴将星流俯瞰
,人们在烫金长桥上聊起从前拍出鼓点
,何其庆幸世界可反复重写一遍又一遍
,　
,然而最后一秒回望时你笑得多温暖
,就如夏日初慕恋 昏黄灯光旧影院
,以及某一段流光翔翩南风过境的夜晚
,目光所及的星天 目光不及的明天
,　
,我急忙寻回埋在土壤里交错时光伏线
,愈拼命试图看穿 愈万物沉默无关
,残存梦想植根浮离于我视界苍莽彼端
,多疲多痛多不堪 多彩多美多耐看

,他们肩并肩嬉游穿越闹市街巷和童年
,寂寞和不安次第揉进雨点轻易就打散
,沿途好景里分享玩具火车与美味三餐
,口袋揣满发光理想在同一片夜空入眠
,　
,记得嘉年华那天星辰分外夺目耀眼
,悬崖风吹过那名少年手中背包和衣衫
,这孤独风景本美如宇宙群星赴向盛宴
,我却为何险些放逐眼泪坠出脸颊边缘
,　
,我数清多少灯盏毕剥于银海中缱绻
,看尽光芒的棱边 听懂星群的语言
,却忘了在某个时空中我们曾一同悠闲
,茂密年轮中谈天 掌纹共目光绘线
,　
,我将生途走完带着观者不掩饰的艳羡
,拢一捧月华饱蘸 涂抹风铃与屋檐
,「感谢命运感谢神祇感谢众生允我此恋」
,樱花飓风里相看 我称之幸运圆满
,　
,从何时记忆水路开始断裂开始封锁开始改变
,凛冽日光缝隙生长出成片青色橄榄
,是否有什么掷地应声粉碎在那夜海渊
,不然为何每当敲响琴键 乐谱标题都擅自消湮
,Ah...
,　
,你还记得吗 何其短暂的久远
,人生第一句诺言 穿越阻滞的区段
,如同冰封深海底涌起滚烫新鲜的烈焰
,如夤夜星云飞散 如雨后蛩声唱遍
,　
,我回头看见来路层层叠叠彼此纠缠
,须臾婚典中花瓣 刹那就泥泞万千
,我跌撞辨不清你缘何笑得寂寥无端
,那秒钟亦真亦幻 相伴也同时擦肩

,迎接扑面泥土的芬芳

,还在想呀想 倾心话儿怎么讲
,纵情愫满腔 不得话衷肠
,细思量 心所仰
,脉脉不语却见天色已昏黄
,不觉转眼共度几轮青黄
,还道如春幸福似花酿

,서로를 만나지 않았다면 덜 힘들었을까 너는

,보고 싶다 안고 싶다 네 곁에 있고 싶다 아파도
,너의 곁에 잠들고 싶다
,첨 그날부터 뒷걸음질 친 너
,또 첨 그날부터 이별을 떠올렸던 나
,널 너무 갖고 싶어도 외면할 수 없었던 것들
,차가운 세상 서글픈 계산들
,아무리 조심해도 애써도
,아무리 아닌 척 밀어내도 이미 난 네가 좋아
,보고 싶다 달려간다 두드린다 넌 놀라 웃는다
,동그란 웃음 온 세상 다 어루만진다
,울지 마라 가지 마라 이제는 머물러라 내 곁에
,넌 따뜻한 나의 봄인걸
,아직 망설이는 네 맘 앞에
,그래도 멈추지 못할 내 마음
,네게 남은 두려움 너를 안고 안아

,Don’t be afraid to cry,

,Yes my dear,
,Do you hear, its only fear, its only fear, its only fear.
,Yes its only fear, its only fear, its only fear,
,That keeps you locked in here
,Now you make believe you wasn’t bright,
,And you may not see how can find your sight,
,And maybe you wake up late at night,
,Wondering why you feel so tired.
,Well my dear, let me tell you know,

,One little light
,When I close my eyes
,I hear the water lapping

,But I never feel the bite I only feel it’s missing
,And I sail into the light I’m searching and I’m wishing for the
,Feeling of being
,How still the night
,Feeling of being
,One little light
,Wonder if we ever really know each other
,And I wonder if we ever find out what we’re after
,And the truth of it is we’re both winding down the river
,And if you could only let go,
,Find the hidden silver and the

,How still the night

,I was a little girl alone in my little world

,I played pretend between the trees,
,and fed my houseguests bark and leaves,
,and laughed in my pretty bed of green.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest swing.
,I had a dream.
,
,Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park,
,I asked God who I'm supposed to be.
,The stars smiled down on me,
,God answered in silent reverie.
,I said a prayer and fell asleep.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest tree.

,Love's taken you far
,away from my heart
,And I've been here all alone.
,Have your eyes failed to find
,What took you from mine,
,A vision that's faded through time?
,But you sailed away,
,A fine summer's day,
,Cause you heard it calling,
,A new day dawning,
,You were longing to find.
,There is a way to make you stay.

,The sun just slipped it's note below my door
,And I can't hide beneath my sheets
,I've read the words before so now I know
,Time has come again for me
,And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
,Feelin' the same way all over again
,Singin' the same lines all over again
,No matter how much I pretend
,Another day that I can't find my head
,My feet don't look like they're my own
,I'll try and find the floor below to stand
,I hope I reach it once again
,And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
,Feelin' the same way all over again
,Singin' the same lines all over again
,No matter how much I pretend
,Oh...
,
,So many times i've wondered where i've gone
,And how i found my way back in
,I look around awhile for something lost
,Maybe i'll find it in the end
,And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
,Feelin' the same way all over again
,Singin' the same lines all over again
,No matter how much I pretend
,Feelin' the same way all over again
,Feelin' the same way all over again
,Singin' the same lines all over again
,No matter how much I pretend

,This song is for the one that I love
,Come away with me in the night
,Come away with me
,And I will write you a song
,Come away with me on a bus
,Come away where they can't tempt us
,With their lies
,And I want to walk with you
,On a cloudy day
,In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
,So won't you try to come
,Come away with me and we'll kiss
,On a mountaintop
,Come away with me
,And I'll never stop loving you
,And I want to wake up with the rain
,Falling on a tin roof
,While I'm safe there in your arms
,So all I ask is for you
,To come away with me in the night
,Come away with me
,The summer days are gone too soon
,You shoot the moon
,And miss completely
,And now you're left to face the gloom
,The empty room that once smelled sweetly
,Of all the flowers you plucked if only
,You knew the reason
,Why you had to each be lonely
,Was it just the season?
,Now the fall is here again
,You can't begin to give in
,It's all over
,When the snows come rolling through
,You're rolling too with some new lover
,Will you think of times you've told me
,That you knew the reason
,Why we had to each be lonely
,It was just the season
,Will you think of times you've told me
,That you knew the reason
,Why we had to each be lonely
,It was just the season
,Like a flower
,Waiting to bloom
,Like a lightbulb
,In a dark room
,Im just sittin here waiting for you
,To come on home and turn me on
,Like the desert waiting for the rain
,Like a school kid waiting for the spring
,Im just sitting here waiting for you
,To come on home and turn me on
,My poor heart
,Its been so dark
,Since youve been gone
,After all your the one who turns me off
,You're the only one who can turn me back on
,My Hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
,My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
,I'm just sitting here waiting for you
,To come on home and turn me on

,Feeling tired
,By the fire
,The long day is over
,The wind is gone
,Asleep at dawn
,The embers burn on
,With no reprise
,The sun will rise
,The long day is over
,it's not the pale moon that excites me
,that thrills and delights me
,oh no
,it's just the nearness of you
,it isn't your sweet conversation
,that brings this sensation
,oh no
,it's just the nearness of you
,when you're in my arms
,and i feel you so close to me
,all my wildest dreams
,come true
,i need no soft lights to enchant me
,if you'll only grant me
,the right
,to hold you ever so tight
,and to feel in the night
,the nearness of you.
,I can't remember what I planned tomorrow
,I can't remember when it's time to go
,When I look in the mirror
,Tracing lines with a pencil
,I remember what came before
,
,I wanted to think there was endless love
,Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
,In the dead of the night I found out
,Sometimes there's love that won't survive

,Laura kept all her disappointments
,Locked up in a box behind her closet door
,She pulled down the blinds and listened to the thunder
,With no way out from the family store
,We all told her things could get better
,When you just say goodbye
,I'll lay awake one more night
,Caught in a vision I want to deny
,
,And did I mention the note that I found
,Taped to my locked front door
,It talked about no regrets
,As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor
,I rode the train for hours on end
,And watched the people pass me by
,It could be that it has no end
,Just an action junkie's lullaby
,
,
,We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
,As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
,Caught up in the whole illusion
,That dreams never pass us by
,Came to a tattooed conclusion
,That the big one was knocking on the door
,What started as a mass delusion
,Would take me far from the place I adore

,You're my beautiful
,Such a beautiful disease

,you made the call to lie
,deceptively yours
, i saw a black cloud
,i didn't hear a sound
,only the shell on the ground
,there was a scream somewhere
,and in the thick night air
,i put the pedal down
,as the sirens wailed
,and i sat alone and prayed
,not knowing what was to come
,but through a tear in a curtain
,in a cheap motel
,i saw with jealous eyes
,you made the call to lie
,deceptively yours
,
,i tried not to believe
,the scene that could see
,it felts like days passed by
,before i turned away
,i felt a dizzy sway
,and the gun in my hand
,stood before a judge
,he cleared his throat to say
,i won't give you no bail
,shackled with chains or love
,i knew that i had bought
,my own coffin nails
,i hear your sweet voice calling out my name
,as i stare form a six foot cell
,and from beyond i heard the words
,deceptively yours
,All of your love, baby, can it be mine
,All of your love, baby, can it be mine
,I'll hate to be the one, the one that you left behind

,Be still
,You can play with fire,
,But you'll get the bill
,Don't let him know

  I walk down the diamond studded concrete canyon 
 
 Nobody looked me in the eye 
 
 Tried to fly to the moon 
 
 Only made it to the sky 
 
 I was looking for a * truth 
 
 that I had a single friend 
 
 Searching for a clear connection 
 
 Without a digital send 
 
 Ain't it just a little scary sometimes 
 
 To find the lies that you know to be true 
 
 I'll find you smiling about 
 
 Things you don't have to do 
 
 Bill doesn't call me anymore 
 
 I hear he's found religion 
 
 Big haired blonde apprentice beautician 
 
 And all the words and gesticulations that came before 
 
 Don't seem to mean a thing 
 
 You can feel fine to drop a dime 
 
 If you're ever hanging by a string 
 
 Ain't it just a little scary sometimes 
 
 To find the lies that you know to be true 
 
 I'll find you smiling about 
 
 Things you don't have to do 
 
 I hear voices crying out 
 
 Echoes on the boulevard 
 
 Contentious rambling incantations 
 
 Of some senile bard 
 
 There's too much going on around here 
 
 To keep my head from spinning 
 
 And this constant acceleration 
 
 Blurs any ties to the beginning 
 
 Ain't it just a little scary sometimes 
 
 To find the lies that you know to be true 
 
 I'll find you smiling about 
 
 Things you don't have to do 

  I can't remember what I planned tomorrow, I can't remember when it's time to go
 When I look in the mirror, Tracing lines with a pencil
 I remember what came before
 
 I wanted to think there was endless love, Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
 In the dead of night, I found out sometimes there's love that won't survive

,While I still got the chance
,Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
,Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
,You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
,Falling in love to the beat of the music
,Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
,Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey
,Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
,Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
,You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
,Falling in love to the beat of the music
,The beat of the music
,I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
,Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
,One more night would be more than alright with me
,So hold on baby cause
,You got the soul and you know how to use it
,Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
,You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
,Falling in love to the beat of the music
,We're falling in love to beat of the music
,Beat of the music
,Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
,Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
,Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
,Can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
,Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
,Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
,Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees" Alright
,You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
,Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
,One shot, two shot, copper tone red
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,Slow driving south with the drop top down
,Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
,You gave me that look, you licked them lips
,I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this
,I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away”
,You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
,Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
,One shot, two shot, copper tone red
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,
,Well, you hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
,Burn me up and down, no where to cool it
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
,But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
,One shot, two shot, copper tone red
,Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
,
,I'd sell my soul just to see your face
,And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
,And in these times I need a saving grace
,But time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith
,.
,But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
,I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away
,I shoulda took the time to tell you
,And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
,Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
,I can't go another day without you
,Would it make you, make you wanna stay
,Girl you gotta know I love you
,.
,My heart's on my sleeve but it's turning black
,I guess I know what it feels like to be alone
,Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
,I know you know that I need you just to carry on
,It feels like my walls are caving in
,You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on
,And I'll do anything to have you here again
,.
,But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
,I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away
,I shoulda took the time to tell you
,And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
,Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
,I can't go another day without you
,.
,Yeah the days are cold, the nights are long
,And I can't stand to be alone
,Please know this is not your fault
,And all I want is
,.
,To tell you I love you and make you wanna stay
,There's gotta be a way 'cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday
,.
,And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
,Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay
,I can't go another day without you
,Would it make you, make you wanna stay
,Girl you gotta know I love you
,Would it make you, make you wanna stay
,I can't go another day without you

,오늘도 늘 어김없이 주말은 돌아오고
,하필 꼭 이런날 아침은 알람보다 빨라
,채널을 막 돌려봐도 늘 같은 드라마에
,언제나 위기의 순간 나타나는 왕자님이 있죠
,비가 오는 날에는 나의 넓은 우산이 되어주세요
,내 어둡고 외로운 세상에 로맨스란게 필요해
,난 여우같은건 잘 몰라 그저 사랑을 원할뿐야
,밀고 당기고 내 마음 애태우면 (몰라 몰라 몰라)
,왜 난 아직 잘 모를까 두근대는 사랑이 뭔지
,꼭꼭 숨지말고 내게 다가와줘
,가까이와줘
,전화기를 꺼두어도 찾는이 하나없고
,언제나 통화목록에는 우리집
,가끔 엄마아빠
,추운 겨울밤에는 내게 따뜻한 손을 내밀어줘요
,두팔가득 넓은 그 품안에 나를 꽉 안아줘
,난 고백하는 법도 몰라 어떤 말이 덜 어색할지
,들었다놨다 간보는 나쁜남자 (싫어 싫어 싫어)
,어때 나랑 연애할래 서툴지만 이해한다면
,그리고 있잖아 내가 더 잘할게
,너만 있다면
,(얼마나 기다리면 만날수 있나요)
,이토록 헤메었는데 이제 내게 (나타 나줘 제발)
,난 내숭같은건 더 몰라 어떻게 숨기라는건지
,예쁜척 약한척 혼자 귀여운척 (못해못해못해)
,어색해도 노력할게 연애할땐 다 그러잖아
,쉬운게 없어도 사랑하고 싶어
,좀 나타나줘

,目を細め
,冷たい冬の前に

,君の居ないこの街に
,慣れてしまう日もいつかくるだろう

,でも明日の風吹くままなる様になるさ
,それが旅する理由だから

อยู่ตรงนี้ ฉันคิดถึงเธอ 
อยู่ตรงนั้น ไม่รู้ว่าเป็นยังไง 

อยู่ตรงนี้ ฉันเหงาเหลือเกิน 
ได้แต่คิด ถึงวันที่มีเธอใกล้ 

ในวันนี้ ที่เธอนั้นไม่อยู่ 
อยากให้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงเธอเท่าไหร่ 
ในวันนี้ ที่เราสองคนต้องไกล 
ในใจฉันยังมีแต่เธอ 

แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงกัน 
แค่เพียงเท่านั้น ที่ฉันต้องการ 
แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคืนและวันที่ฉันนั้นต้องพ้นผ่าน 
ยังมีหนึ่งคนที่รอฉันอยู่ 

อากาศหนาว ฉันคิดถึงเธอ 
อากาศร้อนๆ ฉันคิดถึงเธอเช่นกัน 

ตื่นเช้า ฉันคิดถึงเธอ 
ก่อนนอน ฉันคิดถึงเธอ ทุกวัน 

ในวันนี้ ที่เธอนั้นไม่อยู่ 
อยากให้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงเธอเท่าไหร่ 
ในวันนี้ ที่เราสองคนต้องไกล 
ในใจฉันยังมีแต่เธอ 

แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงกัน 
แค่เพียงเท่านั้น ที่ฉันต้องการ 
แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคืนและวันที่ฉันนั้นต้องพ้นผ่าน 
ยังมีหนึ่งคนที่รอฉันอยู่ 

ทำให้ฉันรู้และเข้าใจ 
ในวันนี้ที่สองเรานั้นต้อง ห่างกันไกล 
แต่มันไม่ใช่ตลอดไป 

แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงกัน 
แค่เพียงเท่านั้น ที่ฉันต้องการ 
แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคืนและวันที่ฉันนั้นต้องพ้นผ่าน 
ยังมีหนึ่งคนที่รอฉันอยู่ 

แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคิดถึงกัน 
แค่เพียงเท่านั้น ที่ฉันต้องการ 
แค่เพียงได้รู้ ว่าคืนและวันที่ฉันนั้นต้องพ้นผ่าน 
ยังมีหนึ่งคนที่รอฉันอยู่ 

ไม่ว่าจะนานแสนนานเท่าไหร่

,And I dream of you.
,I don't like this time we have.
,Cause I'm here afraid of when we lose it.
,Can you hear the rain above?
,It sounds like a tiny march of angels.
,Please don't leave me here just watch me dance.

,La la you know...
,I knew you'd no longer be here,
,when the summer was over.
,and now I knew you'd be back,
,and without any words or hints.
,It must be fate.
,The world is a dream in rain.
,The splashes of water shines don't you see.
,Watch out.
,Don't step on the fish in the pool.
,I'm a little soaking mouse.
,I'm wet with a blanket of rain.
,And I dream of you.

,
,Well it's a big big city and it's always the same
,Can never be too pretty tell me your name
,Is it out of line if I were  simply bold to say
,"Would you be mine"?
,
,Because I may be a beggar and you maybe the queen
,
,I know I maybe on a downer am still ready to dream
,Now it's 3 o'clock，the time is just the time it takes for you to talk
,
,So if you're lonely why'd you say your not lonely
,
,Oh your a silly girl' I know I hurt it so
,
,It's just like you to come
,
,And go you know me no you don't even know me
,
,Your so sweet to try' oh my' you caught my eye
,A girl like you is just irresistible
,
,Well it's a big big city and the lights are all out
,But it's much as I can do you know to figure you out
,And I must confess' my hearts in broken pieces
,And my heads a mess
,
,And it's 4 in the morning' and I'm walking along
,
,Beside the ghost of every drinker
,here who has ever done wrong
,
,And it's you' woo hoo
,That's got me going crazy for the things you do
,
,So if your crazy I don't care you amaze me
,
,Oh your a stupid girl' oh me' oh my' you talk
,
,I die' you smile' you laugh' I cry
,
,And only' a girl like you could be lonely
,
,And it's a crying shame' if you would think the same
,
,A boy like me's just irresistible
,So if your lonely' why'd you say you're not lonely
,
,Oh your a silly girl' I know I hurt it so
,
,It's just like you to come and go
,
,And know me' no you don't even know me
,
,Your so sweet to try oh my' you caught my eye
,
,A girl like you's just irresistible
,I will run, I will climb, I will soar
,I’m undefeated
,Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
,Yeah I believe it
,The past, is everything we were don’t make us who we are
,So I’ll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible
,I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
,Until I’m breaking, until I’m breaking
,Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
,I know I’m changing, I know I’m changing
,In, into something big, better than before
,And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
,Then It’s worth fighting for
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible
,From the bottom to the top
,We’re sparking wild fire’s
,Never quit and never stop
,The rest of our lives
,From the bottom to the top
,We’re sparking wild fire’s
,Never quit and never stop
,Its not until you fall that you fly
,When your dreams come alive you’re unstoppable
,Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
,We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
,And we’ll dream it possible possible

,All the roads I start to walk
,Always end up wrong
,I ask myself what is right
,Sometimes I just don't know
,And I, I've been running from myself
,Never took a chance to try
,To make it better
,The devil's playing in my head
,I can't make him stop
,He just won't stop
,And I
,I don't know where I've been
,Blinded by the distance
,Trying to get home
,And I
,I don't know where I've been
,Running from tomorrow
,Where do I belong
,Take my lonely life and run
,Cause I can't stand it no more
,Don't leave a trace don't fall behind
,When you knock on my door
,And I, I know I said it far too long
,Still I'm trying to hold on
,to make it better
,But now my world is falling hard
,I can't make it stop
,It just won't stop
,And I
,I don't know where I've been
,Blinded by the distance
,Trying to get home

,It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
,Warren G. is on the streets, trying to consume
,some skirts for the eve, so i can get some funk
,just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
,Just hit the eatside of the L.B.C.
,on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
,Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
,all you skirts know what's up with 213
,So I hooks a left on the 21 to Lewis
,some brothas shootin dice so i said "let's do this"
,I jumped out the ride, and said "what's up?"
,some brothas pulled some gats so i said "i'm stuck"
,Since these girls peepin me i'ma glide and swerve
,these hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
,gonna think of better things than some horny tricks
,i see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
,I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin' myself
,I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
,they took my rings, they took my rolex
,I looked at the brothas and said "damn, what's next?"
,They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
,ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
,I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
,i best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
,They got guns to my head
,I think I'm going down
,I can't believe this happened in my home town
,If I had wings I could fly
,let me contemplate
,I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
,Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
,Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
,now they droppin' and yellin'
,it's a tad bit late
,Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate
,I laid all them busters down
,I let my gat explode
,now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
,if you want skirts step back and observe
,I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
,now Nate got the freaks
,and that's a known fact
,before i got jacked I was on the same track
,back up back up cuz it's on
,N-A-T-E and me
,the Warren to the G
,Just like I thought
,they were in the same spot
,in need of some desperate help
,the Nate Dogg and the G-child
,were in need of something else
,one of them dames was sexy as hell
,I said "ooh i like your style"
,she said "my car's broke down and you seem real nice,"
,"would you let me ride?"

,where rythmn is life
,and life is rythmn
,If you know like I know
,you don't wanna step to this
,it's the G-Funk era
,funked out with a gangster twist
,if you smoke like I smoke
,then you high like everyday
,and if your ass is a buster
,213 will regulate
  I guess you know why they are looking at you
 
 For me it started when I turned twenty two
 
 you count your blessings but youre still black and blue
 
 you should go home before your monies are gone
 
 
 You said it was over but its started again
 
 said it was easy but you still never win
 
 and its done before its started and theyre not your friends
 
 
 you should go home before your monies are gone
 
 you should go home before your monies are...
 
 
 I hope you know that I dont like you this way
 
 I know you lost it but you still try escape
 
 and its sad but now its over theres nothing left to say
 
 you should go home before your monies are gone
 
 you should go home before your monies are...

,I want to stay south of the river
,With the chains and the gold
,We can be out here together
,But you hace places to go
,Watching the sunshine blaze the gray
,I don't know why you wouldn't stay
,You should come south of the river
,Where the loving is gold
,You should come south of the river
,This is where it all starts
,I think that we could stay here forever
,Lie on the roof till it's dark
,And when the last bus pulls away
,I swear that I almost heard you say
,"I should move south of the river"
,I want to get to know
,I want to get to know, oh
,I want to stay south of the river
,I'v have the feeling
,Walking with the thunder clouds
,to get the sky right over me
,Too many things to do
,and never really satisfied
,a glass would be half empty not half full
,When you smiled at me in the morning
,I knew that everything would change
,I'll take the sunshine take the rain
,If I win or lose a game
,I don't care cause you make my day
,It can't be worse it can be smile
,could be looks and drive a while
,for any reason you make my day
,Some need an angle
,want him to change it all
,then go on something waiting for the day
,Well maybe I'm a lucky man
,cause I don't really understand
,how life can be a drag when there is you
,So I wake up every morning
,with the smile upon my face
,I'll take the sunshine take the rain
,If I win or lose a game
,I don't care cause you make my day
,It can't be worse it can be smile
,could be looks and drive a while
,for any reason you make my day
,oh na na na na na na na na na na
,you make my day
,make me happy
,so that I can
,take the sunshine take the rain
,If I win or lose a game
,I don't care cause you make my day
,It can't be worse it can be smile
,could be looks and drive a while
,for any reason you make my day
,I'll take the sunshine take the rain
,If I win or lose a game

,Make It Last Lyrics
,Tim McMorris
,I want to stay here with you
,Under sunny skies
,look in your big brown eyes
,Time goes by but my heart stays true
,And every smile you give
,your love it shine right through
,And in this moment…
,I’ll make it last, make it last
,I’ll take my time, and make it last
,And as the present becomes the past
,I’ll do my best to make it last
,I’ll make it last, make it last
,whatever it takes I’ll make it last
,And though the future is coming fast
,I’ll fight it off to make this last
, music...
,Everybody seems to think that all good things come to an end
,But I won’t fall for that, oh no, forever you will be my friend
,And no one else can make feel the way you without effort do
,And you are mine, for now and always
,and always know that I love you
,And so I’ll make it last, make it last
,I’ll take my time, and make it last
,And as the present becomes the past
,I’ll do my best to make it last
,I’ll make it last, make it last
,whatever it takes I’ll make it last
,And though the future is coming fast
,I’ll fight it off to make this last
, end...

hide me in your hollows
taste the salt that clings to me
shipwrecked in your shadows
sanctify the sea
hide me in the wisdom of your thighs
ride me like a wave
chart my secret places
navigate my shores
map the oceans traces
lick them from my pores
drown me in delusion and desire
ride me like a wave
cover me in spray
promise you will stay
I remember mornings waking by your side
your scent on the pillow, fever in your eyes
cast upon the waters, shipless I surrender
lead me to your harbour
cover me in splendor
drown me in delusion and desire
ride me like a wave
(cover me in spray)
other seas will call you...
farther shores will shine
tempt you with their treasures
bordering to mine
still the safest harbor will be mine
ride me like a wave
ride me like a wave

,In the spring of forty-seven,
,So the story, it is told,
,Old john sutter went to the mill site
,Found a piece of shining gold.
,Well, he took it to the city
,Where the word, like wildfire, spread.
,And old john sutter soon came to wish he'd
,Left that stone in the river bed.
,For they came like herds of locusts
,Every woman, child and man
,In their lumbering conestogas
,They left their tracks upon the land.
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,Well, they came from new york city,
,And they came from alabam'
,With their dreams of finding fortunes
,In this wild unsettled land.
,Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
,As they tried to cross the plains.
,And some were lost in the rocky mountains
,With their hands froze to the reins.
,Oh...
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,(music)
,
,Well, some pushed on to california
,And others stopped to take their rest.
,And by the spring of eighteen-sixty
,They had opened up the west.
,And then the railroad came behind them
,And the land was plowed and tamed,
,When old john sutter went to meet his maker,
,He'd not one penny to his name.
,Oh...
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,And some would curse john sutter's mill
,Some men's thirsts are never filled.

,Stronger than any mountain cathedral
,Truer than any tree ever grew
,Deeper than any forest primeval
,I am in love with you.
,Ill bring fires in the winters
,Youll send showers in the springs
,Well fly through the falls and summers
,With love on our wings.
,Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
,Burning lines in the book of our lives
,Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
,Ill be in love with you.

,Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
,Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
,If we roll from town to town and never shut it down
,Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
,Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
,And would it be okay if I didn't know the way
,If I gave you my hand would you take it
,And make me the happiest man in the world
,If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl
,Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
,Let me know if you're really a dream
,I love you so, so would you go with me
,Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
,Could you not look down forever
,If you were lighter than a feather
,Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me
,If I gave you my hand would you take it
,And make me the happiest man in the world
,If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl

I'm having day dreams bout night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having day dreams about night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And every night you make my daydreams come true
Well all day long while I'm working in town
Time slows down to a crawl
When I'm not thinking about you I'm checking the clock on the wall
Then it's goodbye factory and hello loving
There's a smile across my face
Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love
Where my thoughts have been all day
I'm having day dreams bout night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having day dreams about night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And every night you make my daydreams come true
Yea, Every night you make my day dreams come true.

Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again, he can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight
She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
and again
Out of gas, just my luck, four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind
She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
Homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain

,Starry, starry night
,paint your palette blue and grey
,look out on a summer's day
,with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
,Shadows on the hills
,sketch the trees and the daffodils
,catch the breeze and the winter chills
,in colors on the snowy linen land.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,Starry starry night
,flaming flowers that brightly blaze
,swirling clouds in violet haze
,reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
,Colors changing hue
,morning fields of amber grain
,weathered faces lined in pain
,are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,For they could not love you
,but still your love was true
,and when no hope was left in sight on that
,starry starry night.
,You took your life as lovers often do,
,But I could have told you Vincent
,this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
,Starry starry night
,portraits hung in empty halls
,frameless heads on nameless walls
,with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
,Like the stranger that you've met
,the ragged men in ragged clothes
,the silver thorn of bloddy rose
,lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
,And now I think I know
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they're not listening still
,perhaps they never will.
,When the night has come
,And the land is dark
,
,And the moon is the only light we'll see
,No I won't be afraid no I won't be afraid
,Just as long as you stand stand by me
,And darlin' darlin' stand by me oh now now stand by me
,Stand by me stand by me
,If the sky that we look upon
,Should tumble and fall
,And the mountains should crumble to the sea
,I won't cry I won't cry no I won't shed a tear
,Just as long as you stand stand by me
,And darlin' darlin' stand by me oh stand by me
,Stand by me stand by me stand by me-e yeah
,
,Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me oh now now stand by me
,Oh stand by me stand by me stand by me

,Though old so new
,To fill your heart like no three words Could ever do.

,Here comes your ghost again
,But that's not unusual
,It's just that the moon is full
,And you happened to call
,And here I sit,hand on the telephone
,Hearing a voice I'd known
,A couple of light years ago
,Heading straight for a fall
,As I remember your eyes
,Were bluer than robin's eggs
,My poetry was lousy you said
,Where are you calling from?
,A booth in the midwest
,Ten years ago
,I bought you some cufflinks
,You brought me something
,We both know what memories can bring
,They bring diamonds and rust
,Well you burst on the scene
,Already a legend
,The unwashed phenomenon
,The original vagabond
,You strayed into my arms
,And there you stayed
,Temporarily lost at sea
,The Madonna was yours for free
,Yes the girl on the half-shell
,Could keep you unharmed
,Now I see you standing
,With brown leaves falling around
,And snow in your hair
,Now you're smiling out the window
,Of that crummy hotel
,Over Washington Square
,Our breath comes out white clouds,
,Mingles and hangs in the air
,Speaking strictly for me
,We both could have died then and there
,Now you're telling me
,You're not nostalgic
,Then give me another word for it
,You who are so good with words
,And at keeping things vague
,Because I need some of that vagueness now
,It's all come back too clearly
,Yes I loved you dearly
,And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
,I've already paid
,Now that I've lost everything to you,
,you say you want to start something new,
,and it's breaking my heart you're leaving,
,baby I'm grieving.
,But if you wanna leave take good care,
,hope you have a lot of nice things to wear,
,but then a lot of nice things turn bad out there.
,Oh baby baby it's a wild world,
,it's hard to get by just upon a smile.
,Oh baby baby it's a wild world,
,I'll always remember you like a child, girl.
,You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do,
,and it's breaking my heart in two,
,'cause I never want to see you sad girl,
,don't be a bad girl,
,but if you want to leave take good care,
,hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,
,but just remember there's a lot of bad and beware, beware,
,Oh baby baby it's a wild world,
,it's hard to get by just upon a smile.

Outside, the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore, a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more
Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do
Lovers too, so cast
Your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Owe it to the wind, my love

,I know you need a friend
,Someone you can talk to
,Who will understand what you're going through
,When it comes to love
,There's no easy answer
,Only you can say what you're gonna do
,I heard you on the phone
,You took his number
,Said you weren't alone
,but you'd call him soon
,Isn't he the guy
,The guy who left you cryin'
,Isn't he the one who made you blue
,When you remember those nights in his arms
,You know you've gotta make up your mind
,Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
,Or are you going back to the one you love
,Someone's gonna cry
,when they learn they've lost you
,Someone's gonna thank the stars above
,What you gonna say when he comes over
,There's no easy way to see this through
,All the broken dreams
,All the disappointments
,Oh~girl，What you gonna do
,Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
,But still you've gotta make up your mind
,Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
,Or are you going back to the one you love
,Someone's gonna cry

,There once was a king,
,who called for the spring,
,For his world was still covered with snow,
,But the spring had not been,
,for he was wicked and mean,
,In his winter fields nothing would grow;
,And when a traveller called,
,seeking help at the door,
,Only food and a bed for a night,
,He ordered his slave to turn her away,
,The girl with april in her eyes..
,Ay......................................
,
,Oh, oh, oh, on and on she goes,
,Through the winter's night,
,the wild wind and the snow,
,Hi, hi, hi, on and on she rides,
,Someone help the girl
,with april in her eyes...
,Ay................
,
,She rode through the night
,till she came to the light,
,Of a humble man's home in the woods,
,He brought her inside,
,by the firelight she died,
,And he buried her gently and good;
,Oh the morning was bright,
,all the world snow-white,
,But when he came to the place
,where she lay,
,His field was ablaze
,with flowers on the grave,
,Of the girl with april in her eyes...
,Ay......................................
,
,Oh, oh, oh, on and on she goes,
,Through the winter's night,
,the wild wind and the snow,
,Hi, hi, hi, on and on she flies,
,She is gone,

,Don't they know this's the end of the world
,It ended when I lost your love
,I wake up in the morning and I wonder
,Why everything is the same as it was

,You ask me if I love you
,And I choke on my reply
,I'd rather hurt you honestly
,Than mislead you with a lie
,For who am I to judge you
,In what you say or do
,I'm only just beginning
,To see the real you
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,Romance's an honest strategy
,Leaves me battling with my pride
,But through the insecurity
,Some tenderness survives
,I'm just another writer
,Still trapped within my truth
,A hesitant prize-fighter
,Still trapped within my youth
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,At times I'd like to break you
,And drive you to your knees
,At times I'd like to break through
,And hold you endlessly
,At times I understand you
,And I know how hard you try
,I've watched while love commands you
,And I've watched love pass you by
,At times I think we're drifters
,Still searching for a friend
,A brother or a sister
,But then the passion flares again....
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry

,Like brothers in blood

,The heart is a bloom
,Shoots up through the stony ground
,There's no room
,No space to rent in this town
,You're out of luck
,And the reason that you had to care
,The traffic is stuck
,And you're not moving anywhere
,
,You thought you'd found a friend
,To take you out of this place
,Someone you could lend a hand
,In return for grace
,It's a beautiful day
,Sky falls you feel like
,It's a beautiful day
,Don't let it get away
,You're on the road
,But you've got no destination
,You're in the mud
,In the maze of her imagination
,You love this town
,Even if that doesn't ring true
,You've been all over
,And it's been all over you
,It's a beautiful day
,Don't let it get away
,It's a beautiful day
,Touch me
,Take me to that other place
,Teach me
,I know I'm not a hopeless case
,See the world in green and blue
,See China right in front of you
,See the canyons broken by cloud
,See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
,See the Bedouin fires at night
,See the oil fields at first light
,And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
,After the flood all the colors came out
,It was a beautiful day
,Don't let it get away
,Beautiful day
,Touch me
,Take me to that other place
,Reach me
,I know I'm not a hopeless case
,What you don't have you don't need it now
,What you don't know you can feel it somehow
,What you don't have you don't need it now
,Don't need it now
,Was a beautiful day
,This is what I look like today
,And I'm trying not to pull out my hair
,I'm trying how to grow it but I'm far too shy to show it back there
,That is probably why I like wearing hats
,There's no denying I'm deferring the facts
,Avoiding confrontation
,Lacks tact in a situation
,Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn
,But if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming
,And oh, it goes to show
,I've so much to know
,I wrote this for my prettiest friend
,But while trying not to prove that I care
,I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away
,She can't see she's making me crazy now
,I don't believe she knows she's amazing how
,She has me holding my breathe
,So I'd never guess that I'm a none such unsuitable, suited for her
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentery
,And oh, it goes to show
,The moral of the story is boy loves girl
,And so on but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told
,I know that I should be brave
,Even pretty can be seen by the blind
,I know that I cannot wait
,Until the day we finally learn how to find each other
,Redefining open minds
,And if you ask me
,The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed
,And it's golden, it goes to show then
,The ending of this song should be left alone
,And so on 'cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told

Old friend, tell me did you mend,
or are you still lookin' for a lover.
A little rose hiding in the snow,
Waiting in the arms of another.
Come down to the little old town
where we first found out about each other.
I spent a while being in denial,
And I don't wanna lie any longer.
Any longer.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
It's a matter of time.
Oooh oh.
Saw a flame burning just the same
like it did on the day that I meant ya.
One light in the middle of the night,
you're the one that I'm trying to get to.
Come down to the little old town,
where we still have more to discover.
I spent a while trynna fake this smile,
and I don't wanna wait any longer.
Any longer.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
It's a matter of time.
Oooh it's a matter of time.
A sweet ray of sunshine,
is coming around the bend.
And I'm ready for your love again.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
The longer I wait, it wears me down.
Don't wanna lose what I have found.
It's a matter of ti- i- i- i- ime.
It's a matter of time.

,Came a time remembered well
,When the strong young man of the rising sun
,Heard the tolling of the great black bell
,One day in the year of the fox
,When the bell began to ring
,It meant the time had come for one to go
,To the temple of the king
,There in the middle of the circle he stands
,Searching seeking
,With just one touch of his trembling hand
,The answer will be found
,Daylight waits while the old man sings
,Heaven help me!
,And then like the rush of a thousand wings
,It shines upon the one
,And the day has just begun

,It meant the time had come for the one to go
,To the temple of the king
,There in the middle of the people he stands
,Seeing feeling
,With just a wave of the strong right hand hes gone
,To the temple of the king
,Far from the circle at the edge of the world
,Hes hoping wondering
,Thinking back on the stories hes heard of
,What hes going to see
,There in the middle of a circle it lies
,Heaven help me!
,Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
,The answer had been found
,Back with the people in the circle he stands
,Giving feeling
,With just one touch of a strong right hand they know
,Of the temple and the king

,Pillow case on his head
,No more breathing time
,An ambulance sped
,It sped round every corner
,Calling out his name

,Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
,Sat and watched in the summer corn grow
,Ate ice cream in a desert dream
,And got lost in father's singing

,Trapped in the past
,I just can not seem to move on
,I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
,Just in case I ever need them again someday
,I've been setting aside time
,To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
,All I wanna do is find a way back into love
,I can't make it through without a way back into love
,Oh oh oh

,I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
,I know that it is out there
,There is got to be something for my soul somewhere
,I've  been looking for someone to share some lights
,Not just somebody just to get me through the night
,I could use some direction
,And I'm open to your suggestions

,Back In Town
,by Matt Dusk
,from the album "Back In Town"
,
,It seems just like yesterday when we were standing here
,Yankee's hat upon my head and your voice in my ear
,You talked about the future and all the things we'd do
,I never thought your lovin' words would frighten me from you.
,
,I remember when I sold my car to board that train
,You said you were sure that I would not come back again
,And now you see with your own eyes and start to realize
,I'm not the man I thought I was, so try to sympathize.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz your man is back in town.
,
,I'm sure you've been thinkin' 'bout just where the hell I've been
,Painted your own pictures of the trouble I got in
,There were times I will admit my heart saw better days
,But I'm the type that has to lose to find I had it made.
,
,No use talkin' too much about things we cannot change
,I know you think it's crazy but I'm here to set things straight
,I'm standing here to say that I'll give love a try
,It's my complicated way to say I'll simplify.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz your man is back in town
,Baby it's cool to take your time
,I was a fool, out of my mind
,So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
,'cuz your man is back in town.
,
,I was drawn away, now I'm back to stay
,I was wrong to think, there was a better way
,Now I see with my own eyes, 'bout time I realize
,I hope in time you will forgive, I'll never leave your side.
,
,The way you think about your life
,Is gonna change, change tonight
,Don't even try out that frown
,'cuz you man is back in town
,Baby it's cool to take your time
,I was a fool, out of my mind
,So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
,'cuz your man is back in town
,So let's jump off of this merry-go-round

,We were both young when I first saw you
,I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there
,On a balcony in summer air
,See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
,See you make your way through the crowd and say hello
,Little did I know
,
,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,And I was crying on the staircase, begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
,So close your eyes
,Escape this town for a little while
,Oh, oh, oh
,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
,And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
,But you were everything to me, I was begging you please don't go
,And I said
,Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
,I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
,You'll be the prince and I'll be this princess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,Romeo save me , they try to tell me how it feels
,This love is difficult, but it's real
,Don't be afraid , we'll get out of this mess
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,I got tired of waiting
,Wondering if you were ever coming around
,My faith in you was fading
,When I met you on the outskirts of town
,And I said
,Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
,I keep waiting for you but you never come
,Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
,He knelt to the groud and pulled out a ring and said
,Marry me ,Juliet
,You'll never have to be alone
,I love you and that's all I really know
,I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
,It's a love story Baby, just say yes
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,Oh, oh, oh
,
,Cause we were both young when I first saw you
,Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
,You know it used to be mad love
,So take a look what you've done
,Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
,I can't take it back, look where I'm at
,We was on D like DOC, remember that?
,My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
,Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
,I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
,These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
,
,Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
,No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more
,
,Oh, it's so sad to
,Think about the good times
,You and I
,Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
,You know it used to be mad love
,So take a look what you've done
,Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
,Now we've got problems
,And I don't think we can solve 'em
,You made a really deep cut
,And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
,Remember when you tried to write me off?
,Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
,Don't you remember? You thought I would need yah
,Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia
,It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
,Body bumped, bruised
,Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
,Still, all my life, I got money and power
,And you gotta live with the bad blood now
,Oh, it's so sad to
,Think about the good times
,You and I
,Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
,You know it used to be mad love
,So take a look what you've done

,And I don't think we can solve 'em
,You made a really deep cut
,And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
,Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
,You say sorry just for show
,You live like that, you live with ghosts
,(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
,Band-aids don't fix bullet holes

,.
,
,And now that I can put this down
,If I had known what I know now
,I never would have played so nonchalance
,.
,
,Taxi cabs and busy streets

,I can't help but wish you took me with you
,
,.
,And this is when the feeling sinks in

,I wake up stretch out
,I wonder what you re doing right now
,Yeah I slept in my makeup again
,Tell myself I must be crazy thinking about him
,I find myself in these simple ways
,
,Take the towel out of my hair
,About that time you call me
,I m reminded without you I d be
,A stranger in an all night diner
,
,Waiting for her love to find her
,
,Lonely like a harbor line
,That s never seen a boat
,
,Just like a line in an old letter
,
,No one ever wrote
,
,I go to work work all day
,
,I want a tape recorder for everything you say
,
,Walk to the car dig out my keys
,
,Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
,I d be a stranger in an all night diner
,
,Waiting for her love to find her
,
,Lonely like a harbor line
,That s never seen a boat
,
,Just like a line in an old letter

,Standing there waiting on me
,
,I show you my new shoes
,You say you love them
,Baby without you
,
,I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
,
,Waiting for her love to find her
,
,Lonely like a harbor line
,That s never seen a boat
,
,Just like a line in an old letter
,No one ever wrote
,
,I wake up stretch out
,
,Wonder what you re doing right now
,I live down the street in a broken down house
,And a car up on blocks in the driveway
,The moment we meet there was never a doubt
,That we won’t forget this Sunday
,It starts with a smile and a walk in miles
,And it all leads to this - our first kiss
,All my friends are saying
,Girl what are you thinking
,You’re better off, you’re better off without him.
,Find yourself another
,Girl, that boy is trouble
,You’re better off, you’re better off
,They can talk forever, they just don’t know better.
,
,We drive around town in a rusty old truck
,Somehow it feels like we’re flying
,Don’t wanna come down
,But they make it so tough
,Just everyone we know is trying
,To push us apart hidden down in our hearts
,And they get what they want cause you're gone
,All my friends are saying
,Girl why are you crying
,You’re better off, you’re better off without him.
,Find yourself another
,Girl, that boy is trouble
,You’re better off, you’re better off
,They can talk forever, they just don’t know better.
,You come to my door
,In the pouring rain
,We know what we don’t have to say
,You hand me a rose and a note that says
,We don’t have to do things their way
,All my friends are saying
,Girl what are you thinking
,You’re better off, you’re better off without him.
,Find yourself another
,Girl, that boy is trouble
,You’re better off, you’re better off
,They can talk forever, they just don’t know better.
,I drive around this town in a mustang with the top down
,And six running horses under my hood
,Well that’s good enough for me
,I don’t need the real thing
,That’s just another thing for me to try to tame
,I don’t know if I could' it might just break me
,I thought there for a little while every sunset
,I’d be riding off with him
,Snap buttons on a denim shirt
,Blue jeans and a little dirt
,That’s the closest you’ll see me
,Feet hanging out a pickup truck
,Crazy and a little rough' running free
,That’s the closest to a cowboy you’ll see me
,Before I met him I was so safe and grounded
,Before he taught me how to lie and crawl out the window
,I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken
,Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
,And how to let go
,I thought there for a little while every sunset
,I’d be riding off with him
,Snap buttons on a denim shirt

,And time stands still when you’re nowhere bound

,If I could drive all night

,And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
,In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
,Oh Yeah...

,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
,In a storm in my best dress, fearless
,So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road

,In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
,In this moment now, capture it, remember it
,'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
,You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
,And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
,In a storm in my best dress, fearless
,Oh Oh
,Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
,My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
,But you pull me in and I'm little more brave
,It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something.
,It's fearless.
,Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Yeah!

,Wish I had concentrated,
,They said love was complicated,
,But it's something I just fell into.
,And it was overrated,
,But just look what I created,
,I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
,Before you ask me if I'm alright,
,Think about what I,
,Had to do... yeah,
,Wake up and smell the break up,
,Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
,Another mess I didn't plan.
,And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
,Wish you could only see,
,I got an I Heart Question Mark
,Written on the back of my hand!
,I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,
,But you had to talk about why
,You were wrong and I was right.
,But I can't believe you made me,
,Sit at home and cry like a baby,
,Wait right by the phone every night.
,And now you ask about you and I,
,There's no you and I,
,Remember what you put me through,
,I had to...
,Wake up and smell the break up,
,Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
,Another mess I didn't plan.
,And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
,Wish you could only see
,I got an I Heart Question Mark
,Written on the back of my hand!
,And when you're home all alone at night,
,You'll still wonder why
,You took everything I had, oh baby.
,I haven't thought about you and I,
,There's no you and I, and I know
,Someday you will...
,Wake up and smell the break up,
,Realize that we won't make up,
,It didn't go the way you planned.
,And you'll know you didn't beat me
,When you look down and see
,I got an I Heart Question Mark
,Written on the back of my hand!
,Oh~ written on the back of my hand!
,An I Heart Question Mark, yeah.
,Oh~ written on the back of my hand

,"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)"
,She said, I was seven and you were nine
,I looked at you like the stars that shined
,In the sky, the pretty lights
,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
,Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
,And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
,Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
,Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
,You never did, you never did
,Take me back when our world was one block wide
,I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
,Just two kids, you and I
,Oh my my my my
,Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
,I wasn't that little girl you used to see
,But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
,They never believed we'd really fall in love
,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
,And said oh my my my
,Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
,Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
,Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
,The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
,You stayed outside till the morning light
,Oh my my my my
,A few years had gone and come around
,We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
,And you looked at me, got down on one knee
,Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
,Our whole town came and our mamas cried
,You said I do and I did too
,Take me home where we met so many years before
,We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
,After all this time, you and I
,I'll be eighty-seven you'll be eighty-nine
,I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
,In the sky, oh my my my
,I can’t believe you did it again' walk by and took my heart with you
,Why’d you have to look so good' don’t you know I’m trying to hate you
,Try to have a dream without you anyway' but how can I put out this fight
,When you’re the one who’s leading?
,I can’t wait for the day I’ll stop pretending that I’m really okay when I’m not
,I wanna know how it feels to be lover you for real' till I do
,I keep writing songs about you
,I got a sack of paper so high and it’s all about you baby
,Keep thinking maybe he I make sense of something crazy
,Something I can get out of my head
,I write your name' I write your name and I tear it out to shreds
,I can’t wait for the day I’ll stop pretending that I’m really okay when I’m not
,I wanna know how it feels to be lover you for real' till I do
,I keep writing songs about you
,And if you ever change your mind you want me back again
,I hope this song will remind me why I shouldn’t let you in
,I can’t wait for the day I’ll stop pretending that I’m really okay cause I’m not
,I wanna know how it feels to be lover you for real' till I do
,I just wait for the day I’ll stop pretending that I’m really okay when I’m not
,I wanna know how it feels to be lover you for real' till I do
,I keep writing songs about you.
,Taylor Swift-stupid boy
,Let me know how's it feel
,To be under my skin
,Wrapped around my heart
,Is it like anywhere you've been?
,And everything I do, I do it just for you
,So why the hell don't you love me?
,Why the hell don't you need me
,Like I need you?
,Why are you so far above me?
,Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
,But I was just a toy
,That's what you destroyed
,Stupid boy
,I have been, looking in
,Trying to read your mind
,Give you the benefit of the doubt
,Every single time
,But didn't you waltz right by
,I'm screamin' out inside
,Why the hell don't you love me?
,Why the hell don't you need me

,Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
,
,Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
,Baby, you were watching me
,Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
,Slowly educating me
,I never had a lesson so sweet
,
,You can get high on a first kiss
,You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
,You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
,Nothing's shatterproof
,You can crash and burn and come back someone new
,And that's what I learned from you
,
,Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
,Just like the two of us
,Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
,Guess I loved you way too much
,But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
,But it's still soft enough to cry
,Cause I remember those times
,
,You can get high on a first kiss
,You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
,You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
,Nothing's shatterproof
,You can crash and burn and come back someone new
,And that's what I learned from you
,
,Saw you just the other day
,All that I could think to say was,
,"Hey, how have you been?" Hey,
,You caught me with that old smile
,Said, "It's really been a while,
,And I still think about back when.."
,
,We used to get high on a first kiss

,all summer long

,An' then the time we woke up to find that
,summer'd gone
,But when you think: Tim McGraw,
,I hope you think my favorite song
,The one we danced to all night long:
,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
,When you think happiness,

,
,September saw a month of tears,
,An' thankin' God that you weren't here,

,Is a letter that you never read,

,
,It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,

,You said the way my blue eyes shined,
,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
,I said: "That's a lie"
,We used to walk along the streets
,When the porch lights were shining bright
,Before I had somewhere to be
,Back when we had all night
,And we were happy
,I do recall a good while back
,We snuck into the circus
,You threw your arms around my neck
,Back when I deserved it
,And we were happy
,When it was good baby,
,It was good baby
,We showed 'um all up
,No one could touch the way we
,Laughed in the dark
,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
,We were gonna buy someday
,And we were happy
,We used to watch the sun go down
,On the boats in the water
,That's sorta how I feel right now
,And Goodbye's so much harder
,Cause we were happy
,When it was good baby,
,It was good baby
,We showed 'um all up
,No one could touch the way we
,Laughed in the dark
,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
,We were gonna buy someday
,And we were happy
,Oh, I hate those voices
,Telling me I'm not in love anymore
,But they don't give me choices
,And that's what these tears are for\
,'Cause we were happy
,We Were Happy
,When it was good baby,
,It was good baby
,We showed 'um all up
,No one could touch the way we
,Laughed in the dark
,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
,And you were gonna marry me
,When we were happy
,Yeah, We were happy
,Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
,We Were happy...
,I heard a song tonight on the radio
,Another girl sings about a boy
,She see his face in every space every room
,And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
,If I close my eyes will you be there
,I don't wanna lose your face
,And I don't wanna wake up one day
,And not remember what time erased
,And I don't wanna turn around
,'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
,And I don't wanna lose your face
,I got a picture of you in my bedroom
,And I hope it never falls
,I hope I never lose that feeling
,I used to get whenever you'd call
,And now I wonder to myself
,Who were you where are you
,Were you ever here at all
,I don't wanna lose your face
,And I don't wanna wake up one day
,And not remember what time erased
,And I don't wanna turn around
,
,'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
,And I don't wanna lose your face
,The girl in the song had it so good
,I wish I could close my eyes and see you
,I wish the sky had your face
,And the oceans had your eyes
,And the sunset had your lips
,And I had you oh whoa yeah
,I don't wanna lose your face
,I don't wanna wake up one day
,And not remember what time erased
,And I don't wanna turn around
,'Cause I'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
,And I don't wanna lose your face
,Oh no no
,I don't wanna lose your face
,And I don't wanna turn around
,Oh oh oh ooh yeah
,Oh oh oh oh oh oh
,Oh oh oh yeah
,Beneath the chandelier
,The stars and atmosphere
,Tangle like the roots on the ground

,The windows open
,the wind is blowing and
,were both not making a sound

,
,give me a reason why we should ever move
,
,And tell me
,You'll never leave me
,
,That i'm not crazy
,And this is really happening
,that this is really happening
,
,Could this be better
,You write me letters
,Though you see me everyday
,you tend to treat me like
,my name is up in lights
,it really blows me away
,
,Light me up in a dark room
,
,And i still can't take my eyes off you
,And tell me
,
,You'll never leave me
,
,That i'm not crazy
,And this is really happening

,The calendar says July 4th, but it’s still winter in my heart

,The  tiptoes  on  the  bedroom  floor
,These  quiet  eyes  are  spinning  in  the  dark
,The  secret  wish  that  none  will  know
,She  keeps  it  locked  up  in  her  pale  heart
,Wait  for  it,it's  tired  and  it's  true
,Wait  for  it,it's  all  she  ever  knew
,She  dreams  in  blue
,Wait  for  it,it's  all  she  ever  knew
,The  background  hum  of  city  streets
,And  whispers  from  the  neighbors  intertwine
,The  distant  glow  of  beacon  lights  are
,Breaking  through  the  cracks  between  the  blinds
,Wait  for  it,it's  hiding  out  of  view
,Wait  for  it,it's  all  she  ever  knew
,She  dreams  in  blue
,Wait  for  it,it's  all  she  ever  knew
,She  opens  up  her  weary  eyes
,The  foggy  cloud  of  vision  fills  the  air
,She  strains  to  make  some  sense  of  all  the
,Abstract  shapes  and  colors  everywhere
,But  all  the  blue  just  fades  away  dissolving  in  a  haze  of  grey
,And  lost  inside  her  empty  mind  is  everything  she  tried  to  find
,And  all  the  blue  just  fades  away,she  lost  it  in  a  haze  of  grey
,She  dreams  in  blue
,Wait  for  it,it's  all  she  ever  knew

,How loud would I have to scream
,To make a sound, to let you know
,How tenderly would I have to whisper
,That's it's ok,that we can go
,But how cold the touch of you tongue
,Your weighted words make no sound
,But how violent must my loneliness become
,To burn my clothes,bury my crown
,Cos would it be enough for you to love me
,And would I be enough for you
,How reckless is the heart that bleeds for love
,That knows the warmth,that knows the taste
,And how blessed is the diamond in the rough
,Who would offer her embrace
,And how foolishly the lonely mind can wander
,And blinding lights falling down
,And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner
,So burn my clothes,and bury my crown
,Cos would it be enough for you to love me

,Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds?
,We would light up the sky when we'd fly
,You were orange and red like the sun when it sets
,I was green as an apple's eye
,
,You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing
,Like nothing that you'd ever heard
,And I said I loved you with all of my heart when
,We were two beautiful birds
,Remember when we were two beautiful birds
,We would sing when the morning would come
,You were silver and blue like the moon when it's new
,I was gold as a summer sun
,
,But one day you asked for a different song
,One that I just couldn't sing
,I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
,Those were the last days of spring
,
,To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests
,Like a book tearing out every page
,We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
,Into a beautiful cage

,All good things come to an end
,But I thought that this might last
,

,And when I'm awake I can't switch off
,It isn't the same but it is enough
,(It isn't the same but it is enough)
,I saw you in a dream
,Then it came tonight
,I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
,You take your time to reappear
,I'm starting to believe that when I call your name
,You just don't hear me anymore

,She got a name for May
,One day she may set herself free in May

,And let me sing for ever more
,You are all I long for

  Well I've been dreaming that we could sail away
 And I've been thinking that we could run away
 Darling take my hand let's leave this town behind
 It's us against the world and I want you by my side
 
 Tonight~ darling it's you and i
 Tonight~ we're holding up the sky
 
 I'd cross the stars and sail the seas
 If only it'd lead your love to me
 But darling without your hand in mine
 I won't find sleep tonight
 I'd cross the stars and sail the seas
 For you to be next to me
 
 Tonight~ darling it's you and i
 Tonight~ we're holding up the sky 

,Some expression in your eyes
,Overtook me by surprise
,Where was I ?
,How was I to know ?
,How can we drive to a movie show
,When the music is here in my car
,There's a band playing on the radio
,With a rhythm of rhyming guitars
,They're playing oh yeah on the radio
,And so it came to be our song
,And so on through all summer long
,Day and night drifting into love
,Driving you home from a movie show
,So in tune to the sounds in my car
,
,It's some time since we said goodbye
,And now we lead our separate lives
,But where am I ?
,Where can I go ?
,Driving alone to a movie show
,So I turn to the sounds in my car
,And it's drowning the sounds of my tears
,Through the alleyways
,To cool off in the shadows
,Then into the street
,Following the water
,There's a bearded man
,Paddling in his canoe
,Looks as if he has
,Come all the way from the Cayman Islands
,These canals, it seems
,They all go in circles
,Places look the same
,And we're the only difference
,The wind is in your hair
,It's covering my view
,I'm holding on to you
,On a bike we've hired until tomorrow
,
,If only they could see
,If only they had been here
,They would understand
,How someone could have chosen
,To go the length I've gone
,To spend just one day riding
,Holding on to you
,I never thought it would be this clear

,I  don't  know  if  I  can  do  this  alone
,Oh  after  all  our  sweet  love  is  flown
,I've  been  a  running

,And  I  don't  know  if  I
,I  can  do  this  all  alone
,When  I  met  her  she  was  standing  by  a  door
,I  ain't  never  seen  a  light  like  that  before
,Now  she's  left  me  for  something  more  sure
,And  I  don't  know  if  I
,I  can  do  this  anymore

,and throwing up a little of dust
,Like a pick up truck does in the mud
,But ain't nobody slowing us down right now
,
,I used to spend my nights out
,In a bar room
,Liquor was the only love I'd known
,But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
,And brought me back from being too far gone
,You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey
,You're as sweet as strawberry wine
,You're as warm as a glass of Brandy
,And I stay stoned on your love all the time
,
,I looked for love
,In all the same old places
,Found the bottom of the bottle's
,Always dry
,But when you poured out your heart
,I didn't waste it
,Cause there's nothing like your love
,To get me high
,You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey
,You're as sweet as strawberry wine
,You're as warm as a glass of Brandy
,Honey I stay stoned on your love all the time

,19 You + Me - Dan and Shay
,It was our first week, at Myrtle beach
,
,Where it all began
,
,It was a 102, nothin' to do
,Man it was hot, so we jumped in
,
,We were summertime sippin', sippin'
,
,Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
,T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
,How could I forget?
,
,Watchin' that blonde hair swing
,To every song I'd sing
,
,You were California beautiful
,
,I was playin' everything but cool
,I can still hear that sound
,Of every wave crashin' down
,
,Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
,
,It was everything we wanted it to be
,The summer of 19 you and me
,
,We had our first dance in the sand
,It was one hell of a souvenir
,
,Tangled up, so in love
,You said, let's just stay right here
,
,Till the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
,Right then I knew
,
,Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
,
,When I looked at you

, 作曲 : Robson, Steele
,I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
,That don’t bother me
,I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
,I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
,Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
,There are days every now and again I pretend I’m ok
,But that’s not what gets me
,What hurts the most
,Was being so close
,And having so much to say
,And watching you walk away
,And never knowing
,What could have been
,And not seeing that loving you
,Is what I was trying to do
,It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
,But I’m doin’it
,It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
,Still Harder
,Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret
,But I know if I could do it over
,I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
,That I left unspoken
,What hurts the most
,Is being so close
,And having so much to say
,And watching you walk away
,And never knowing
,What could have been
,And not seeing that loving you
,Is what I was trying to do （oh`````）

,
,
,I set out on a narrow way many years ago
,Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
,But I got lost a time or two
,Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
,I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
,Every long lost dream led me to where you are
,Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
,Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
,This much I know is true
,That God blessed the broken road
,That led me straight to you
,I think about the years I spent just passing through
,I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
,But you just smile and take my hand
,You've been there you understand
,It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
,Every long lost dream led me to where you are
,Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
,Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
,This much I know is true
,That God blessed the broken road
,That led me straight to you
,Now I am just rollin?home into my lover's arms
,This much I know is true
,That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
,I don't know if you were looking at me or not
,You probably smile like that all the time
,And I don't mean to bother you but
,I couldn't just walk by
,And not say hi
,And I know your name
,Cuz everybody in here knows your name
,And you're not looking for anything right now
,So I don't wanna come on strong
,But don't get me wrong
,Your eyes are so intimidating
,My heart is pounding but
,It's just a conversation
,No girl I'm not gunna waste it
,You don't know me
,I don't know you but I want to
,I don't wanna steal your freedom
,I don't wanna change your mind
,I don't have to make you love me
,I just want to take your time
,I don't wanna wreck your Friday
,I ain't gunna waste my lies
,I don't have to take your heart
,I just wanna take your time
,And I know it starts with hello
,And the next thing you know your trying to be nice
,And some guys getting too close
,Tryin to pick you up
,Trying to get you drunk
,And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
,Cuz she's supposed to save you from random guys
,That talk to much and wanna stay too long
,It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
,Told me to go to hell
,Coulda walked away
,But your still here
,And I'm still here
,Come on let's see where it goes
,I don't wanna steal your freedom
,I don't wanna change your mind
,I don't have to make you love me
,I just wanna take your time
,I don't have to meet your mother
,We don't have to cross that line
,I don't wanna steal your covers
,I just wanna take your time
,I don't wanna go home with you
,I just wanna be alone with you
,I don't wanna steal your freedom
,I don't wanna change your mind
,I don't have to make you love me
,I just wanna take your time
,I don't wanna blow your phone up
,I just wanna blow your mind
,I don't have to take your heart
,I just wanna take your time
,No, I ain't gotta call you baby
,And I ain't gotta call you mine
,I don't have to take your heart
,I just wanna take your time
,They roll the sidewalks in this town
,All up after the sun goes down
,They say nothin' good happens here
,When midnight rolls around
,But layin' down would be in vain
,I can't sleep with you on my brain
,And I ain't anywhere close to tired
,Your kiss has got me wired
,Girl, you got the beat right,
,killin' in your Levis
,High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
,It's still early out in Cali, baby,
,don't you wanna rally again
,We'll find a road with no name,
,lay back in the slow lane
,The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
,We'll be rolling down the windows,
,I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
,We don't have to go home,
,we can leave the night on
,We can leave the night on
,Now all the stars are turnin' blue
,Just kissed the clock 2:22
,Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
,I'm wishin' for it too
,Now all the lights are flashin' gold
,Nobody cares how fast we go
,Our soundtrack's in the stereo
,This DJ's on a roll

,You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi

,It was so nice throwing big parties
,Jumping to the pool from the balcony
,Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
,And there are no rules when you show up here
,Bass beat rattling the chandelier
,Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
,So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
,I'm shaking my head
,I'm locking the gates
,This is why we can't have nice things, darling

,There I was, giving you a second chance
,But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand
,And therein lies the issue
,Friends don't try to trick you
,Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
,And so I took an axe to a mended fence
,But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
,If only you weren't so shady

,They don't care about that he-said-she-said
,And here's to my baby
,He ain't reading what they call me lately
,And here's to my momma
,Had to listen to all this drama
,And here's to you
,'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
,Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

,There I was again tonight
,Forcing laughter,faking smiles
,Same old tired,lonely place.
,Walls of insincerity
,Shifting eyes and vacancy
,Vanished when I saw your face.
,All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you.
,Your eye's whispered "have we met?"
,Across the room your silhouette
,Starts to make its way to me.
,The playful conversation starts
,Counter all your quick remarks
,Like passing notes in secrecy.
,And it was enchanting to meet you.
,All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you.
,This night is sparkling,don't you let it go
,I'm wonderstruck,blushing all the way home
,I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
,I was enchanted to meet you.
,The lingering question kept me up
,2am,
,who do you love?
,I wonder till i'm wide awake.
,Now i'm pacing back and fourth
,Wishing you were at my door.
,I'd open up and you would say,
,hey ，It was enchanted to meet you.
,All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.
,This night is sparkling,don't you let it go
,I'm wonderstruck,blushing all the way home
,I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
,This night is flawless,don't you let it go
,I'm wonderstruck,dancing around all alone
,I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
,I was enchanted to meet you.
,This is me praying
,That this was the very first page.
,Not where the story line ends.
,My thoughts will echo your name
,Untill I see you again.
,These are the words I held back
,As I was leaving to soon.I was enchanted to meet you.

,Long were the nights
,When my days once revolved around you
,Counting my footsteps
,Praying the floor won't fall through  again
,My mother accused me of losing my mind
,but I swore I was fine
,You paint me a blue sky
,And go back and turn it to rain
,And I lived in your chess game
,but you changed the rules every day
,Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
,Tonight
,Well I stopped picking up
,And this song is to let you know why
,Dear John
,I see it all now that you're gone
,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
,The girl in the dress
,Cried the whole way home
,I should've known
,Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
,Maybe it's you and your sick
,Need to give love then take it away
,And you'll add my name to your long list
,Of traitors who don't understand
,And I'll look back and regret how I ignored
,When they said run as fast as you can
,Dear John
,I see it all now that you're gone
,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
,The girl in the dress
,Cried the whole way home
,Dear John
,I see it all  now it was wrong
,Don't you think 19 is too young to be played
,By your dark twisted games  when I loved you so
,I should've known
,You are an expert at sorry
,and keeping lines blurry
,Never impressed by me acing your tests
,All the girls that you run dry
,with tired  lifeless eyes
,cause you burned them out
,But I took your matches before fire could catch me
,So don't look now
,I'm shining like fireworks over your sad  empty town

,I still remember the look on your face
,Lit through the darkness at 1:58
,The words that you whispered
,For just us to know
,You told me you loved me
,So why did you go
,Away?
,Away
,I do recall now
,The smell of the rain
,Fresh on the pavement
,I ran off the plane
,That July 9th
,The beat of your heart
,It jumps through your shirt
,I can still feel your arms
,But now I'll go sit on the floor
,Wearing your clothes
,All that I know is that
,I don't know how to be something you miss
,Never thought we'd have a last kiss
,I never imagined we'd end like this
,Your name, forever the name on my lips
,I do remember
,The swing in your step
,The life of the party, you're showing off again
,And I roll my eyes and then
,You pull me in
,I'm not much for dancing
,But for you I did
,Because I love your handshake
,Me and my father
,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
,How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
,There's not a day when I don't miss those rude interruptions
,And I'll go sit on the floor
,Wearing your clothes
,All that I know is that
,I don't know how to be something you miss
,Never thought we'd have a last kiss
,I never imagined we'd end like this
,Your name, forever the name on my lips
,Ooh whoo
,So I'll watch you live in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
,And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
,Hope it's nice where you are
,And I hope the sun shines
,And it's a beautiful day
,And something reminds you
,You wish you had stayed
,You can plan for a change in weather and town
,But I never planned on you changing your mind
,So I'll go sit on the floor
,Wearing your clothes
,All that I know is that
,I don't know how to be something you miss
,Never thought we'd have a last kiss
,I never imagined we'd end like this
,Your name, forever the name on my lips

,Hey it's me leave a message, make it hot!
,Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
,I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
,She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
,She took him faster than you can say sabotage
,I never saw it coming, wouldn't have I suspected it

,There is nothing I do better than revenge
,Ha!
,She looks her life like it's a party and she's on the list
,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
,She thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
,But sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
,Or pushing people down and get you where you wanna go
,They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
,That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
,Think about what you did
,She's not a saint and she's not what you think

,You might have him, but haven't you heard
,I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
,You might have him, but I always get the last word

,Uh, uh, uh oh
,You were in college working part time waiting tables
,Left a small town, never looked back
,I was the flight risk with the fear of fallin'
,Wonderin' why we bothered with love if it never lasts
,I say "Can you believe it?"
,As we're lying on the couch
,The moment I can see it
,Yes, yes I can see it now
,Do you remember we were sittin' there by the water?
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
,You learned my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
,But we've got bills to pay
,We got nothing figured out
,When it was hard to take yes, yes
,This is what I thought about
,Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
,You put your arm around me for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Do you remember all the city lights on the water
,You saw me start to believe for the first time
,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
,Oh whoa!
,I remember that fight 2:30 AM
,As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
,I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
,Braced myself for the goodbye
,Cause that's all I've ever known
,And you took me by surprise
,You said "I'll never leave you alone"
,Uh, uh, uh oh
,You said
,"I remember how we felt sittin' by the water
,And every time I look at you it's like the first time
,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
,She is the best thing that's ever been mine..."
,Hold on, make it last
,Hold on, Never turn back
,Hold on You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
,Hold on You are the best thing that's ever been mine...

,An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
,Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
,When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows, he saw
,Plowed through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
,Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
,Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath you could feel
,A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
,For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
,Yipie I oh, yipie I ay, ghost riders in the sky
,Their face is gaunt, their eyes were blurred
,Their shirts all soaked with sweat
,He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he 'ain't caught 'em yet
,'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
,On horses snorting fire as they ride on, hear them cry
,As the riders leaned on by him, he heard one call his name
,If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
,Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
,Tryin' to catch the devil herd across these endless skies
,Yipie I oh, yipie I ay, ghost riders in the sky
,Ghost riders in the sky, ghost riders in the sky

,
,Nobody else could miss her not half as much as me
,She cried so when I left her It like to broke my heart
,And if I ever find her we nevermore will part
,She's the sweetest little rosebud that texas ever knew
,Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
,You may talk about your clementine and sing of rosalee
,But the yellow rose of texas beats the belles of tennessee
,
,When the rio grande is flowing the starry skies are bright
,We walks along the river in the quiet summer night
,She said if you remembers when we parted long ago
,I promise to return again and not to leave her so
,She's the sweetest little rosebud that texas ever knew
,Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
,You may talk about your clementine and sing of rosalee
,But the yellow rose of texas beats the belles of tennessee
,
,I'm going to find her for my heart is full of woe
,And we'll sing the songs together that we sung so long ago
,We'll play the bango gaily and we'll sing the songs of yore
,And the yellow rose of texas shall be mine forevermore

There's nothin' like cornmeal on a dance-hall floor
for dancin' the night away,
Slippin' and slidin', effortlessly glidin' in the arms
of my sweet Lillie Mae,
So I shined up my boots and ironed my shirt,
and pulled on some new blue jeans.
Oh, I brushed off my hat, slicked back my hair; I'll
beat all that she's ever seen.
There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.
Way out on Ranch Road 17 there's a dance hall in the live-oak trees,
Yellow lights strung up all around, so all the little kids can see.
Pickups are parked near to the road; the beer is so cold it might freeze.
Stars are all out, the band's in tune,
and it smells like a barbecue breeze.
There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Doin' the cornmeal waltz.
Beat-up old Stetsons, beehive hair, belt buckles bumpin' in time.
There's little girls dancin' on their daddies' toes,
spinnin' around on a dime.
Grandma and Grandpa are out on the floor,
dancin' like they've lost their minds.
There's old maids and bachelors and sweethearts alike,
all movin' in three-quarter time.
There's nothin' like listenin' to the fiddles play
While doin' the cornmeal waltz.
There's nothin' to keep you from driftin' away,
Just doin' the cornmeal waltz.

Everybody's looking
You're the talk all over town
When y'all walk the street
He's got a smile you got a frown
Too many folks talking about what you ought to do
And not what you gonna do
Still ain't right for that man to get on top of you
That boy don't love, he's afraid of you
We heard he slapped you around
And I know that shit ain't right
One minute y'all get along
And then the next you fuss and fight
Sugar wouldn't melt in his mouth according to you
Next day we see you girl you all black and blue
That boy don't love, he's afraid of you
Now your moments come
You've got to break out on your own
Girl you can't live in fear
Inside that place you call your home
It's time to turn him out turn him loose just walk away
He's just a mama's boy let him cry girl, let him cry
That boy don't love, he's afraid of you
That boy don't love, he's afraid of you

,All the tears away
,All the pain away
,（Music......）
,Everytime I'm blue
,I take my feeling
,I hold it tighter
,And I don't let go
,When the sky gets whiter
,And the air is colder
,I throw my feeling
,To the falling snow
,But
,When hearts are breaking
,There's not enough snow to carry all the blues away
,Everytime my heart
,My heart starts breaking
,I take this pain
,And I hold it down
,And I wait for the wailing
,When the wind is comin'
,And my pain is blowin'
,Through another town
,Fade out ......

,She is gone but she was here
,And her presence is still heavy in the air
,Oh, what a taste of human love
,Now she's gone and it don't matter anymore
,Passing dreams in the night
,It was more than just a woman and a man
,It was love without disguise the sky's
,And now my life will never be the same again

,It's another tequila sunrise
,Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye
,He was just a hired hand
,Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
,The days go by
,Ev'ry night when the sun goes down
,Just another lonely boy in town
,And she's out runnin' 'round
,She wasn't just another woman
,And I couldn't keep from comin' on
,It's been so long
,Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when
,It comes down to dealin' friends
,It never ends
,Take another shot of courage
,Wonder why the right words never come
,You just get numb
,It's another tequila sunrise,this old world
,still looks the same,
,Another frame, mm...

,あなたがくれた
,この名前は
,いくつの願い
,込められてるの
,そこから見える
,わたしの素顔は
,誇れるものですか
,
,あんなに嫌いで
,飛び出した故郷
,
,家族の声も
,ただ重くて
,苛立っていたよ
,
,そんな姿は
,あなたからすれば
,泣き続けた幼子の頃と
,変わりはなく
,
,いくつになっても同じだと
,子供扱いするばかりで
,認めてくれる言葉もないまま
,会えなくなるなんて...
,
,年に一度の誕生日だから
,照れずに言うよ
,「産んでくれて、ありがとう」
,
,あなたがくれたこの心は
,やさしい人を選びました
,自分じゃなくて
,家族の笑顔を　願ってる人
,
,いつか　会ってください
,
,真白な百合を
,写真に飾ろう
,
,聞いてもいいかな
,認めてくれるかな
,この生き方を
,
,
,
,黄昏に染まる街 そんな季節 切なくて
,この頬に ひとつこぼれ落ちた涙のあと
,
,君が描いた夢の中で
,僕は生きることが出来ず…
,
,恋人よ もうあの頃は 眩しい光の中
,恋人よ もう抱きしめることなど
,出来ないのに
,なくしても まだ忘れられぬ
,君のぬくもりが 消えなくて
,
,さよならを言葉にせず 恋の終り迷わせた
,やさしさの意味さえも 知らない僕がいた
,
,あの日 君より傷つくのが
,僕は怖かった とても…
,
,恋人よ もうあの頃は 眩しい光の中
,恋人よ もう名も知らぬ 誰かを愛してるの
,逢えないと わかっているから
,君にとても 今 逢いたくて
,
,恋人よ もうあの頃は 眩しい光の中
,恋人よ もう抱きしめることなど
,出来ないのに

,
,
,
,
,忧伤黑夜太漫长
,哪段前往梦想之航不起浪
,就算失去方向 只有孤单陪伴
,用力微笑吧不会太难
,勇气就如同今晚沉默月光
,期待再一次被照亮
,因为害怕被击垮而轻言放弃
,那才是真的所谓失败啊
,就像太阳燃烧吧
,直到冰冷世界有温暖
,你将会看到希望
,人生不可思议吧
,夜越是黑暗星光就越是璀璨
,少了你的关怀 哪怕实现了梦
,再感到光荣也是心痛
,真心就如同今晚遥远的星光
,在黑暗中闪耀着光芒
,不论困难或悲伤都一起分享
,再苦也能勇敢地飞翔
,像太阳尽情燃烧吧
,为了照亮彼此而存在
,当还能为梦想而战
,希望就如同今晚微小的星光啊
,为迷路的人指引方向
,看似可笑的脆弱对我们来说
,却是唯一支撑的力量
,就像太阳燃烧吧
,直到冰冷世界有温暖
,你就是我的希望
,我也将守护着你
,默默努力为你燃烧
,太阳将再度升起
,不管谁变勇敢谁仍旧沮丧
,住在这星球上筑梦的人们啊
,闪亮的一天正当要开始

,君も见てるかな
,君に逢いたいな
,いま以上自分以上に
,なりたかったんだよ
,急いで急いで…
,胜つために覚えたこと
,この街のルールに
,少しだけ染まったよ
,お愿いだ
,涙は隠「かく」さないでくれ
,お愿いだ
,心は失くさないでくれ
,ほらごらん一绪にさがしてた
,明日に仆はまだ走ってるんだよ
,东京にもあったんだ
,こんなキレイな夜空が
,おかしいね
,涙こぼれてる
,君に逢いたいな
,ときどき忙しすぎて
,仆に迷ったり
,君にも怒ったり
,生きるために伤付くこと
,この街のルールに
,もう少し逆らうよ
,お愿いだ涙は隠「かく」さないでくれ
,お愿いだ心は失くさないでくれ
,ありがとう一绪に泣いてくれた
,君はね青春のゴールだったよ
,ねえ　わかってたんだよ

,「100年経っても好きでいてね」
,みんなの前で困らせたり
,
,それでも隣で笑ってくれて
,選んでくれてありがとう
,
,どれほど深く信じ合っても
,わからないこともあるでしょう
,その孤独と寄り添い生きることが
,「愛する」ということかもしれないから…
,
,いつかお父さんみたいに大きな背中で
,いつかお母さんみたいに静かな優しさで
,どんなことも越えてゆける 家族になろうよ
,
,小さな頃は身体が弱くて
,すぐに泣いて甘えてたの
,
,いつも自分のことばかり精一杯で
,親孝行なんて出来てないけど
,
,明日のわたしはそれほど
,変われないとしても
,一歩ずつ 与えられる人から
,与える人へかわってゆけたなら
,
,いつかおじいちゃんみたいに無口な強さで
,いつかおあばちゃんみたいに可愛い笑顔で
,あなたとなら生きてゆける そんなふたりになろうよ
,
,いつかあなたの笑顔によく似た 男の子と
,いつかわたしとおなじ泣き虫な 女の子と
,どんなことも越えてゆける 家族になろうよ
,
,あなたとなら生きてゆける
,しあわせになろうよ

,有些人用一辈子去学习
,化解沟通的难题
,为你我也可以
,我的快乐与恐惧猜疑
,很想都翻译成言语
,带你进我心底
,我们就像隔着一层玻璃
,看得见却触不及
,虽然我离你几毫米
,你不会知道我有多着急
,无心的坐视不理
,我尴尬的沉默里
,泪水在滴
,我无法传达我自己
,从何说起
,要如何翻译我爱你
,寂寞不已
,我也想能与你搭起桥梁
,建立默契
,却词不达意
,在你的盲点里寸步不移
,不论天晴或下雨
,陪着你悲伤欢喜
,你难道从来不觉得好奇
,你身旁冷清拥挤
,我一直在这里
,不说一句
,我无法传达我自己
,从何说起
,要如何翻译我爱你

,我都寂寞多久了还是没好
,感觉全世界都在窃窃嘲笑
,我能有多骄傲 不堪一击好不好
,一碰到你我就被撂倒
,吵醒沉睡冰山后从容脱逃
,你总是有办法轻易做到
,一个远远的微笑
,就掀起汹涌波涛
,又闻到眼泪沸腾的味道
,明明你也很爱我
,没理由爱不到结果
,只要你敢不懦弱
,凭什么我们要错过
,夜长梦还多
,你就不要想起我
,到时候你就知道有多痛
,那些快乐多难得美好
,你真的有办法舍得不要
,才刚成真的美梦
,转眼就幻灭破掉
,祝福你真的可以睡得好
,明明你也最爱我
,没理由爱不到结果
,只要你敢不懦弱
,凭什么我们要错过
,夜长梦很多
,你就不要想起我
,到时候最好别来要认错
,你就不要 想我到 疯掉
,明明你也还爱我
,没理由爱不到结果
,只要你敢不懦弱
,凭什么我们要错过
,夜长梦会多
,你就不要想起我
,我等夜监听你说多爱我

,Look out
,This thing is gonna blow
,I heard it from the people in the know
,There's trouble in the tenements below
,There's fire where the flowers used to grow
,I'm never going back
,I'm running from the sun
,Bullets at my heels
,The devil's got a gun
,I'm never going home
,I'll be the only one
,With daylight on my tail
,And heaven on the run
,Rain is jumping up into the clouds
,A girl has ceased to make her father proud
,Lovers wrapped up in cellophane
,The bitter fruit has fallen from its prey
,I'm never going back
,I'm running from the sun
,Bullets at my heels
,The devil's got a gun
,I'm never going home
,I'll be the only one
,With daylight on my tail
,And heaven on the run
,Help me I know not what I see
,I'm a stranger to the face looking back at me
,When the company of sisters is just like any mystery to me
,Hold me I know not who I am
,If I'm a woman you're a creature not a man
,The eyes of a lover
,They look like any other to me
,It's down to the second hand
,The tick tock is more than you can stand
,The grinders and the wheels they never sleep
,We're fighting to the bottom of the deep
,I'm never going back
,I'm running from the sun
,Bullets at my heels
,The devil's got a gun
,I'm never going home
,I'll be the only one
,With daylight on my tail
,And heaven on the run
,Daylight on my tail
,And heaven on the run

,每当黄昏阳光把所有都渲染
,我看到夜的黑暗
,晚风吹过金色沙滩海边的晚宴
,那种味道现在还不习惯
,
,拉斯维加斯往返的路上我看见
,这里无人烟无人烟

,旁人在 淡出终于只有你共我一起
,仍然自问幸福虽说有阵时为你生气
,其实以前和你互相不懂得死心塌地
,直到共你渡过多灾世纪
,即使身边世事再毫无道理 与你永远亦连在一起
,你不放下我 我不放下你
,我想确定每日挽着同样的手臂
,不敢早死要来陪住你 我已试够别离并不很凄美
,我还如何撇下你
,年华像细水冲走几个爱人与知己
,抬头命运射灯光柱罩下来是我跟你

,证明爱人又爱己 何以要那么悲壮才合理
,即使身边世事再毫无道理 与你永远亦连在一起
,你不放下我 我不放下你
,我想确定每日挽着同样一双臂
,不必挑选我们成大器
,当我两个并无冒险的福气
,见尽了 云涌风起 还怎么舍得放下你
,我们仍珍惜这啖气

,再给我看看你受伤的尾巴
,我不想去触碰你伤口的疤
,我只想掀起你的头发
,斑马斑马 你回到了你的家
,可我浪费着我寒冷的年华
,你的城市没有一扇门为我打开啊
,我终究还要回到路上
,斑马斑马，你来自南方的红色啊
,是否也是个动人的故事啊
,你隔壁的戏子如果不能留下
,谁会和你睡到天亮
,斑马斑马 你还记得我吗
,我是只会歌唱的傻瓜
,斑马斑马 你睡吧睡吧
,我会背上吉他离开北方
,斑马斑马 你会记得我吗
,我是强说着忧愁的孩子啊
,斑马斑马 你睡吧睡吧

,Disappearing when you wake up
,But there's nothing to be afraid of
,Even when the night changes
,It will never change me and you
,Going out tonight
,Changes into something red
,Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
,Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
,We're only getting older, baby
,And I've been thinking about it lately
,Does it ever drive you crazy
,Just how fast the night changes?
,Everything that you've ever dreamed of
,Disappearing when you wake up
,But there's nothing to be afraid of
,Even when the night changes
,It will never change, baby
,It will never change, baby
,It will never change me and you

,You had to kill the conversation
,You always had the upper hand
,Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
,You had to go and ruin all our plans
,Packed your bags and you're leaving home
,Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
,But we have one more day together, so
,Love me like there's no tomorrow
,Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
,This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
,But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
,I guess we drift alone in separate ways
,I don't have all that far to go
,God knows I learnt to play the lonely man
,I've never felt so low in all my life
,We were born to be just losers
,So I guess there's a limit on how far we go
,But we only have one more day together so
,Love me like there's no tomorrow
,Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
,This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
,But today just love me like there's no tomorrow
,Tomorrow god knows just where I'll be
,Tomorrow who knows just what's in store for me
,Anything can happen but we only have one more day together, yeah
,Just one more day forever, so
,Love me like there's no tomorrow
,Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
,This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
,But today just love me like there's no tomorrow , so
,Love me like there's no tomorrow
,Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
,This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
,But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

,Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
,On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame
,Turning and returning to some secret place inside
,Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say
,Take my breath away
,Take my breath away
,Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love
,Never hesitating to become the fated ones
,Turning and returning to some secret place to hide
,Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
,Take my breath away
,Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away
,When the mirror crashed I called you, and turned to hear you say
,If only for today I am unafraid
,Take my breath away
,Take my breath away
,Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
,Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
,Turning and returning to some secret place inside
,Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say
,Take my breath away
,My love, take my breath away
,My love, take my breath away
,Take My Breath Away
,My Love
,In the spring we made a boat
,out of feathers, out of bones.
,We set fire to our homes,
,walking barefoot in the snow.
,Distant rhythm of the drum
,as we drifted towards the storm.
,Baby lion lost his teeth,
,now they're swimming in the sea.
,
,Troubled spirits on my chest
,where they laid to rest.
,The birds all left my tall friend
,as your body hit the sand.
,Million stars up in the sky
,formed a tigers eye
,
,that looked down on my face,
,out of time and out of place.
,So hold on,
,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,
,Awaken by the sound
,of a screaming owl.
,Chasing leafs in the wind,
,going where we've never been.
,Said goodbye to you my friend,
,as the fire spread.
,All that's left are your bones
,that will soon sink like stones
,So hold on,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,Where do I begin
,To tell the story of how great a love can be
,The sweet love story that is older than the sea
,The simple truth about the love she brings to me
,Where do I start
,With her first hello
,She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
,There'd never be another love, another time
,She came into my life and made the living fine
,She fills my heart
,She fills my heart with every special things
,With angel songs, with wild imaginings
,She fills my soul with so much love
,That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
,With her along who could be lonely
,I reach for her hand, it's always there
,How long does it last
,Can love be measured by the hours in a day
,I have no answers now but this much I can say
,I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
,And she'll be there
,How long does it last
,Can love be measured by the hours in a day
,I have no answers now but this much I can say
,I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
,And she'll be there
,By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
,ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion
,
,By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down
,ye-eah we wept, when we remembered Zion
,When the wicked
,Carried us away in captivity
,Require from us a song
,Now how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land
,When the wicked
,Carried us away in captivity
,Requiring of us a song
,Now how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land
,Let the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts
,be acceptable in Thy sight here tonight

,By the rivers of Babylon the waters of Babylon
,there we sat down You got to sing a song
,ye-eah we wept, Sing a song of love
,when we remember Zion. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
,By the rivers of Babylon by the rivers of Babylon
,there we sat down You hear the people cry
,ye-eah we wept, They need their God
,when we remember Zion. Ooh, got the power
,I want to live,
,I want to give
,I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
,It's these expressions I never give
,That keep me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old.
,And I'm getting old.
,
,
,I've been to Hollywood
,I've been to Redwood
,I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
,I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
,That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old.
,Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
,And I'm getting old.
,Keep me searching for a heart of gold
,You keep me searching for a heart of gold

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
The happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line 

,You ask me if I love you
,And I choke on my reply
,I'd rather hurt you honestly
,Than mislead you with a lie
,For who am I to judge you
,
,In what you say or do
,
,I'm only just beginning
,To see the real you
,
,And sometimes when we touch
,
,The honesty's too much
,
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,
,Romance's an honest strategy
,Leaves me grappling with my pride
,
,But through the years of maturity
,Some tenderness survives
,I'm just another writer
,Still trapped within my truth
,A hesitant prize-fighter
,Still trapped within my youth
,
,And sometimes when we touch
,The honesty's too much
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
,
,At times I'd like to break you
,And drive you to your knees
,At times I'd like to break through
,And hold you endlessly
,
,At times I understand you
,And I know how hard you try
,
,I've watched whil love commands you
,
,And I've watched love pass you by
,
,At times I think we're drifters
,
,Still searching for a friend
,
,A brother or a sister
,
,But then the passion flares again....
,
,And sometimes when we touch
,
,The honesty's too much
,
,And I have to close my eyes
,And hide
,
,I wanna hold you till I die
,Till we both break down and cry
,I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
Last night 
I saw Lester 
Maddox on a 
TV showWith some smart ass 
New York Jew
And the Jew laughed at 
Lester Maddox
And the audience laughed at 
Lester Maddox too
Well, he may be a fool but he's our fool
If they think they're better than him, they're wrong
So I went to the park and 
I took some paper along
And that's where 
I made this song
We talk real funny down here
We drink too much and we laugh too loud
We're too dumb to make it no 
Northern town
We keepin' the niggers down
We got no-necked oilmen from 
TexasAnd good ol' boys from 
TennesseeAnd college men from 
L.S.U.Went in dumb, come out dumb too
Hustlin' 'round 
Atlanta in their alligator shoes
Gettin' drunk every weekend at the barbecues
We keepin' the niggers down
We're rednecks, we're rednecks
We don't know our ass from a hole in the ground
We're rednecks, we're rednecks
We keepin' the niggers down
Now your northern nigger's a 
NegroYou see, he's got his dignity
Down here we're too ignorant to realize
That the North has set the nigger free
Yes, he's free to be put in a cage in 
Harlem in 
New York City
And he's free to be put in a cage
In the South-
Side of Chicago, the 
West-SideAnd he's free to be put in a cage in 
Hough in Cleveland
And he's free to be put in a cage in 
East St. Louis
And he's free to be put in a cage in 
Fillmore in 
San Francisco
And he's free to be put in a cage in 
Roxbury in 
BostonThey're gatherin' 'em up from miles around
Keepin' the niggers down
We're rednecks, we're rednecks
We don't know our ass from a hole in the ground
We're rednecks, we're rednecks
We keepin' the niggers down
We are keepin' the niggers down

Married at 16, 2 kids by 21 
But he couldn't take it, now she's raisin' them on her own 
Between the bills & the laundry, sometimes she's so lonely she cries 
But she's found an escape from some of the achin' inside (Chorus:) 
She's got a radio heart 
She loves the songs they play, they take him off her mind 
She's got a radio heart 
It helps fill an empty space he left behind 
She gets lost in a steel guitar 
Oh it's her way out when the heartache starts 
She's found a little salvation in a local station 
She's got a radio heart 
She'll finish clearin' the table & put the kids off to bed 
She tries to watch an old movie, but she thinks of him instead 
She lies alone in the dark & stares at the lighted dial 
She gets into the music & out of this world for a while (chorus) 
She's got a radio heart

Funny how the circle turns around
First you're up and then you're down again
Though the circle takes what it may give
Each time around it makes it live again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight
And if it's right, it brings it back again
Funny how the circle turns around
You think you're lost and then you're found again
Though you always look for what you know
Each time around it's something new again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight
And if it's right, it brings it back again
Funny how the circle is a wheel
And it can steal someone who is a friend
Funny how the circle takes your flight
And if it's right, it brings it back again

The River Unbroken
Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My god, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes i feel i can't go on, i can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, i get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, my strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow

If you've got a problem, I don't care what it is
If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothing new
But a woman like you baby, should never have the blues
Let me help, I've got two for me, let me help

Let me help
When I go to sleep at night
You're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything
I want to hear
Don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help, if your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
When I go to sleep at night
You're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything
I want to hear
Don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help, if your child needs a daddy, I can help

1. i've had bad dreams too many times,
To think that they don't mean much any more.
Fine times have gone and left my sad home,
Friends who once cared just walk out my door.
Chorus:
Love has no pride when i call out your name.
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame.
I'd give anything to see you again.
2. i've been alone too many nights
To think that you could come back again.
But i've heard you talk: "she's crazy to stay."
But this love hurts me so, i don't care what you say.
Repeat chorus
Bridge:
If i could buy your love, i'd truly try my friend.
And if i could pray, my prayer would never end.
But if you want me to beg, i'll fall down on my kneews;
Asking for you to come back...
I'd be pleading for you to come back...
Beggin for you to come back to me.
Repeat chorus
Tag line:
Yes, i'd give anything to see you again.
Last night 
I dreamedAn angel came
He took my hand
He called my name
He bid me look
The other way
I saw a man
I heard him say
He said if 
I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then
I saw the nail-scared hand
That bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment
That fell round him there
My life, my heart, 
I gaveMy soul was in his care
When I awoke
My heart beat so
And in the dark
I saw a glow
This was no dream
He turned my way
Again I heard
My Saviour say
He said if 
I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then
I saw the nail-scared hand
That bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment
That fell 'round him there
My life, my heart, 
I gaveMy soul was in his care(In his care)
If i had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if i had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat
If i were roy rogers
I'd sure enough be single
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old dale
It'd just be me and trigger
We'd go riding through them movies
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail
And if i had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if i had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat
The mystery masked man was smart
He got himself a tonto
'cause tonto did the dirty work for free
But tonto he was smarter
And one day said kemo sabe
Kiss my ass i bought a boat
I'm going out to sea
And if i had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if i had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat
And if i were like lightning
I wouldn't need no sneakers
I'd come and go wherever i would please
And i'd scare 'em by the shade tree
And i'd scare 'em by the light pole
But i would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea
And if i had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if i had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

,Rose garden filled with thorns
,Keep you second guessing like oh my god
,Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy

,
,So this next clip is
,Uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback
,And what we like to do
,Is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we were doing
,When we were putting a song together
,Just in case one of us blurs out a cool melody and then we forget about it
,And we want to go back and then
,And replay the tapes so that we could remind ourselves of what exactly we were saying
,Um, so I've brought in this idea called "Blank Space"
,And this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time
,And they are shouting out these production ideas like...
,You know, the "Oh" in the beginning of a chorus
,And that ended up in this song
,So this is the very beginning stages of this song on the album called "Blank Space"
,
,Nice to meet you, where you been
,I could show you incredible things
,Diamonds, seasides...
,...
,Oh my god..
,...I do too
,...
,...
,All you think about this time
,...
,Oh my god...
,...What you heard about me
,Can't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
,'Cause it's gonna be forever
,Gonna go
,Yeah, haha...
,Ey, ey
,Gonna go down in flames
,You can tell me when it's over
,(This is like, this is like a(n) early 2000's Nelly track, no)
,Got a long list of ex lovers
,Got a long list of ex lovers
,Tell you I'm insane
,But I've got a blank space, baby
,I'll write your name
,Blank space baby
,I'll write your name
,Haha...
,Yeah
,Midnight, you come and pick me up
, no headlight
,Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
,Fade into view, it's been a while since I have been heard from you
,I should just tell you to leave cause I
,Know exactly where it leads but I
,Watch us go round and round each time
,You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
,And I got that good girl thing and a tight little skirt,
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style.
,So it goes
,He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
,Takes me home
,Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
,I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
,Some other girl
,He says, what you've heard it's true but I
,Can't stop thinking about you and I
,I said I've been there too a few times
,Cause You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
,Cause we never go out of style

,And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
,And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
,Cause we never go out of style
,We never go out of style
,Looking at it now
,It all seems so simple
,We were lying on your couch
,I remember
,You took a Polaroid of us
,Then discovered
,The rest of the world was black and white
,But we were in screaming color
,And I remember thinking…
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods yet?

,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods?
,Looking at it now
,Last December,
,we were built to fall apart
,Then fall back together
,Your necklace hanging from my neck
,The night we couldn’t quite forget
,When we decided
,To move the furniture so we could dance
,Baby, like we stood a chance
,Two paper airplanes flying, flying…
,And I remember thinking
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods?
,Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
,Twenty stitches in a hospital room
,When you started crying
,Baby, I did too
,But when the sun came up
,I was looking at you
,Remember when we couldn’t take the heat
,I walked out, I said “I’m setting you free”
,But the monsters turned out to be just trees
,When the sun came up
,You were looking at me.
,You were looking at me… Oh
,You were looking at me.
,I remember.
,Oh, I remember..
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods yet?
,Are we out of the woods?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,Are we in the clear yet?
,In the clear yet, good.

,'Cause you still don't know what I never said
,I wish you would come back

,It's two A. M. in my room
,Headlights pass the window pane
,I think of you
,We were a crooked love
,In a straight line down
,Makes you wanna run and hide
,But it makes you turn back around
,I wish you would come back
,Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
,And I wish you knew that
,I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
,Wish you were right here, right now
,It's all good
,I wish you would

,Stay back where you stood
,I wish you would I wish you would
,I wish you would, I wish you would
,I wish you would, I wish you would
,It's two A. M., here we are
,I see your face

,We were a crooked love
,In a straight line down
,Makes you wanna run and hide
,But it made us turn right back around
,I wish you would come back
,Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
,And I wish you knew that

,This is another way I've written songs recently.
,This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes "I made this amazing track the other day.
,It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."
,And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said "Please, please let me have that.
,Let me play with is, send it to me".
,And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called "I Wish You Would", because Jack wrote back and said "I love that".
,So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:
,Okay so this is an idea called "I Wish You Would".
,It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic.
,This track is sick, hope you like this
,It's 2 am, in your car
,Windows down, past my street the memories start
,It's in the past
,You drive straight ahead
,You thinking that I hate you now Cause you stll don't know what I never said
,I wish you would come back Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
,I wish you knew that I never forget you
,you were right here right now，it's all good
,I wish you would
,Do you like it!?

,Did you have to ruin, what was shining now its all rusted
,Did you have to hit me, were I'm weak baby I couldn’t breathe

,Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams

,And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
,But this is getting good now
,He's so tall, and handsome as hell
,He's so bad but he does it so well
,And when we've had our very last kiss, my last request is…

,Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sun set, babe
,Red lips and rosy cheeks
,Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams
,Wildest dreams
,You see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
,Burn it down
,Some day when you  leave me
,I bet these memories hunt you around
,You see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
,Burn it down
,Some day when you leave me
,I bet these memories follow you around

,Red lips and rosy cheeks
,Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
,Say you'll remember me

,昨日之事不可追,
,曾经的美好随风而去.
,淡淡的心里痛痛的,
,曾经牵手的画面历历在目.
,你随风远去,身在何方,
,我的心随你而去......
,
,爱遥不可及,
,世间万物过眼云烟.
,世间男女,何去何从........
,
,是否真的有永远的爱情.
,还是爱情本来就不能永远,
,只是追求一种淡淡的爱,
,让我们在心中.
,分离是痛苦的但是却又是必须的,,,,,,
,因为我们必须做出一些选择,
,但愿一切多好.......
,享受这首歌把,
,享受你们的爱把.....
,我们永远记得我们的爱

,War to peace
,And everyone to everyone's neighbor
,And misery and suffering
,Will be words to be forgotten
,Forever

,Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine

,Joni was a girl who lived next door.
,I've known her I guess ten years or more.
,Joni wrote me a note one day,
,And this is what she had to say:
,"Jimmy please say you'll wait for me.
,I'll grow up some day you'll see.
,Saving all my kisses just for you.
,Signed with love forever true."
,Slowly I read her note once more.
,Then I went over to the house next door.
,Her teardrops fell like rain that day,
,when I told Joni what I had to say:
,"Joni, Joni please don't cry.
,You'll forget me by and by.
,You're just fifteen, I'm twenty-two,
,and Joni I just can't wait for you."
,Soon I left our little home town.
,Got me a job and tried to settle down,
,but these words kept haunting my memory,
,the words that Joni said to me:
,"Jimmy please say you'll wait for me.
,I'll grow up some day you'll see.
,Saving all my kisses just for you.
,Signed with love forever true."
,I packed my clothes and I caught a plane.
,I had to see Joni, I had to explain,
,How my heart was filled with her memory,
,and ask my Joni if she'd marry me.
,I ran all the way to the house next door,
,but things weren't like they were before.
,My teardrops fell like rain that day,
,when I hear what Joni had to say:
,"Jimmy, Jimmy please don't cry.
,You'll forget me by and by.
,It's been five years since you've been gone.
,and Jimmy I marry your best friend john

,Now it looks as though
,they're here to stay
,Oh, I believe in yesterday.

,Suddenly,
,I'm not half the man I used to be
,There's a shadow hanging over me
,Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

,And you its only seed
,It's the heart afraid of breaking
,That never learns to dance
,It's the dream afraid of waking

,It's the one who won't be taken

When  A  Child  Is  Born  -  The  Bachelors
  A  ray  of  hope  flickers  in  the  sky
    A  tiny  star  lights  up  way  up  high,
    All  across  the  land  dawns  a  brand  new  moring
    This  comes  to  pass  when  a  child  is  born
    The  silent  wish  sails  the  seven  seas
    The  winds  of  change  whisper  in  the  trees
    And  the  words  of  doubt  crumble,  toss  and  torn
    This  comes  to  pass  when  a  child  is  born.
    A  rosy  hue  settles  all  around
    You´ve  got  the  feeling.  You´re  on  solid  ground.
    For  a  spell  of  two  no  one  seems  forlorn,
    This  comes  to  pass  when  a  child  is  born.
    And  all  of  this  happens  because
  the  world  is  waiting,  waiting  for  one  child.
    Black,  white,  yellow
    No  one  knows.  But  a  child  that  will  grow  up
  and  turn  tears  into  laughter.
    Hate  to  love,  war  to  peace
    And  everyone  to  everyone´s  neighbor
    And  misery  and  suffering  will  be  words
  to  be  forgotten,  forever.
    It´s  all  a  dream,  an  illusion  now.
    It  must  come  true  sometimes  soon  somehow.
    All  across  the  land  dawns  the  brand  new  moring.
    This  comes  to  pass  when  a  child  is  born.
    when  a  child  is  born.
    when  a  child  is  born.

,Here in Harlan County, the choices are few
,To keep food on the table and the babies in shoes
,You can grow marijuana way back in the pines
,Or work for the man down in the mine
,.
,You never forget your first day in the hole
,There's a pit in your stomach and your mouth's full of coal
,There's no turning back once you make up your mind
,As the cart rattles on down in the mine
,.
,Way down in the mine, your tears turn to mud
,And you can't catch your breath for the dust in your lungs
,Loading hillbilly gold where the sun never shines
,Twelve hours a day, diggin' your grave
,Way down in the mine
,.
,Well the old timers talk but you just don't believe
,It can all go to hell at two thousand feet
,Life sways in the balance of nature and time
,And fate has no mercy down in the mine
,.
,The news spreads like fire and burned through those hills
,Hopes were held high but five men got killed
,On the wings of canaries, your soul surely flies
,While your bones spend eternity down in the mine
,.
,Way down in the mine, your tears turn to mud
,And you can't catch your breath for the dust in your lungs
,Loading hillbilly gold where the sun never shines
,Twelve hours a day, diggin' your grave

She's been playing in a room on a strip
For ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror
But she only ages
She's been reading about Nashville
And all the records that everybody's buying
Says I'm a simple girl myself
Grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
She's gone country, look at them boots
She's gone country, back to her roots
She's gone country, a new kind of suit
She's gone country, here she comes
Well the folk scene is dead
But he's holding out in the village
He's been writing songs speaking out
Against wealth and privilege
He says, \"I don't believe in money
But a man could make him a killin'
'Cause some of that stuff don't sound
Much different than Dylan\"
I hear down there it's changed you see
They're not as backwards as they used to be
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, back to his roots
He's gone country, a new kind of suit
He's gone country, here he comes
He commutes to LA
But he's got a house in the valley
But the bills are piling up
And the pop scene just ain't on the rally
He says, \"Honey I'm a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This ain't no place for children\"
Lord it sounds so easy it shouldn't take long
Be back in the money in no time at all
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, back to his roots
He's gone country, a new kind of suit
He's gone country, here he comes
Yeah, he's gone country, a new kind of walk
He's gone country, a new kind of talk
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, oh, back to his roots
He's gone country
He's gone country
Everybody's gone country
Yeah, we've gone country
The whole world's gone country

,自己躺在
,花园的门外
,不容选择
,我的此刻
,注定和繁华放开
,身边空间如此狭窄
,我双翼展不开
,对着小小的天窗呼喊
,能有几颗星星明白
,我收拾好悲伤
,背起沉重行囊
,开始向未知远航
,我重来不伪装
,不想和他们一样
,安于现状只会将希望埋葬
,总有一片更大的天空
,等我去飞翔
,天地之间再多尘埃
,染不了我一身羽白
,锋利荆棘在脚下踩
,疼痛却教会我忍耐
,金子或石头我的未来
,不必猜我自己主宰
,这渴望是如此的澎湃
,就算最终面对失败
,也无法更改
,我心中的故乡
,不能守在你的身旁
,梦起飞的地方
,永不会被遗忘
,记住那欢笑泪水就勇敢去闯
,总有一片更大的天空
,等我去飞翔
,我收拾好悲伤
,背起沉重行囊

,我们都曾经寂寞而给对方承诺
,我们都因为折磨而厌倦了生活
,只是这样的日子
,同样的方式
,还要多久
,我们改变了态度而接纳了对方
,我们委屈了自己成全谁的梦想
,只是这样的日子
,还剩下多少
,已不重要
,时常想起过去的温存
,它让我在夜里不会冷
,你说一个人的美丽是认真
,两个人能在一起是缘份
,早知道是这样
,像梦一场
,我才不会把爱都放在同一个地方
,我能原谅
,你的荒唐
,荒唐的是我没有办法遗忘
,早知道是这样
,如梦一场
,我又何必把泪都锁在自己的眼眶
,让你去疯
,让你去狂
,让你在没有我的地方坚强
,让我在没有你的地方疗伤

,Ride on down that road ,they said
,A birth took place last night
,A gift made out of gold , they said
,Was brought into the light
,Three wise men from afar
,Had come to see the child
,Guided by a star , they said
,And angels heard on high .
,Behold this child
, Worthy a golden crown
, He's heaven's smile
, Born in a humble town
,His mother , she was pure , they said
,His father is divine
,The angels reassured , they said
,To give her peace of mind
,Behold this child
,Worthy a golden crown
, He's heaven's smile
, Born in a humble town
,Somewhere down the road
,The story did unfold
,Behold this child
,Born in a humble town
,Behold~~ this child~~
,He is worthy ~so worthy~

I've watched her close her eyes
When she kissed me
And i've heard her moan so low
And i've felt her hold me tight
With all her soul inside
In ways a woman only knows
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth
Lookin' back i can't believe
I couldn't see she needed me
But like a fool i let it end
And it should have been so clear
When i wiped away those tears
There's just some things you can't pretend
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth
Maybe i just saved myself
The pain and all the heartache
Of bein' just another face in the crowd
She made it look so real lord
It came to her so easy
It's one thing that i'll never doubt
You won't see one like her
In this whole world
She's given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didn't love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth

,These times are troubled these times are good
,There always gonna be they rise and they fall
,We take’ em all, the way that we should
,Together you and me forsaking them all
,Deep in the night and by the light of day
,It always looks the same true love always does
,Here by your side or a million miles away
,Nothin’ is ever gonna change the way I feel
,The way it is, is the way that it was
,When I said I do, I meant that I will til’ the end of all time
,Be faithful and true, devoted to you
,That’s what I had in mind, when I said I do
,Well this so world keeps changin’ and the world stays the same
,For all who came before, and it goes hand in hand
,Only you and I can undo all that we became
,That makes us so much more, than a woman and a man
,After everything that comes and goes around
,Has only passed us by, here alone in our dreams
,I know there’s a lonely heart in every lost and found
,But forever you and I will be the ones
,Who found out what forever means
,When I said I do, I meant that I will til’ the end of all time

,That’s what I had in mind, that’s what I had in mind
,When I said I do
,If I had it my way, this would be the first time
,That I made love
,And I would be the first man that your hands touched
,But we've both done our share of livin'
,Taking chances we've been given
,I've never been too big on looking back
,I don't care if I'm your first love,
,But I'd love to be your last
,
,If I could do it over I'd have waited for this moment
,So I could give my heart to you unbroken
,But if our mistakes brought us together
,Does it really matter whether
,We were saints or sinners in the past?
,I don't care if I'm your first love,
,But I'd love to be your last
,
,All I know is what I see when I look at you
,And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
,And all I'm feeling is this feeling
,That I've finally got it right
,
,When I wake up tomorrow
,I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
,And thank my lucky stars I found you
,Cause I know your heart has so much more than anyone has
,Touched before, and nothing matters more to me than that
,I don't care if I'm your first love,
,But I'd love to be your last
,

,Or the sparkle in your baby blues

,I'll remember everything
,
,But I always make my wishes
,For the same thing every time
,If I live to be one hundred
,If I ever get it right
,
,My mind it's raised some thoughts
,And the songs it never end
,And I prayed to God last night
,Just before I went to bed
,
,Even though I can't remember
,A single word He said
,If I live to be one hundred
,If I get it through my head
,
,I always think about you
,And I have to close my eyes
,If I live to be one hundred
,Will I ever cross your mind?
,
,When you close your eyes at night
,And your eyes above your life
,Do you notice there an empty space
,Where I wasn't by your side
,
,Because I always dream about you
,Every time I close my eyes
,If I live to be one hundred
,Will I ever cross your mind?

,Following the hearts desires
,Leads down a path into the fire
,And it burns like the gold in the band
,That he wears on his left hand
,
,There's a light that preys on the shadows of time
,Finds one wide awake in the cold, cold sweat
,In the middle of the darkest night
,And the ghost will knock at the door
,Till you can't keep the secret anymore
,
,A thunder clap hid the sound of a shot on the edge of town
,Covered up the perfect crime no trace of deeds left behind
,Just a rattle of the bone in the closet of the soul
,
,There's a light that preys on the shadows of time
,Finds one wide awake in the cold, cold sweat
,In the middle of the darkest night
,And the ghost will knock at the door

,
,Thought you'll change the weather
,Start a little storm, make a little rain
,
,But I'm gonna do one better
,Have the sun until you pray
,
,I'm a tornado
,
,Looking for a soul to take
,
,You're gonna see me coming by the selfish things that you did
,
,I'm gonna leave you guessing have this fun on this gonna hit
,
,I'm a tornado, looking for a man to break
,
,Yes I'm gonna leave this house, spinning all around
,
,Tossing in the air and playin in the ground
,
,Make sure you'll never found
,
,Mhm
,
,Thought you'll take the swing try another girl, try another night
,
,But it's the paint to bring, my force of nature back to life

,
,The winds are getting stronger and the sky is falling through
,
,You ain't got much longer, I'm a tornado and I'm coming after you
When you walked out the door
I failed to recognize
Not having you no more would be a blessing in disguise
The promises you broke, the lies that you spoke
the way you said goodbye
Final destination's been the inspiration 
in the sad songs that I write
Should be down in the dumps down in the mouth sporting a frown but i ain't
Making the rounds all over town,
running you down but i can't
To tell you the truth the least I could do is send you flowers and a note of thanks
Crying all the way to the bank
Well I just can't forget the way you broke my heart
But it helps when i fret on this old flattop guitar
You see a girl's gotta live and it pays to forgive all you put me thru
I oughta be willing, I'm making a killing, all because of losing you

Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shinning far through shadows dimmed
Giving the life for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh, beautiful star, the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains 'till the break of dawn
Into the land of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star, star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh, beautiful star the hope, the grace
For the redeem the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crowd is one
Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star, star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us a lamp to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem

,Every eye has seen the devil pass them by
,Every hand has been lead away from giving what it can
,And it all comes down to thinking we're alone in this life
,But the truth is everybody's been the wrong and the right
,We all go up and we all come down
,We all get lost and we'll all be found in the middle of us
,We'll all be found in the middle of us
,Every heart has felt a love that breaks apart
,Everyone has had to watch the plans they've made come undone
,And the world keeps spinning even when you've had enough
,But if we all just come together, it's an anchor of love
,We all go up and we all come down
,We all get lost and we'll all be found in the middle of us
,We'll all be found in the middle of us

,Eight mouths open crying to be fed
,Sixteen hands a single loaf of bread
,Two cold eyes too sad to shed a tear
,Eighteen years that I've been living here
,Oh my brothers oh my sisters
,You won't see me again
,I've headed out west to join the Williams gang
,Sixteen coaches running down the track
,Eight men ride through the night so black
,Four gunshots go through the railman's head
,One more man lies in a pool of red
,Oh my brothers oh my sisters
,I'm on this dusty plain
,I rob every stagecoach and passenger train
,One bright morning fast asleep in bed
,One soft voice coos up you sleepy head
,Two thick barrels pressed against my face
,Four strong hands drag me from this place
,Tell my brothers tell my sisters
,They won't see me again
,For early next morning by rope I will hang
,See my brothers see my sisters
,See my mother's face
,They've come much too late for by rope I am hanged
I'm gonna wear what I want to cause I want to
I don't need no man
I'm gonna drink what I want to cause I want to
Just because I can
I'm gonna spend my money cause it's mine
Shot of SoCo and lime
Cause it's girls night out
I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, watch where you step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me ride that donkey
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step
Are you gonna sit there and think or buy me a drink, boy?
What's your plan?
All my girls with me, you like what you see
Oh baby this is your last chance
You've been watching since the moment we walked in
So while your boys are busy be talkin'
I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, watch where you step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me ride that donkey
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step
Now slide, slide, two steps
Slide, slide, two steps

Grind, grind, grind, switch
Slide, slide, two steps
Slide, slide, two steps
Work it out, work it out
Grind, grind, grind, switch
I'm gonna rock my cowboy hat and pink stilettos
We're gonna stomp and kick until they make us all go home
You wanna see if a little country girl can get down
Let me show you how
Hey little lady, maybe you and me
Could possibly get together for a shot of Jack D
And take a little spinner by the dance floor
Tell me do you want more
All you gotta do is just say so
I can line dance, baby, I can buck dance
Take you down a dirt road, back of the truck dance
Cause Laura Bell you hell on the heart
Good Lord you're gonna tear this country boy apart
I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, watch where you step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me ride that donkey

,She walks to school with a lunch she packed
,Nobody knows what she's holding back;
,Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday,
,She hides the bruises with the linen and lace;
,oh
,The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask,
,It's hard to see the pain behind the mask;
,Bearing the burdon of a secret storm,
,Sometimes she wishes she was never born;
,Through the wind and the rain,
,She stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above;
,But her dreams give her wings
,and she flies to a place where she's loved.
,Concrete Angel
,Somebody cries in the middle of the night,
,The neighbors hear but they turn out the lights;
,A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate,
,When morning comes it will be too late.
,Through the wind and the rain,
,She stands hard as a stone in a world that she can't rise above;
,But her dreams give her wings
,and she flies to a place where she's loved.
,Concrete Angel
,A statue stands in a shaded place,
,An angel girl with an upturned face;
,Her name is written on a polished rock,
,A broken heart that the world forgot.

,Well I woke up this morning stumbled out of my rack
,I opened up the paper to the page in the back
,It only took a minute for my finger to find
,My daily dose of destiny, under my sign
,My eyes just about popped out of my head
,It said "the stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed"
,I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
,No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way
,Mmmmm, I feel lucky today
,Well I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
,The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
,I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
,Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
,The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
,I heard a voice above me saying, "girl, you better get back home"
,But I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
,No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
,Mmmmm, I feel lucky today
,
,Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
,I'd bought the house a double, and the waitress a new car
,Dwight Yoakam's in the corner, trying to catch my eye
,Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
,The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
,Hey the stars might lie, but the numbers never do
,I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
,Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
,Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight
,I feel lucky, brrrrr, I feel lucky, yeah
,Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
,Mmmmmm, I feel lucky today

You're the hardest working man in this town 
Sun up to sun down 
You're always formulating some sort of plan 
Cuz you need something to do with your hands 
I've seen them break the black dirt in the yard 
I've heard them working 'neath the hood of your car 
They fix the leaky pipe under the sink 
Easy to see they can do anything , 
Boy you better not be too tired when you get home tonight 
Please understand 
I've got this burning deep down in my soul that's got me longing to hold 
Onto my man 
And if you need something to do with your hands

,I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
,Some other girl

,Flashing lights and we
,Took a wrong turn and we
,Fell down a rabbit hole.
,You held on tight to me
,'Cause nothing's as it seems
,I'm spinning out of control.
,Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
,Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
,Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
,Ooooo
,Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
,I felt your arms twisting 'round me
,I should have slept with one eye open at night.
,We found wonderland
,You and I got lost in it
,And we pretended it could last forever
,aye
,We found wonderland
,You and I got lost in it
,And life was never worse but never better
,aye aye

,In wonderland

,So we went on our way
,To and left a thing straight
,All alone or so it seemed.
,But there were strangers watching
,And whispers turned to talking
,And talking turned to screams.
,Oooooh
,Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
,Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
,Didn't you calm my fears with the Cheshire cat smile?
,Ooooo
,Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
,I felt your arms twisting 'round me
,It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
,But darling, we found wonderland
,You and I got lost in it
,And we pretended it could last forever

,And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.

,The drought was the very worst
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,It was months, and months of back and forth
,You're still all over me like I wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
,On my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turn black like a perfect storm
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,There was nothing left to do
,And the butterflies turned to dust they covered my whole room
,So I punched a hole in the roof
,Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
,The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,I think I am finally clean
,Said, I think I am finally clean
,10 months sober, I must admit
,Just because you're clean don't mean you don‘t miss it
,10 months older I won't give in
,Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
,The drive was the fairy worst
,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
,That's when I could finally breathe
,And that morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
,If I am lost for a day, try and find me
,But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me
,All of the things that I thought were so easy
,Just got harder and harder each day
,December is the darkest and June is the light
,But this empty bedroom won't make anything right
,While out on the landing, a friend I forgot to send home
,Who waits up for me all through the night
,Calendar girl who's in love with the world,
,Stay alive
,Calendar girl who's in love with the world,
,Stay alive
,I dreamed I was dying, as I so often do
,And when I awoke I was sure it was true
,I ran to the window, threw my head to the sky
,And said "whoever is up there, please don't let me die"
,But I can't live forever, I can't always breathe
,One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea
,The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross
,And I'll laugh about all that we've lost
,Calendar girl who is lost to the world,
,Stay alive
,Calendar girl who is lost to the world,
,Stay alive
,January, February, March, April, May
,I'm alive
,June, July, August, September, October,
,I'm alive
,November, December, yeah all through the winter,
,I'm alive
,I'm alive

,Looks up, my fire
,Look right at me, we're running
,Bursting through, last train home
,I'm left with you, with our compass just passing through
,Colours, inspire
,Sapphire, dances in me
,Long road
,Your beckoning, I'm following
,Home brings, a tangled mess
,Behind the lens, night ends
,Catch me, in a light glow
,Completely, I give up oh so willingly
,Fragments, taken
,Looking glass, see right through me
,Sleepless, walls down

,Hey little lady
,You’ve cried too much lately
,Don’t you think you’ve had enough
,The past and the present
,Doesn’t seem God sent
,You’re waiting but the times get tough
,Open up your eyes and say all your goodbyes
,As you walk outside the door to leave
,No, you never looked back
,Never took a real chance
,You just locked the door and took the key
,You can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun
,Hop in your car
,Turn the radio on
,Singing songs like we were singing along
,When the morning comes
,You’ll be so far gone
,Wish I would’ve got the chance to say
,That if you never come back
,I just want you to know
,I’m gonna love you either way
,Hey pretty momma
,Don’t you start cryin’
,Don’t let yourself go frail and weak
,There’s hope in tomorrow
,Happiness to borrow
,Till’ you you get to where you need
,I know your baby’s left
,But it’s really for the best
,It’s not the future that you wanted to see
,But maybe some day soon
,She’ll be back in this room
,And finally be the woman she outta be
,She can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun
,Hop in your car
,Turn the radio on
,Singing songs like we were singing along
,When the morning comes
,You’ll be so far gone
,Wish I would’ve got the chance to say
,That if you never come back
,I just want you to know
,I’m gonna love you either way
,
,Morning do dripping down the window pale
,Disappering in the light of day
,It's not home when you gone
,Morning do dripping down the window pale
,Disappering in the light of day
,Let's wondering where you gone
,You can run away
,Take everything you own
,And be gone before the rising sun
,Hop in your car
,Turn the radio on
,Singing songs like we were singing along
,When the morning comes
,You’ll be so far gone
,Wish I would’ve got the chance to say

,By an old drinking well on the grass so green
,I lay down and fell into a dream
,By a strange mellow sound from a silver eyed bird
,I opened my eyes but said no word
,On the pathway came walking a woman so bold
,Behind her in silence went the old
,
,Ahead ran the children with joyful cries
,Their faces were lifted to the skies
,The woman's hair was raven and black as the night
,Covered with stars shining bright
,As they passed by the well I saw that their eyes
,Were flaming like many coloured ice
,They passed by the well like a breeze pure and clean
,Soon they were nowhere to be seen
,
,When I woke up alone on the grass so green
,I looked into the well to catch the dream
,The water was rising and I felt a chill
,I willed the water to be still
,There was a face in the mirror like a face out of time
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,There was a face in the mirror
,and the face wasn't mine
,The eyes held a shimmery shine
,
,It's easy to see how everything is loosely
,Put into a box to describe how
,Well it is working
,But can you tell me
,How did she knock me off of my feet
,When she said hello
,My name is beautiful
,I said excuse me miss but it's time for me to hit the floor
,And now this dancing has turned to falling
,Words can't do justice to this girl I know
,
,And It's those deep breaths that get me through the times
,She's standing next to me
,She's nothing short of lovely
,Does she notice that I can't breathe
,Everything around me is getting hazy
,I'll loosen up my tie
,No use in being shy
,So take one petal at a time
,And toss it to the ground
,Closer now, I'll touch your lips to mine
,And feel how we have to hold our breath
,To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight
,
,Under this moonlight
,I can see the mystery behind your eyes
,With every taste girl, well I delight in you
,And yet this distance
,That separates my hand from yours
,Can only make me appreciate your heart
,I adore you
,
,So take one petal at a time
,And toss it to the ground
,Closer now, I'll touch your lips to mine
,And feel how we have to hold our breath
,To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight
,Quiet now, she's fast asleep
,And to my arm she's clinging
,You're mine girl
,And my heart is yours
,
,So take one petal at a time
,And toss it to the ground
,Closer now, I'll touch your lips to mine
,And feel how we have to hold our breath
,To make sure we don't miss one moment tonight
,In my dreams
,I feel your light
,I feel love is born again
,Fireflies
,In the moonlight
,Rising stars
,Remember
,The day
,I fell in love with you
,Darling won't you break
,My heart
,Take my hand now
,Stay close to me
,be my lover
,Won't you let me go
,close your eyes now
,And you will see
,There's a rainbow
,For you and me
,As I wake up
,I see your face
,I feel love is born again
,Cherry blossom
,Flying birds
,In the sky
,Can't you see
,The sun
,That is shining on the fields
,Is it shining in
,Your heart
,Take my hand now
,Stay close to me
,be my lover
,Won't you let me go
,Close your eyes now
,And you will see
,There's a rainbow
,For you and me
,And I dream of you
,Every night
,Cause's there only you
,In my mind
,Will you be
,A stranger or a friend in my life
,Darling won't you break
,My heart
,Take my hand now

,I can hardly remember
,Oh the tales that I could tell you
,If I only could remember
,And the fog it is drumming
,And the new world is coming
,Oh this song I will be humming
,When the words wont come out
,On a slow boat to China
,I will be, I will be
,In the sea, when we get there
,We will see what will be
,On a slow boat to China

,I’ve been aiming for the top
,Just like a rocket taking off
,You got me high I’m flying in a dream
,Got me feeling like the one
,And after everything you’ve done
,Just let me take this little moment to say
,
,That you’re so special to me
,All that I want and need
,You’re so special to me
,And I want the world to see
,So special, special
,
,See I always feel the rush
,And I don’t tell you this enough
,But you’re the one who makes me happy
,You’re my future don’t deny it
,From time to time I bid to ride it
,But I guess what I am trying to say
,Is you’re so special to me
,All that I want and need

,Woke up this morning thought,
,Gotta change my life
,I'm like a ship in the sand
,Just waiting for to die I got lot of reasons
,glad to be alive but always waking up alone
,just makes me wanna die.
,But always waking up alone,
,just makes me wanna die.
,I may be lonely but I'm not stupid
,I try to live with my mistake
,So I stay awake to ease all pain
,But I've never been very good at playing that game
,No I've never been very good at anything
,Forget the past it's just an ugly background
,That stains everything we try to believe in
,And except the things that failed love brings
,And don't project it onto anyone else
,and don't project it onto anyone else
,Always in a rush
,Never stay on the phone long enough
,Why am I so self-important?
,Said I'd see you soon
,But that was, oh, maybe a year ago
,Didn't know time was of the essence
,So many questions
,But I'm talking to myself
,I know that you can't hear me any more
,Not anymore
,So much to tell you, And most of all goodbye
,But I know that you can't hear me any more
,It's so loud inside my head
,With words that I should've said
,And as I drown in my regrets
,I can't take back the words I never said
,I never said
,I can't take back the words I never said
,Always talking shit
,Took your advice and did the opposite
,Just being young and stupid
,I haven't been all that you could've hoped for
,But if you'd held on a little longer
,You'd have had more reasons to be proud
,So many questions
,But I'm talking to myself
,I know that you can't hear me any more
,Not anymore
,So much to tell you
,And most of all goodbye
,But I know that you can't hear me any more
,It's so loud inside my head
,with words that I should've said
,As I drown in my regrets
,I can't take back the words
,The longer I stand here
,The louder the silence
,I know that you're gone but sometimes I swear that I hear
,Your voice when the wind blows
,So I talk to the shadows
,Hoping you might be listening 'cos I want you to know
,It's so loud inside my head
,with words that I should've said
,As I drown in my regrets
,I can't take back the words I never said
,I never said
,I can't take back the words I never said
,Never said
,I can't take back the words I never said
,God rest ye merry, gentlemen
,Let nothing you dismay
,Remember, Christ, our Saviour
,Was born on Christmas day
,To save us all from Satan's power
,When we were gone astray
,O tidings of comfort and joy,
,In Bethlehem, in Israel,
,This blessed Babe was born
,And laid within a manger
,Upon this blessed morn
,Now to the Lord sing praises,
,All you within this place,
,And with true love and brotherhood
,Each other now embrace;
,This holy tide of Christmas
,All other doth deface.
,O tidings of comfort and joy,
,Comfort and joy
,O tidings of comfort and joy
,From God our Heavenly Father
,A blessed Angel came;
,And unto certain Shepherds
,Brought tidings of the same:
,How that in Bethlehem was born
,The Son of God by Name.
,O tidings of comfort and joy,
,Comfort and joy
,O tidings of comfort and joy

,I was a little girl alone in my little world
,who dreamed of a little home for me.
,I played pretend between the trees,
,and fed my houseguests bark and leaves,
,and laughed in my pretty bed of green.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest swing.
,I had a dream.
,
,Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park,
,I asked God who I'm supposed to be.
,The stars smiled down on me,
,God answered in silent reverie.
,I said a prayer and fell asleep.
,I had a dream
,That I could fly from the highest tree.
,I had a dream.
,
,oh~
,Now I'm old and feeling grey.
,I don't know what's left to say about this life
,I'm willing to leave.
,I lived it full and I lived it well,
,there's many tales I've lived to tell.
,I'm ready now, I'm ready now,
,I'm ready now to fly from the highest wing.
,I had a dream.
,
,I found I missed all we were
,I found I miss all of her
,We find strength in being alone
,and kept my mind consumed in my work
,That way I can keep moving on
,and not dwell on whats been and gone
,I guess I just suppressed all my thoughts
,and told myself I had to move on
,But sometimes, I break down
,I'll lose track thinking of you now
,But somewhere and somehow
,I'll move on
,Can you see. Can you see me now
,Can you see me now, yeah
,Can you see me now
,Can you see me now, yeah
,When we met again I changed
,I didn't want to cause you more pain
,You brought back how I first felt
,made me want to start us again
,But you were holding something back
,I could tell by that you'd act
,You wanna tell me but you didn't really dare
,cause you couldn't really bare to see me react
,And sometimes, I break down
,I'll lose track thinking of you now
,And somewhere and somehow
,I'll move on
,Can you see. Can you see me now
,Can you see me now, yeah
,Can you see me now
,Can you see me now, yeah
,You unchained my heart then tore it in two
,Cried my eyes dry over memories of you
,Wish I could lie and just say that we're through
,I hate myself more for still loving you
,Knew who you were but I don't know you now
,Divided in two and I'm shadowed with doubt
,You told me the truth, you just ripped my heart out
,So I'll leave here alone
,See me now, Oh
,Can you see me now, can you see me now. Oh Oh
,Can you see me now

,Who knows?
,I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
,That now our dreams

,It's love

,A glance
,A touch
,A dance
,
,To look in somebody's eyes
,To light up the skies
,To open the world and send them reeling
,A voice that says, I'll be here
,And you'll be alright
,I don't care if I know
,Just where I will go
,'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
,A rat-tat-tat on my heart…

,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night

,
,I don't need your honesty
,It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes they speak for me
,No one knows me like you do
,And since you're the only one that mattered, tell me who do I run to
,
,Look don't get me wrong
,I know there is no tomorrow
,All I ask
,
,Is if this is my last night with you
,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
,Give me a memory I can use
,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
,It matters how this ends
,Cause what if I never love again
,
,Let this be our lesson in love
,Let this be the way we remember us
,I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
,And I ain't asking for forgiveness
,All I ask
,
,Is if this is my last night with you
,Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
,Give me a memory I can use
,Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
,It matters how this ends
,Cause what if I never love again

,If our love was a fairy tale
,I would charge in and rescue you
,On a yacht baby we would sail
,To an island where we’d say I do
,And if we had babies they would look like you
,It’d be so beautiful if that came true
,You don’t even know how very special you are
,Chorus
,You leave me breathless
,You’re everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can’t believe that you’re mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you’re leaving me
,Breathless
,And if our love was a story book
,We would meet on the very first page
,The last chapter would be about
,How I’m thankful for the life we’ve made
,And if we had babies they would have your eyes
,I would fall deeper watching you give life
,You don’t even know how very special you are
,You leave me breathless
,You’re everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can’t believe that you’re mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you’re leaving me
,You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me
,You’re like an angel
,The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me
,You’re something special
,I only hope that I’ll one day deserve what you’ve given me
,But all I can do is try
,Every day of my life
,You leave me breathless
,You’re everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can’t believe that you’re mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you’re leaving me
,Breathless
,You leave me breathless
,You’re everything good in my life
,You leave me breathless
,I still can’t believe that you’re mine
,You just walked out of one of my dreams
,So beautiful you’re leaving me
,Breathless

,Then I won't call you
,And I won't be in your life
,I don't love you
,When you were young you used to dream about fires
,And scream into the night

,I used to whisper it will be alright
,And lay down at your side

, Малышка, перестань, я сам устал
, Давай, перелистав, все расставим по местам.
, Мне надоели эти ссоры, снова и снова
, Как-будто ищем повод, но повода нет такого.
, Я захлопну дверь, типа: "На, реви!"
, А сам мысленно прошу: "Обратно позови!"
, Постою за дверью пару минут и уйду
, А так хотел сказать: "Люблю!".
, Разве ты не знаешь, как люблю тебя я?
, Ты пойми любовь живет, грехи прощая
, Если хочешь, то уйду я, так и будет
, Мое сердце твои губы не забудет.
,
, Я без тебя не смог, пытался, видит Бог
, Вдыхал тебя как смок, ты мой последний вдох,
, Я без тебя не смог, это чистая правда
, Тогда зачем все это надо, моя отрада?!
, Когда ты плачешь и слезы твои капают
,
, В груди колотит, больно сердцу моему
, И, вроде, давно пора завязывать с этим
, Но ведем себя как дети, типа не в ответе.
, Я без тебя не смог, теперь я одинок
, И, вдруг, все стало ясно, важно пару строк
, Забудем все обиды, ссоры и все слова
, Я люблю тебя и ты мне очень нужна.
,
, Разве ты не знаешь, как люблю тебя я?
, Ты пойми любовь живет, грехи прощая
, Если хочешь, то уйду я, так и будет
, Мое сердце твои губы не забудет.
, Разве ты не видишь какого нам?!
, Без тебя нет сна и нет покоя
, Мы с тобой, друг друга убивая
, Просим у любви кусочек рая.
,
, Время залечит раны, унесет боль
, И, как всегда упрямо, буду рядом с тобой.
, Ты прости, знаю, тебе было трудно
, На моей груди усни, я встречу утром.
, Мне не надо никого, среди тысяч и сотен
, С тобою мне легко, я впервые свободен
, Обнимая, только об одном тебя прошу:
, "Никуда не уходи!", и я не отпущу.
,
, Разве ты не знаешь, как люблю тебя я?
, Ты пойми любовь живет, грехи прощая
, Если хочешь, то уйду я, так и будет
, Мое сердце твои губы не забудет.

,Miley, I can understand why
,you'd wanna be somebody else for awhile
,you've been so many people for so many years
,All things ruin, crack and mold
,new things grow then we call them old
,But we're all looking for a lie that we can share
,Did you feel the limelight
,Slipping away from your hold
,Did you feel the darkness sinking into your soul
,Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
,To feel forgotten, to be forgot
,Amy died running through the night
,Trying to hide from the quiet inside
,But you never can, you never will, it's yours
,Takes it's toll all that rock n roll
,It takes another little piece of your heart and soul
,We are looking for the climb not the fall
,Did you feel the limelight
,Slipping away from your hold
,Did you feel the darkness sinking into your soul
,Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
,To feel forgotten, to be forgot
,Can you see the names
,in the flickering lights they're gonna fade
,Cos' we are all the same
,With the voices in our heads lingering
,We just want to be
,Someone somebody else wants to be
,Did you believe Hollywood was gonna set you free
,Did you feel the limelight
,Slipping away from your hold
,Did you feel the darkness sinking down into your soul
,Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
,To feel forgotten, to be forgot

,I've given you chances, you're a lucky guy
,Love is pure, as cure as seen
,Neither of us are perfect, but you're just being mean
,So cross my heart, and made to die
,Stick a needle, in my eye
,If only once, if only twice
,But one more time, and you've crossed the

,I'm not looking for somebody
,With some superhuman gifts
,Some superhero
,Some fairytale bliss
,Just something I can turn to
,Somebody I can kiss
,I want something just like this
,My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
,the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
,And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
,it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

,
,Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
,I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
,I sent two letters back in autumn You must not have got 'em
,There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
,
,Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
,But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
,My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm out to be a father
,If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'm-a
,name her Bonnie.
,
,I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
,I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't wanthim.
,I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggestfan.
,I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam.
,
,I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.
,I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat.
,Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
,Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.
,
,My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

,And even if I could it'd all be great, to put your picture on my wall
,it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
,
,Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
,I hope you have the chance.
,I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans.
,If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert
,You didn't have to but you could have signed an autograph for Matthew.
,That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old.
,We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours and ya just said no.
,That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
,He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more
,than I do.
,
,I ain't that mad, but I just don't like bein' lied to.
,Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you
,You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way.
,I never knew my father neither.
,He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
,
,I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.
,So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on.
,Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit help when I'm depressed.
,I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.
,
,Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.
,It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me.
,See, everything you say is real, and I respect you
,'cause you tell it.
,My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7.
,But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does.
,She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up.
,You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan
,you'll ever lose.
,Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.
,
,My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
,the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
,And even if I could it'd all be great, to put your picture on my wall
,it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
,
,Dear Mr. "I'm too good to call or write my fans"
,This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.
,It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
,I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.
,
,So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it.
,I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway.
,Hey Slim, "I drank a fifth of vodka, ya dare me to drive?"
,You know that song by Phil Collins from "The Air In The Night"?
,About that guy who could have saved that other guy fromdrowning?
,But didn't? Then Phil saw it all then at his show he found him?
,That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me fromdrowning.
,Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy.
,
,And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.
,I hope you know I ripped all o' your pictures off the wall.
,I love you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it.
,You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
,And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.
,I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.
,See Slim, {screaming} shut up bitch, I'm trying to talk
,Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
,But I didn't slit her throat,
,I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.
,'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,
,and then she'll die too.
,Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now.
,Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
,
,{screeching tires, crashing sounds, car splashes into thewater}
,
,My tears gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
,the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
,And even if I could it'd all be great, but your picture on my wall
,it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
,
,Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy.
,You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
,Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that.
,And here's an autograph for your brother:
,I wrote it on your Starter cap.
,
,I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you.
,Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you.
,And what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
,I say that shit just clownin' dawg,
,c'mon, how fucked up is you?
,You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
,To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some.
,
,And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
,That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other.
,I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.
,Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
,I hope you get to read this letter.
,I just hope it reaches you in time.
,Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin' just fine
,If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
,Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan.
,I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.
,I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.
,Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
,And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was
,pregnant with his kid
,And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who it was to
,Come to think about it...his name was...it was you.
,Damn.

,Tom's at the piano talkin' to a ghost
,Playin' with his eyes shut tight
,Here's a little song I learnt it from the wind
,I heard it on the wind last night
,Beats workin' in the field for a little blind boy
,Playin' in the dime museum
,Day the colonel came and he take ya by the hand
,What a lucky day for him
,When Tom is at the bench his hands are not his own
,Some spirit in the room takes hold
,Never seen the sun much less read a note
,But he makes ya wanna tap your toes
,Make your daddy proud oh make your daddy rich
,Some candy and cake for Tom
,Till the crowd dies down and the colonel's in the grave
,And the candy and the cake are gone
,Tom's at the piano talkin' to a ghost
,Playin' with his eyes shut tight
,Here's a little song I learnt it from the wind
,I heard it on the wind last night

,As I remember how we were
,Your touch would make me just run back to you
,But how could this be when your heart's no more free?
,The place got empty without you being around
,I don't need this parfumed candles on the ground
,The sound of the silence running through my mind
,Is tearing me down, I'm so empty inside
,Hey, turn around and tell me
,How could you surrender our love?

,По воде танцуем.
,A couple years before I lost control
,and ended up inside.
,Кто нас узнал? Угадай.
,Мы его рисуем.

,I stopped taking all my pills
,they made me feel so dead inside
,Время бежит и никто
,У него не спросит.
,Just like the sun was going out
,I didn't think I сould survive
,Знает об этом лишь он.
,Он тебя попросит
,Спеть ему несколько слов
,Старого мотива.
,И те слова улетят

,they always bought me so
,I don't wanna get there sang that mysterious
,they're always lying way from me in Memphis till the sea
,
,I never walk down Biostreet
,well maybe used to go
,I sing the Mississippi
,from the river boat
,I don't wanna get back sang that mysterious
,they always lying way from me in Memphis till the sea
,
,I never kiss that brown eyes girl
,that i used to know

,they always left me alone
,and I don't know just where she's go
,If she thinks me
,but I always picture her living in Memphis

,oh Memphis
,we down in Memphis
,we down in Memphis
,till the sea
,
,Here comes the flood again
,Watch it fall from the sky
,Feel it soak through my flesh and my blood
,Feel it burn in my eyes
,When I say how much more can I take?
,I know the water’s rising up, watch the waves crest and break
,And though I’ve made not but a sound
,I fear that I may drown
,I fear that I may drown
,.
,Here comes the wind again
,Cold that cuts to the bone
,Pack my bags and I’ll head out the door
,Here I am on my own
,When I say how much more can I stand?
,I know my walls are falling down; I left the rocks and chose the sand
,And though I’ve no one left to blame
,Still, I cursed your name
,I cursed your name
,.
,So now the end
,What I’ve been running from
,Though I’ve tried I cannot lift my head
,Oh, what have I become?
,When I say how much more can I take?
,I know my time is running short, I am broken and I’ll break
,And though I’ve worn myself so thin
,I’m coming home again
,And though I do not know my heart
,Well, I know myself down to my bones, but if my bones should come apart
,Then I’ll have nothing left to give
,But if you take me in,
,I’m coming home again
,If you take me in
,I’m coming home again
,
,The heels of my shoes are too slippery for grass
,My day dreaming is always set in the past
,Pockets full of pebbles and knees stained in green
,Daisy chains on my head, I'm the garden queen
,The trees in the garden take pity on me
,"Go back to the wonders of city routine
,While I stay happily planted
,My night is filled with stars!"
,Oh
,The height of my heels is ridiculously tall
,I kept hold of your hand, still I tumble and fall

,
,Smoking a cigarette
,Drinking a glass of beer
,Catching a conversation
,I am trying not to hear
,
,One more? Why not? Ok.
,Guess I'm glad I came
,To stare at English Bay
,Under all the rain
,
,There's a cat in this bar right now
,Twitching his tail away
,I called with a soft meow
,Maybe he only speaks Francais
,
,You must be safe in bed
,Down in your cowboy home
,I don't wonder why you left
,I wonder why you stayed so long
,
,One more? Why not? Ok.
,I'm glad I came
,And here's to English Bay
,In the lovely rain
,
,I found some matches from Durango in my pocket
,But if I let my heart get sad then I can't stop it
,
,And this is a lonely life
,Though I think it suits me well
,And everything's fine tonight
,Here in the Sylvia Hotel
Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shine away
I'll be coming for your love okay

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone in a day or two

So needless to say at odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's so much better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone in a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just a play
My worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You shine away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone in a day or two
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone (take on me)
In a day or two
Back through the years I go wondering once again 
Back to the seasons of my youth 
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us 
And how my mamma put these rags to use 

There were rags of many colours, and every piece was small 
And I didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall 
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love 
She made my coat of many colours, that I was so proud of 

As she sewed she told the story from the Bible she had read 
About a coat of many colours, joseph wore and they she said 
Perhaps this coat will bring you, much love and happiness 
And I just couldntwait to wear it, and mamma blessed it with a kiss 

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me 
Made only rags, but I wore it so proudly 
Although we had no money. oh I was rich as I could be 
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me 

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes 
In my coat of many colours, I hurried off to school 
Just to find the others laughing and makin?fun of me 
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me 

Oh, I couldntt understand it, for I felt I was rich 
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch 
And I told them all the story, mamma told me while she sewed 
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes 

They didnt under stand it and I tried to make them see 
That one is only poor only if they choose to be 
Now I know we have no money, but It as rich as I could be 
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me 
In my coat of many colours, my mamma just made for me
,Who am I that your eyes, they shine on me

,But deep inside
,In the corner of my mind
,I'm attached to you
,I'm weak
,It's true
,Cause I'm afraid to know the answer
,Do you want me too?
,Cause my heart keeps falling faster
,I've waited all my life
,To cross this line
,To the only thing that's true
,So I will not hide

,Anything to be with you
,All my life I've waited

,You don't know what you do
,Everytime you walk into the room
,I'm afraid to move
,I'm weak
,It's true
,I'm just scared to know the ending
,Do you see me too?
,Do you even know you met me?
,I've waited all my life to cross this line
,To the only thing that's true
,So I will not hide

,I walk alone
,These streets just a little bit crowded
,The faces I know
,No voices a little familiar
,At least I got you on my mind
,It's that little ray of light in these tired eyes
,Where do I walk.. feel a bit lost
,It's getting so hard for me to trust
,Where do I turn it's a road so long
,Everything I use to know is gone
,In the world of lies and alibis
,It's hard to tell a hero from a fool
,But with you, I get nothing but the truth
,No stone's unturned
,You know me  nobody knows me better
,Bridges they burn Just make us a lil bit stronger
,You see for a long long long long long time
,You're still my little ray of hope
,On this day so cold
,Where do I walk feel a bit lost
,It's getting so hard for me to trust
,Where do I turn it's a road so long
,Everything I use to know is gone
,And in a world of lies and alibis
,It's hard to tell a hero from a fool
,But with you, I get nothing but the truth
,You're the only one that keeps me on my feet
,You always let the sun shine down on me
,So give me that little ray of light in these tired eyes
,Where do I walk.. feel a bit lost
,Getting so hard for me to trust
,Where do I turn it's a road so long
,Everything I use to know is gone
,And in a world of lies and alibis
,It's hard to tell a hero from a fool
,But with you, Oh-oh, oh with you
,I get nothing but the truth
,It's getting so hard for me to trust
,Everything I use ... yeah yeah
,And in a world of lies and alibis
,It's hard to tell a hero from a fool
,But with you, I get nothing but the truth
,I lose some sales
,and my boss won't be happy
,but I can't stop listening to the sound
,of two soft voices blended in perfection
,from the reels of this record that I found
,every day there's a boy in the mirror
,asking me
,what are you doing here
,finding all my previous motives
,growing increasingly unclear
,I travelled far and I burned all the bridges ，
,I believed as SOON as I hit land
,all the other
,options held before me
,WILL wither in the light of my plan
,so I lose some sales
,and my boss won't be happy
,but there's only one thing on my mind
,searching boxes underneath the counter
,on a chance that on a tape I'd find
,a song for
,someone who needs somewhere
,to long for
,homesick
,cause I no longer know
,where home is
,where home is
,We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

,Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
,I just heard you found the one you've been looking
,You've been looking for
,I wish I would have known that wasn't me
,Cause even after all this time I still wonder
,Why I can't move on
,Just the way you did so easily
,Don't wanna know
,What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
,If he's holding onto you so tight
,The way I did before

,In the spring we made a boat
,out of feathers, out of bones.
,We set fire to our homes,
,walking barefoot in the snow.
,Distant rhythm of the drum
,as we drifted towards the storm.
,Baby lion lost his teeth,
,now they're swimming in the sea.
,
,Troubled spirits on my chest
,where they laid to rest.
,The birds all left my tall friend
,as your body hit the sand.
,Million stars up in the sky
,formed a tigers eye
,
,that looked down on my face,
,out of time and out of place.
,So hold on,
,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.
,
,Awaken by the sound
,of a screaming owl.
,Chasing leafs in the wind,
,going where we've never been.
,Said goodbye to you my friend,
,as the fire spread.
,All that's left are your bones
,that will soon sink like stones
,So hold on,
,hold on to what we are,
,
,hold on to your heart.

,Не буду,но знаю,что где-то я скучаю.
,Но в мыслях понимаю,все слова твои пустые.
,Но просто отпусти,пойми что больше нет.

,Ведь мы разные,знаешь,я не люблю,ты скучаешь,раздели мы мечты,и ты об этом знаешь.
,Не буду,не надо встречаться даже взглядом.
,Отправил слова вулисон,забудем,что были рядом.
,Пусть уносят ветра о любви все слова твои,забудь и меня прости.

,can't seem to find your strife, just trying to live your life

,
,this sense of indecision ain't what we had in mind

,we're losing all this daylight but soon the moon's gonna rise
,these final puzzle pieces, we tried but they're too tight
,but if we ease the pressure, I bet they'll fit just right
,
,sometimes it takes some patience, sometimes it works first try
,but I know that this is worth it, cause this dream's too strong to die
,I ain't done nothing wrong but we ain't done nothing right

,Planting paper window dreams
,And now I know just what that means
,Most things don't last and love can leave
,And if we hold on to these memories
,Of broken bonds that could not be
,Framed in paper window dreamschuang
,I remember christmas eve
,When I got sick and could not breathe
,Frosted windows and chattered teeth
,A helpless heart stuck on a sleeve
,Framed in paper window dreams
,Everyone I've ever met
,A cause a cure a deep regret
,A face a fear they can't forget
,So now I know just what that means
,Most things don't last and love can leave
,Of broken hands that could not be
,Framed in paper window dreams
,Has felt something I haven't yet

,You blew in like a breeze
,
,and rolled out like a storm

,I took a long, long walk in the forest
,But it didn't stop the buzzing in my brain
,I took a long, long swim in the ocean
,But it didn't wash away the pain
,
,Ah, you left me
,Why did you leave?
,
,I made a long, long drive to the mountains
,But it only made me feel more insane
,I did a fast downhill on my skateboard
,But it never blew away the pain
,
,Ah, you left me
,Why did you leave?
,
,Forgo your hope
,save it from the ashes
,of the will you wrote
,everything passes away ~
,Hold out for what
,you thought you were making
,Just long enough
,to realize you're going the wrong way
,Oh, you hold my heart forever
,But I can't hold on
,to what's not there
,May you blossom like a flower
,May you go dancing in the end
,Give up, give back all that was taken
,Return, relax
,this feeling is not here to stay ~
,Oh, you hold my heart forever
,But I can't hold on
,to what's not there
,May you blossom like a flower
,May you go dancing in the end
,Oh, you hold my heart forever

,This is the starting of my greatest fear*
,I’m all packed up, getting out of here
,But then you call and tell me not to go
,That I’m the one who put the rock 'n roll
,In your life
,This is the starting of a brand new day
,I never liked this town much anyway
,I need this city like I need the rain
,I know that somewhere there’s a north bound train
,Oh I’ll make it without you
,Make it without you
,And though my body's laying here
,It’s my mouth that must be lying now
,This is the starting of my fall from grace
,My self esteem, it’s seen better days
,But you know I’ll never let this go to waste
,I’ll keep this memory on the map I trace
,Back to home
,My friends go out, but I’ve been staying in
,I know I should but that’s the way it’s been
,I never cared much for the taste of gin
,I still don’t now, oh, but it’s been helpin
,Oh I’ll make it without you
,In my life
,Oh I’ll make it without you
,And though my body's laying here
,It’s my mouth that must be lying now
,It’s my mouth that must be lying now
,
,Oh I’ll, oh I’ll make it without you
,Oh I’ll, oh I’ll make it without you
,Oh I’ll, oh I’ll make it without you
,And though my body's laying here
,It’s my mouth that must be lying now
,
,
,Stick, stick to your stones cause that's all you know
,I was caught in the middle
,I swallow my words down to the bone
,Cause nothing's that simple
,Late at night you pour it out
,Know that only brings you down
,But go ahead give me all the blame
,Yeah, twist my words and set them to flame, woah
,We all know
,That you'll go tell all of your friends
,That I'm the one you wish you never met
,And woah
,We all know
,The story never ends
,The story never ends
,Wound me like a toy spinning too fast
,In every direction
,How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?
,Late at night you pour it out
,Know that only brings you down
,But go ahead give me all the blame

,The story never ends

,That’s who you are
,Crash the car
,And blame the road
,Never your fault
,After all
,I would know
,The story never ends
,
,I err Aimlessly in falling towns
,Looking to trade some time for some way to get around
,Hold fast to my paper crown
,As the howl of the wind
,It blows it all to hell
,I am the king of the ancient town
,I am the reign of the young
,But I have been told I'm the only one
,But I am
,No I am not But I am
,No I am not Well I am
,No I am not But I am I am I am
,I am the fault of the clerics pen
,I am the joke without Within
,I am the call for righteous living
,I am the spawn of a drunken vision
,I am the hope that drives the dread out of the slums for miles aheah
,I am the ad that sold the mould
,I am the billboard for the soul
,I am the king of the ancient town
,I am the reign of the young
,But I have been told I'm the only one
,But I am
,No I am not But I am
,No I am not Well I am
,No I am not But I am I am I am
,
,Rusted and worn by centuries
,I was entoiled by sullied laws
,And now I am caught between its jaws
,I am the scar of my descent
,Destined to be the same again
,I am the circle viciously
,Complete and closed like history
,I am the king of the ancient town
,I am the reign of the young
,But I have been told I'm the only one
,But I am
,No I am not But I am

,I look back upon my time
,See the snapshots of my life
,You will not be surprised
,See your name across my smile
,See your name across my smile
,And I will remember you
,I will remember you
,I will remember you
,The way you are right now
,The way you are right now
,When I first came into view
,I was older than you knew
,Always going out of tune
,Anytime you'd leave the room
,Anytime you'd leave the room
,And I will remember you

,It was a moment for the books.
,The calendar looked
,just like the novels we had only skimmed through.
,So I circled out the dates that I’ll skillfully waste.
,For now that’s going to have to do.
,
,It was the brightest summer day, after we swam in the lake,
,that you told me our luck is gonna end.
,So we better be concerned. We’re where the subway turns.
,We need a camera and some cash to spend.
,
,And our picturesque blame; we’ll put it in IKEA-frames.
,Up on the wall it looks profound,
,and reminds us Oslo is a small, small town. (Yeah)
,
,So it’s night and we dive into a basement that’s alive
,with stupidity that melts into pairs.
,But your good intent was clear when you split and left me here
,to regret I left my high horse upstairs.
,
,And with the way I say goodbye
,I could have ruined everything.
,But I’ll be seeing you around
,because Oslo is a small, small town.
,
,I’m keeping myself calm
,if just for the sake of staying warm.
,So with my eyes fixed on the ground
,
,Went unto this country
,With a waking eye
,Oh the spark was on my neck
,Was in my eye, eye
,Went unto this substance
,At the river end
,Oh the bridge was pulled back up
,Into the sky
,How time did fly for you
,Oh...
,Once I lost my brother
,In the blink of an eye
,Oh the wind was spawning
,Held me up the while
,Want to kiss and steal
,Want to drink and bend
,Oh pull me up beyond the river edge
,How did fly for you
,Oh...

,When I sleep, I'm dreaming

,Spend all day just thinking for you
,When you sleep, I'm thinking
,When you sleep, I'm thinking
,When you sleep, I'm thinking for her
,Wish I still could love you
,Floating high above you

,You thank me all the time
,But now it’s my turn
,Cause truly a word of gratitude so due
,Can’t go unheard
,And it made me feel better
,To have you there in my corner
,My eyes cast so low
,My face could not have been
,Drawn longer
,
,I know you’ve been impressed
,You’ve seen me at my best
,But oh, how it hurts
,When I can’t hide my worst
,Well thank-you for carrying on
,For playing with me and this song
,It made me feel better
,We sat it out like some passing bad weather
,
,My mind was like kid’s boxing gloves
,The kind blown up with air
,That are put away after play
,And get limp just lying there
,But you knew they’d fill up again
,And you gave me your shoulder
,And I got up in the ring
,Because I had you there
,In my corner
,And I got up in the ring
,Because I had you there
,In my corner
,
,Like a sea of gold outside my garden gate
,Behind the house that I grew up in, a beautiful escape
,We talked for hours and hours and look up back the sky
,I had all the questions but you could tell me why
,You told me sunflowers stare back at the sun
,and how the milky way is a galaxy called home
,I thought the moon was a crescent
,and you showed me I was wrong
,I wish you would be a sunflower and stare,
,now that you're gone
,Oh, the rain began to wash away the dust
,I'd never though the gold could turn to rust
,When morning, they were gone and I could cry
,Cause you're not here to tell me why

,I love your eyes when you look away
,Thinking somewhere else of what ought to be
,When they’re suddenly blue for a moment of time
,Then the colour goes when you look at me
,I love your hands as a part of you
,As they write a word just by staying still
,When you talk they move, painting what you say
,So I understand more than words can tell
,I love your hair in the dark it’s soft
,In the light it moves, red and green are brown
,All the time it takes for a night to pass
,And a lifetime grows as the day comes down
,I love you now as you don’t love me
,I can’t let you know you’re too far away
,But I wonder now just what did you see
,When you looked at me in that loveless way
,
,Though you may not always see
,When the rain is falling
,And all you feel’s alone
,Things can seem so distant
,When you roll so far from home
,Though you may not always see
,The forest through the trees
,There’s no reason to feel down
,So rest assured
,Safe in the knowledge
,That I will fight your course
,That I will fight your course
,Whenever you are weary
,For there’s no one that you know
,Who can offer you a shoulder
,When you’re feeling so low
,So rest assured
,Safe in the knowledge
,That I will fight your course
,That I will fight your course
,And if only I could find a way
,To ease a war in mind
,I’ll take all of your troubles
,And cast them aside
,Oh~
,The forest through the trees
,There’s no reason to feel down
,So rest assured
,Safe in the knowledge
,That I will fight your course
,So rest assured
,Safe in the knowledge
,That I will fight your course
,That I will fight your course
,I took my love and I took it down
,Climbed a mountain then I turned around
,And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
,Well the landslide brought me down
,
,Oh, mirror in the sky
,What is love?
,Can the child within my heart rise above
,Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
,Can I handle the seasons of my life
,Uh ah ... uh ah ....
,Well, I've been afraid of changin'
,'Cause I've built my life around you
,But time makes you bolder
,Children get older
,I'm getting older too
,Well ...

,You've got me thinkin'
,Where are we now
,We're falling further from our love
,Don't you wait

,Don't you wait

,
,You could do better I've tried to be clear
,I can be your friend, but that's not what you want to hear
,
,I'm not your answer in time you'll see
,You have a future where you won't need to love me

,I could have faked it but I couldn't see it through
,We didn't make it, it's better to start new
,
,We're falling further from our love
,Don't you wait
,Don't you wait

,Don't you wait

,And time would be a distant memory
,nobody could tell us to stay
,Well I've been dreaming ever since i've seen
,you happy when you came my way
,
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,
,Oh it seemed awfully far for us to find at all
,And all these years we'll wash away and we'll be clean
,though we'll have nothing more
,Well I can say there'll come another day
,where money and our time will fall
,On our hands our wrinkles understand
,we never really wanted more
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,
,And all the life about to go is in my mind
,Cause all the loudest forces in the world
,will never write
,
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,I heard your heart saying love love love
,Woooaaaaaah love love love
,Woooaaaaaah love love love
,Woooaaaaaah love love love
,Woooaaaaaah love love love

,Ring them bells ye heathen
,From the city that dreams
,Ring them bells
,From the sanctuaries that cross the valleys and streams
,For they're deep and they're wide
,And the world on its side
,And time is running backwards
,And so is the bride
,Ring them bells Saint Peter
,where the four winds blow
,Ring them bells with an ironhand
,So the people will know
,For it's rush hour now
,On the wheel and the plow
,And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow
,
,Ring them bells Sweet Martha
,For the poor man's son
,Ring them bells so the world will know
,that God is one
,For the shepherd is asleep
,Where the willows weep
,And the mountains are filled with lost sheep
,Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
,Ring them bells for all of us who are left
,Ring them bells for the chosen few
,Who will judge the many
,When the game is through
,Ring them bells for the time that flies
,For the child that cries
,When the innocence dies
,
,Ring them bells Saint Catherine
,From the top of the room
,Ring them from the fortress
,For the lilies that bloom
,For the lines are long
,And the fighting is strong
,And they're breaking down the distance
,Between right and wrong
,
,
,
,
,My little love, my little love
,Where did you come from up above?
,Where you going to, my little love?
,Your eyes look in mine dear
,And then at the sky
,Your gaze is so clear here
,Till you pass on by
,My little love, my little love
,Where did you come from up above?
,Where you going to, my little love?
,Tears fall and depart
,Though mostly they're mine
,I keep you in my heart
,So you're not hard to find
,Oh, my little love, my little love
,Where did you come from up above?
,Where you going to, my little love?
,Hold my hand, fill my cup
,Smile at my face
,Baby light my whole world up
,My little love, my little love
,Where did you come from up above?
,Where you going to, my little love?
,My little love, my little love
,Where did you come from up above?
,Where you going to, my little love?
,My little love
,My little love
,Sandman sprinkle your sand
,Send me away from this land
,Century's gone
,Battle's been won
,But mostly my life's out of hand
,
,Sandman shut off this world
,Maybe someday I'll be good
,Will you help me
,Sink into sleep
,Away from the cruel mockingbirds
,
,Sandman come back tonight
,in my dreams there'll be someone by my side
,Sandman end all this pain
,while my mind spins across the milkyway
,
,Paper bag people don't care
,Gasping my last breath of air
,The sandman found peace
,In some far-off dream
,And I don't have to be to just be
,
,Sandman come back tonight
, in my dreams there'll be someone by my side
,Sandman end all the pain
,while my mind spins across the milkyway
,
,Sandman come back tonight
,in my dreams there'll be someone by my side
,Sandman end all my pain
,while my mind spins across the milkyway
,Sandman come back tonight
, in my dreams there'll be someone by my side
,Sandman end all my pain
, while my mind spins across the milkyway

,
,Hey there Delilah
,What's it like in New York City?
,I'm a thousand miles away
,But girl, tonight you look so pretty
,Yes you do
,Times Square can't shine as bright as you
,I swear it's true
,
,Hey there Delilah
,Don't you worry about the distance
,I'm right there if you get lonely
,Give this song another listen
,Close your eyes
,Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
,I'm by your side
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,What you do to me
,
,Hey there Delilah
,I know times are getting hard
,But just believe me, girl
,Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
,We'll have it good
,We'll have the life we knew we would
,My word is good
,
,Hey there Delilah
,I've got so much left to say
,If every simple song I wrote to you
,Would take your breath away
,I'd write it all
,Even more in love with me you'd fall
,We'd have it all
,
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,
,A thousand miles seems pretty far
,But they've got planes and trains and cars
,I'd walk to you if I had no other way
,Our friends would all make fun of us
,and we'll just laugh along because we know
,That none of them have felt this way
,Delilah I can promise you
,That by the time we get through
,The world will never ever be the same
,And you're to blame
,
,Hey there Delilah
,You be good and don't you miss me
,Two more years and you'll be done with school
,And I'll be making history like I do
,You'll know it's all because of you
,We can do whatever we want to
,Hey there Delilah here's to you
,This song is for you
,
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,Oh it's what you do to me
,What you do to me
,ohhhhhh...

,
,I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
,Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
,Life is good today. Life is good today.
,Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
,And the city's still on my mind
,Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
,I was still in the baggage line
,Concrete and cars are there own prison bars
,like this life I'm living in
,But the plane brought me farther.
,I'm surrounded by water
,And I'm not going back again
,I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
,a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
,Life is good today. Life is good today.
,
,Adios and vaya con dios
,Yeah I'm leaving GA
,And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
,I'd have no reason to stay
,Adios and vaya con dios
,Yeah I'm leaving GA
,Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
,And grab my guitar and play
,
,Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
,as the summedrew to an end
,They couldn't believe that I just couldn't leave
,And I bid adieu to my friends
,Because my bartender she's from the islands
,Her body's been kissed by the sun
,And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
,and I don't know if its her or the rum
,I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
,Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
,Life is good today. Life is good today.
,
,Adios and vaya con dios
,A long way from the lake
,Its where all the muchachas they call me “big poppa”
,when I throw pesos their way
,Adios and vaya con dios
,A long way from GA
,Someone do me a favor and pass me the Jaeger
,And I'll grab my guitar and play
,
,Adios and vaya con dios
,Going home now to stay
,The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
,You got no money to stay
,Adios and vaya con dios
,Going home now to stay
,
,With my ass in a lawn chair
,And toes in the clay
,Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
,Life is good today. Life is good today.
,
,If I should stay.
,I would only be in Ur way.
,So I'll go.
,But I know.
,I'll think of U every step of the way.
,
,And I will always love U !
,I will always love U !
,U,my darling U !
,Bitter sweet memories.
,That is all I'm taking with me.
,So goodbye,please don't cry.
,We both know I'm not what U need.
,I hope life treats U kind.
,And I hope U have all U dreamed off.
,And I wish 2 U joy & happiness.
,But above all this I wish 2 U love.
,Daring I love U !
,Always love U !
,Are you really here
,or am I dreaming
,I can’t tell dreams from truth
,For it’s been so long
,since I have seen you
,I can hardly remember you face anymore
,When I get really lonely
,and the distance causes only silence
,I think of you smiling
,with pride in your eyes a lover that sighs
,
,If you want me
,satisfy me
,If you want me
,satisfy me
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Are you really sure
,that you'd believe me
,When others say I lie
,I wonder if you could
,ever despise me
,When you know I really try
,To be a better one
,to satisfy you
,for you're everything to me
,And I do
,what you ask me
,If you let me be free
,
,If you want me
,satisfy me
,If you want me
,satisfy me

,I've been in search of stones
,Making up the pavement
,of less traveled roads
,mining for treasure deep in my bones
,That I never found
,
,Went looking for reve..rence
,Tried to find it in a bottle
,& came back  again
,High on a hashpipe of good intent
,But it only brought me down
,
,Tried institutions of the mind and  soul
,It only taught me what I
,Should not  know
,Oh the answer well
,who would have guessed
,Could be something as simple as
,this,something as simple as this
,Verse
,
,Traveled to each oceans end
,Saw all 7 wonders,
,trying to make some sense
,Memorized the mantra confucius said
,But it only let me down
,Chorus
,Tried absolution of the mind and soul
,It only led me where I should not go
,Oh and the answer well
,how could I miss
,Something as simple as this?
,Something as simple as this?
,Bridge
,I     been falling crashing breaking
,And   all the while you were
,stood here waiting
,For me girl
,Chorus
,
,Tried liberation of my own free will
,But it left me looking to get higher still
,Oh and the answer well
,who could have guessed
,could be something as simple as this?
,God knows how I could have missed
,Something as simple as this
,If I could save time in a bottle
,The first thing that I'd like to do
,Is to save every day
,Til' eternity passes away
,Just to spend them with you
,If I could make days last forever
,If words could make wishes come true
,I'd save every day like a treasure and then
,Again, I would spend them with you
,But there never seems to be enough time
,To do the things you want to do
,Once you find them
,I've looked around enough to know
,That you're the one I want to go
,Through time with
,If I had a box just for wishes
,And dreams that had never come true
,The box would be empty
,Except for the memory
,Of how they were answered by you
,But there never seems to be enough time
,To do the things you want to do
,Once you find them
,I've looked around enough to know
,That you're the one I want to go
,Through time with

,swirling clouds in violet haze

,Colors changing hue
,morning fields of amber grain
,weathered faces lined in pain
,are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand.

,You took your life as lovers often do,
,But I could have told you Vincent
,this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
,Starry starry night
,portraits hung in empty halls
,frameless heads on nameless walls
,with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
,Like the stranger that you've met
,the ragged men in ragged clothes
,the silver thorn of bloddy rose
,lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
,And now I think I know
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity

,Down in the watery deep
,Are promises that no one can keep
,Well I’ve spent so many diamonds
,that my crowns almost bare
,And the patches on my heart
,are sewn on with care
,And every time that I hit the floor
,I keep coming back for more

,is again and again

,Steal a beat from my heart

,I once stole sunshine from a desert dream
,I once went fishing in a dried up stream
,I held mountains in my hand
,I wasn’t careful and they turned to sand
,I once met a sweet magnolia flower
,that smelled as soft as the midnight hour
,She stole diamonds from my dreams
,and wore them like a Zingara queen
,And may our scars be as pretty as a pink ole’ Texas sky
,And soft and tender like the whisper of a jackalope’s sigh
,And when we light new candles
,and our old ghosts haunt us on
,May the flames burn them
,away with the dawn
,I met Aphrodite on a summer’s day
,through weeds and the brambles
,She showed me the way
,And left a glass crystal in my soul
,that echoed like a singing bowl
,I rode to edge of a canyon deep
,where the wind was so strong
,It knocked me off of my feet
,Like a banshee out in the storm
,What I knew again I’d been reborn
,So buy me a ticket on this one way train
,Cause the only way to love
,is again and again
,And I’m riding the rails through this hurricane
,Let it rain, oh let it rain
,Take a whisper from my lips
,Sold a breath from my chest
,Steal a beat from my heart
,Put my soul to the test
,Lay my guns in the ground
,and my lies to the west

,To be so in love with you and so alone
,Follow me where I go what I do and who I know
,Make it part of you to be a part of me
,Follow me up and down all the way and all around
,Take my hand and say youll follow me
,Its long been on my mind
,You know its been a long, long time
,Ive tried to find the way that I can make you understand
,The way I feel about you and just how much I need you

,When theres no one else around

,In the spring of forty-seven,
,So the story, it is told,
,Old john sutter went to the mill site
,Found a piece of shining gold.
,Well, he took it to the city
,Where the word, like wildfire, spread.
,And old john sutter soon came to wish he'd
,Left that stone in the river bed.
,For they came like herds of locusts
,Every woman, child and man
,In their lumbering conestogas
,They left their tracks upon the land.
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,Well, they came from new york city,
,And they came from alabam'
,With their dreams of finding fortunes
,In this wild unsettled land.
,Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
,As they tried to cross the plains.
,And some were lost in the rocky mountains
,With their hands froze to the reins.
,Oh...
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,(music)
,
,Well, some pushed on to california
,And others stopped to take their rest.
,And by the spring of eighteen-sixty
,They had opened up the west.
,And then the railroad came behind them
,And the land was plowed and tamed,
,When old john sutter went to meet his maker,
,He'd not one penny to his name.
,Oh...
,(chorus)
,Some would fail and some would prosper
,Some would die and some would kill
,Some would thank the lord for their deliverance
,And some would curse john sutter's mill.
,And some would curse john sutter's mill
,Some men's thirsts are never filled.

,The rain pulls me awake
,on this warm Autumn morning
,the melancholy sky of grey
,comforts like a cave
,You didn't stay last night
,and maybe that's the right thing
,And letting go is truly for the brave
,I tried so many times
,to pick up the pieces
,of this broken moon we left hanging in the sky
,I have no illusions
,Only disappointments
,There's only so much you can do
,For it's time to say goodbye
,say goodbye...
,October rain
,the bitter knowing change
,So let's make love before the snow falls from the sky
,we both saw the sunrise and both felt the pain
,So now let it wash away October rain
,As this cold wind blows us
,through the narrow winter
,the broken leaves of all we hoped for
,fall onto the ground
,I hope you will remember
,The beauty of the summer
,when I found you in the garden
,with your brown hair hanging down
,Sometimes love is wary
,and slips between the shadows
,hides within the darkness
,like a moon upon the wane
,but you still found the way
,through the tangled weeds and brambles
,So I will always think of you
,in the autumn when it rains
,When it rains
,October rain
,the bitter knowing change
,So let's make love before the snow falls from the sky
,we both saw the sunrise and both felt the pain

,Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
,The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
,Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
,Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
,The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
,Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
,But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
,Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
,Oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
,Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
,See she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
,Lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
,Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
,For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
,Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
,Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
,Standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
,Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
,And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
,Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
,Oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
,Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
,Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
,Lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alone

,Picture of the moon,
,You gave to me that night.
,The stars were out to play,
,The moon was shining bright.
,If only I had known
,That it would end so soon.
,I was left with a picture of the moon.
,The sound of soft guitars
,Beneath the spanish skies.
,Across the candle lights
,The sadness in your eyes.
,If only I had known
,That it would end so soon.

,All that's left is a picture of the moon.

,Now that I found you
,Cause you are my heaven
,You are my destiny

,Lying here with you
,Wrapped up in your arms
,Two hearts together

,My song
,Saw you dancing in the late sun
,Reaching for the horizon
,I just knew what you’re all about
,My song
,Saw you fall into the dark soon
,Disappear and be all gone
,I just knew what you must be
,A song rhythm just for me
,Your tone
,Proposing to a bright moon
,The sooner the light comes
,Sooner it will fade
,My song my song
,My song my song
,My song
,Saw you appear in the side shore
,Just in time for your heart is closed
,And then you that you could see me
,Hearing the song rhythm just for me
,Hearing the song rhythm just for me

,If I find him ...if i  just to follow
,Would he hold me and never let me go
,Would he let me borrow his old winter coat
,I don't know
,I don't know
,If I see her standing there alone
,At the train station three stops from her home
,I have half a mind to say what I'm thinking anyway
,I don't know
,I don't know
,There's an airplane in the sky
,With a banner right behind
,Loneliness is just a crime
,Look each other in the eye
,And say hello
,Oh oh oh oh
,And say hello
,Oh oh oh oh oh
,Hey there, how you doing?
,Hi, my name's Mary!
,Hi!
,
,I know I’m probably better off on my own
,Than loving a man who didn’t know
,what he had when he had it
,And I see the permanent damage you did to me
,Never again
,I just wish I could forget when it was magic
,I wish it wasn’t 4 AM standing in the mirror
,Saying to myself
,you know you had to do it
,I know the bravest thing I ever did was run.
,Sometimes in the middle of the night
,I can feel you again
,But I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,And I know why we had to say goodbye
,like the back of my hand
,And I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,A Better Man
,I know I’m probably better off all alone
,Than needing a man
,who could change his mind at any given minute
,And it's always on your terms
,I’m hanging on every careless word
,Hoping it might turn sweet again
,like it was in the beginning
,But your jealousy
,I can hear it now
,You’re talking down to me
,like I’ll always be around
,You push my love away
,like it’s some kind of loaded gun
,Boy, you never thought I’d run
,Sometimes in the middle of the night
,I can feel you again
,But I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,And I know why we had to say goodbye
,like the back of my hand
,And I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,A Better Man
,I hold onto this pride
,because these days it’s all I have
,And I gave you my best
,and we both know you can’t say that
,You can’t say that
,I wish you were a better man
,I wonder what we would’ve become
,If you were a better man
,We might still be in love
,If you were a better man
,You would’ve been the one
,If you were a better man
,Sometimes in the middle of the night
,I can feel you again
,But I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,And I know why we had to say goodbye
,like the back of my hand
,And I just miss you
,and I just wish you were a better man
,We might still be in love
,If you were a better man
,A Better Man

,Jenny grew up wild like a blackfoot daisy
,Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
,Broke as hell but blessed with beauty
,The kind that a rich man can't turn down
,She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
,One summer night in a dime store dress
,She had the looks he had the mansion
,And you can figure out the rest
,It was all roses dripping in diamonds
,Sipping on champagne
,She was all uptown wearing that white gown
,Taking his last name
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,Yeah they're ringing
,Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
,And having dinner at the country club
,Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
,But Ken was always getting way too drunk
,Saturday night after a few too many
,He came home ready to fight
,And all his money could never save Jenny
,From the devil living in his eyes
,It was all bruises covered in makeup
,Dark sunglasses
,And that next morning sitting in the back pew
,Praying with the baptist
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,Yeah they're ringing
,Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
,No law man was ever gonna find
,And how he died is still a mystery
,But he hit a woman for the very last time
,She could hear those church bells ringing ringing
,Standing there in a black dress singing singing
,Fold your hands and close your eyes
,Yeah it's all gonna be alright
,And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing
,Yeah they're ringing
,Walking all day with my mouth on fire
,Trying to get talking to you
,Walking all day with my mouth on fire
,That's what I've gotta do
,Trying to get talking to you
,Walking all day with my feet on fire
,Trying to get closer to you
,Walking all day with my feet on fire
,That's what I've gotta do
,Trying to get closer to you
,Walking all day with my mind on fire
,I can't stop thinking of you
,Walking all day with my mind on fire
,That's what I've gotta do
,I can't stop thinking of you
,Walking all day with my hands on fire
,Wanna get touch you
,Walking all day with my hands on fire
,That's what I've gotta do
,Wanna get touch you
,Walking all day with my heart on fire
,Falling in love with you
,Walking all day with my heart on fire
,That's what I've gotta do
,Falling in love with you
,Murder me
,Make me happy
,Talk to me
,It's so crappy
,Ignore me
,I'm being sappy
,Over me
,What's it power
,Gonna tell you once more

,I never felt magic crazy as this
,I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
,I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
,Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
,But now you're here
,Brighten my northern sky.
,
,I've been a long time that I'm waiting
,Been a long that I'm blown
,I've been a long time that I've wandered
,Through the people I have known
,Oh, if you would and you could
,Straighten my new mind's eye
,
,Would you love me for my money
,Would you love me for my head
,Would you love me through the winter
,Would you love me 'til I'm dead
,Oh, if you would and you could
,Come blow your horn on high.
,I never felt magic crazy as this
,I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
,I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
,Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
,But now you're here
,Brighten my northern sky
,
,
, Take it by your silence
, That I’m free to walk out the door
, By the look in your eyes I can tell
, You don’t think I’ll be back for more
, Try to think of a world
, Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
, Take your heart above the water
, Wherever I chose to go
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No freedom without love
, Even when you don’t see me
, Even when you don’t hear
, I’ll be flying low below the sun
, And you’ll feel it all out here
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No freedom without love
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No freedom without love
, Standing here in silence
, The world in front of me
, Holding you in my hand
, And seeing as you’d see
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No love without freedom
, No freedom without love

,It doesn't hurt when it begins
,But as it works its way on in
,The pain grows stronger watch it grin

,It brings on many changes
,And i can take or leave it if i please
,

,To answer questions that i keep
,is it to be or not to be
,And i reply oh why ask me ?

,It brings on any changes
,But i can take or leave it if i please

,I wrote every line for you
,I made time when time was all but gone
,You’re the love I’ve always known
,The night’s so dark and grey
,But you’ve helped me find my way
,Through the wild and wonders of this world
,So take me with you now
,I need to show you how
,I can love you better than before
,I held every inch of you
,I wrote every line for you
,I made time when time was all but gone
,You’re the love I’ve always known
,
,Play it sweet and low
,We’ve got no where to go
,I am yours and you’re the love I know
,I held every inch of you
,I wrote every line for you
,I made time when time was all but gone
,You’re the love I’ve always known

,To try and make me change my mind and stay
,We never did too much talkin' anyway
,So don't think twice' it's all right
,
,So it ain't no use in callin' out my name' gal
,Like you never done before
,And it ain't no use in callin' out my name' gal
,I can't hear you any more
,I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin’ down the road
,I once loved a woman' a child I'm told
,I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
,But don't think twice' it's all right

,How do you do that girl?
,Make me feel like I'm the only man alive for you
,I guess that's what it is that makes me fall like this
,The first time in your arms I knew

,In restless dreams I walk alone.
,Narrow streets of cobble stone.
,'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
,I turned my collar to the cold & damp.
,When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light.
,That split the night.
,And touched the sound of silence.
,
,And in the naked night I saw.
,Ten thousand people maybe more.
,People talking without speaking.
,People hearing without listening.
,People writing songs that voices never share.
,And no one dare.
,Disturb the sound of silence
,"Fool" said I "U do not know.
,"Silence like a cancer grows.
,Hear my words that I might teach U.
,"Take my arms that I might reach U.
,But my words like silent rain-drops fell
,
,And echoed in the wells of silence
,
,And the people bow & prayed.
,To the neon God they made.
,And the sign flash out its warning.
,In the words that it was forming
,And the sign said "The words of the prophers.
,Are written the subway walls & tenement halls".
,And whispered in the sounds of silence.
,
,He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
,A three car garage, her own credit cards
,He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
,If he could only read her mind, she'd say:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
,And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
,Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
,Would it make a difference if she said:
,Buy me a rose, call me from work
,Open a door for me, what would it hurt
,Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
,These are the little things I need the most in my life
,
,And the more that he lives the less that he tries
,To show her the love that he holds inside
,And the more that she gives the more that he sees
,This is a story of you and me
,So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
,To open the door to a heart that I hurt
,And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
,Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
,I'm gonna hold you tonight
,Do all those little things
,For the rest of your life
,Fever   by wap
,Never know how much I love you,
,Never know how much I care
,When you put your arms around me,
,I get a fever that's so hard to bear
,You give me fever, when you kiss me,
,Fever when you hold me tight
,Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.
,Sun lights up the daytime,
,Moon lights up the night
,I light up when you call my name,
,Because, I know your gonna treat me right
,You give me fever, when you kiss me,
,Fever when you hold me tight
,Fever in the morning, fever all through the night.
,Everybody's got the fever,
,That is something you all know
,Fever isn't such a new thing,
,Fever started long ago.
,Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same,
,When he put his arms around her,
,He said, 'Julie baby you're my thing'
,You give us fever, when we kisseth,
,Fever with the flaming youth
,Fever, I'm on fire, Fever yea, I burn forsooth.
,Captain Smith and Pocahontas, had a very mad affair
,When her Daddy tried to kill him,
,She said, Daddy-o don't do that
,He gives me fever, with his kisses,
,Fever when he holds me tight
,Fever, I'm his misses, Daddy won't you treat him right.
,Now you've listened to my story,
,And here's a point that I have made
,Chicks were born to give you fever,
,Be it farenheight or centigrade
,They give you fever, when you kiss them
,Fever if you live your life
,Fever 'til you sizzle
,What a lovely way to burn
,What a lovely way to burn
,What a lovely way to burn
,What a lovely way to burn...
,I only met you just a couple of days ago
,I only met you and I want your loving so
,Ginny come lately,
,Sweet, sweet as can be
,You may have come lately
,but Ginny come lately
,You're the one for me

,And oh, my love for you has
,no more room to grow
,Ginny come lately
,My dream come true-ooh-ooh-ooh
,You may have come lately
,but Ginny come lately
,I'm in love with you
,
,I feel so unsure
,As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
,As the music dies...
,Something in your eyes
,Calls to mind a silver screen
,And all its sad goodbyes
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool
,I should have known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste a chance that I'd been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,Time can never mend
,The careless whisper of a good friend
,To the heart and mind
,Ignorance is kind
,There's no comfort in the truth
,Pain is all you'll find
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool
,I should have known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste a chance that I'd been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,Tonight the music seems so loud
,I wish that we could lose this crowd
,Maybe it's better this way
,We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
,We could have been so good together
,We could have lived this dance forever...
,But now, who's gonna dance with me?
,Please stay
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool
,I should have known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste a chance that I'd been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,Now that you're gone...
,Was what I did so wrong?
,So wrong that you had to leave me alone?

,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca

,Starry starry night
,paint your palette blue and grey
,look out on a summer's day
,with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
,Shadows on the hills
,sketch the trees and the daffodils
,catch the breeze and the winter chills
,in colors on the snowy linen land.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,Starry starry night
,flaming flowers that brightly blaze
,swirling clouds in violet haze
,reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
,Colors changing hue
,morning fields of amber grain
,weathered faces lined in pain
,are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand.
,And now I understand
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they did not know how
,perhaps they'll listen now.
,For they could not love you
,but still your love was true
,and when no hope was left in sight on that
,starry starry night.
,You took your life as lovers often do,
,But I could have told you Vincent
,this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
,Starry starry night
,portraits hung in empty halls
,frameless heads on nameless walls
,with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
,Like the stranger that you've met
,the ragged men in ragged clothes
,the silver thorn of bloddy rose
,lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
,And now I think I know
,what you tried to say to me
,and how you suffered for your sanity
,and how you tried to set them free.
,They would not listen they're not listening still
,perhaps they never will.

,I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
,Back row of the drive in show in the flickering light
,Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars became champagne and caviar
,Making love on a long hot summers night
,I thought you  fell in love with me watching Casablanca
,Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's Candle lit cafe
,Hiding in the shadows from the spies
,Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
,Making magic at the movies in my old chevorlet
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,I guess there're many broken hearts in Casablanca
,You know I've never really been there
,So  I don't know
,I guess our love story will never be seen on the big wide silver screen
,But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
,But A kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
,Please come back to me in Casablanca
,I love you more and more each day as time goes by
,Oh  A kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca

,Stepped off the plane down in Cabo
,Just meaning to stay for a week
,I got a funny sensation about this vacation
,The second the sand hit my feet
,Taxi driver took my two bags
,He saw me looking at my watch
,He said, you won’t need that here
,Cause time disappears
,In paradise there ain’t no clocks
,You got a lot to learn about livin’
,It’s a different world down here
,Our biggest problem’s decidin’
,What fish we’re fryin’
,Does it go with tequila or beer
,.
,He dropped me off at the hotel
,I took a u-turn into the bar
,I sat down on a stool out by the pool
,Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
,I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
,I tried to make a call to L.A.
,Dang thing wouldn’t work, I started to curse
,Bartender said, I bet it can wait
,.
,You got a lot to learn about livin’
,It’s a different world down here

,Ay, ay... change is in the air
,Now I, I, I... ain’t got a care

,Six months later, I’m driving a taxi
,I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
,Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie

,And the night is like a dagger
,Long and cold and sharp

,Country On The Radio - Blake Shelton
,You ever wondered why country songs
,say the same old thing,
,Like a broken record skipping down on main,
,Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
,You know what I mean
,
,Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
,Juke joints, jumping on the county line
,Heard 'em singing 'bout it a million times
,But I don't mind
,As long as there's a small town
,and a Saturday night
,Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
,Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
,Every time you hear that sly guitar
,And your baby's on the tailgate
,And you're stealing those kisses
,to a little George Strait
,That's how we're rocking,
,that's how we roll
,As long as there's country on the radio
,
,There's always gonna be a party
,out in the pines
,Always gonna be a shot up highway sign
,Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
,From time to time
,
,There's always gonna be people
,trying to run us down
,Saying we ain't got nothing on a big town
,
,I bet come they'd around
,If they came on down
,As long as there's small a town
,and a Saturday night
,Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
,Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
,Every time you hear that sly guitar
,And your baby's on the tailgate
,And you're stealing those kisses
,to a little George Strait
,That's how we're rocking,
,that's how we roll
,As long as there's country on the radio

,Blake Shelton - Sangria
,You're crashing into me
,Like waves on the coast
,Every time we talk, you move in close
,I don't want you to stop
,I don't want you to stop tonight
,We've got the last two glasses
,On a straw hut bar
,Trying to remember what number we are
,String of white lights
,Making your eyes shine tonight
,We're buzzing like that
,No vacancy sign out front
,Your skin is begging to be kissed by
,a little more than the sun
,You take my hand in yours, you lean in
,And your lips taste like sangria
,your lips taste like sangria
,Recking ball dancing down the hallway
,You're holding your shoes
,wearing my shades
,We fall against the door
,we fall into a wild warm kiss
,We're buzzing like that
,No vacancy sign out front
,Your skin is begging to be kissed by
,a little more than the sun
,You take my hand
,In yours you lean in
,And your lips taste like sangria
,your lips taste like sangria
,Only thing
,I want to do tonight is drink
,you like a Spanish wine
,Let you let this head
,Of mine keep spinning
,spinning around
,We're buzzing like that
,No vacancy sign out front
,Your skin is begging to be kissed by
,a little more than the sun
,You take my hand in yours, you lean in
,And your lips taste like sangria

,Let you let this head
,Of mine keep spinning
,Spinning around
,I got my old guitar and some fishing poles
,So baby fill that cooler full of something cold
,Don't ask just pack and we'll hit the road running
,honey what do you say
,I got just enough money and just enough gas
,So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
,Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
,And if the tide carries us away
,Baby we'll roll with it
,Won't think about it too much
,Baby let's just go with it
,And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
,And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
,When the sun is sinking low at dusk
,And wind up a little deeper in love
,Baby lets roll with it
,We get so caught up in catching up
,Trying to pay the rent trying to make a buck
,That don't leave much time for time for us
,And aint life too short for that
,So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
,At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
,And you kick back baby and dance in your socks
,On the windshield to some radio rock
,And we'll roll with it
,Won't think about it too much
,Baby let's just go with it
,And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
,And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
,When the sun is sinking low at dusk
,And wind up a little deeper in love
,Baby lets roll with it
,Won't think about it too much
,Sometimes you gotta go with it
,And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
,And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
,And we have to wait it out in the truck
,We might wind up a little deeper in love
,So baby lets roll with it
,Baby lets roll with it
,Baby we'll roll with it
,Baby we'll roll with it
,.
,You try not to look at me
,Scared that I'll see you hurting
,You're not hiding anything, no
,And frankly it's got me worried

,I mean it when I say
,When you cry, I cry with you, with you
,.
,I'm not going any place
,I just hate to see you like this
,No, I can't make it go away
,Oh, but keeping it inside won't fix it

,But I wanna hear everything you wanna tell me
,.

,If  you  look  really  close,
,There's  a  rip  in  the  sky  and  you,
,Can  see  the  universe.
,Spinning  round  like  a  pin  in  your  hand.
,Did  your  fingers  in  paint,
,Go  and  skip  up  the  street,
,Just  try,
,To  lighten  up  some.
,You're  living  your  life  like  you're  dead
,and  in  over  your  head.
,But  checking  numbers  isn't  how,
,To  know  how  old  you've  grown.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,Say  you  want  purple  hair,
,There's  the  truth  now  the  dare,
,I  think,
,It's  such  a  shame  that,
,Growing  old  before  our  time
,is  just  a  way  to  survive  now.
,Stop  and  look  at  the  sun,
,Tell  me  what  have  you  done  today,
,That  left  you  dreaming.
,Cause  living  life's  not  a  goal,
,It's  been  happening  all  along  the  way.
,And  checking  numbers  isn't  how,
,To  know  how  old  you've  grown.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,Laughter  all  over  the  world,
,Is  doing  all  it  can  to  have  its  secret  heard.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,It's  only  what  you  want.
,
,There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
,You pray more than you breathe
,And you just wanna fall to pieces
,And nights, those 2 AM calls
,Where dreams become walls
,And you just need a break
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest
,Let me help you forget
,When your heart needs to break
,Just break on me
,There'll be times when someone you know
,Becomes someone you knew
,But you'd do anything to change it
,And words you wanna take back
,But you know you can't
,When the page just won't turn
,And it still hurts
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest
,Let me help you forget
,When your heart needs to break
,Just break on me
,Oh, when you need somebody
,When you need somebody right now
,You're where I'll be
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest

,I've been searching
,I've been thinking
,I can't keep rolling like a broken stone
,I've been praying
,Lord don't let me
,Walk through life empty and alone
,.
,No one ever loved me like you do
,You know I've been let down a time or two
,I was all but lost, I was nowhere bound
,You came along and turned my world around
,Ooh
,.
,You've been patient,
,You've been honest
,You asked for nothing but a hand to hold
,You've been fearless
,When you whisper
,A simple promise worth its weight in gold
,.
,No one ever loved me like you do
,You know I've been let down a time or two
,I was all but lost, I was nowhere bound
,You came along and turned my world around
,.
,One kiss, one touch
,One look could say so much
,One dream, so right
,Two hearts are one tonight
,.
,We've been tested
,We've been lucky
,We found each other in this endless crowd
,We've been blessed
,Our search is over
,Forever starts right here, right now
,.
,No one ever loved me like you do
,You know I've been let down a time or two
,I was all but lost, I was nowhere bound
,You came along and turned my world around

,
,I, I don't want flowers
,I never could escape that awful sneeze
,And ha, I don't want
,Sad music, I just wanna hear them laugh
,When they tell stories about me
,Please, tell my mother
,That God sure did a job very well done
,And ple-ea-ease call my sisters
,Like I did, every birthday right at 12:01
,And for you, my love
,When I go
,Close your eyes
,And write my name in the scriptures of your life
,And don't forget me
,Baby
,And promise me
,That you'll love again
,Please,tell my stepdad
,I'm half the man I am cause of his love
,And all them kids
,Running 'round
,Let 'em laugh
,And let 'em smile
,And teach 'em 'bout the privilege to grow
,And for you,my love

,Close your eyes
,And write my name in the scriptures of your life
,And don't forget me
,Baby
,And promise me
,That you'll love again
,I ain't read the book that closely
,But I konw from all they've shown me
,It's possible to find the one twice
,In my breathless final moment
,When my part of your story's closing
,Bow your head,hold my hand
,And smile
,When I go
,Close your eyes
,And write my name in the scriptures of your life
,And don't forget me
,Baby
,And promise me
,That you'll love again
,Oh promise me
,That you'll love again
,I've cussed on a Sunday
,I've cheated and I've lied
,I've fallen down from grace
,A few too many times
,But I find holy redemption
,When I put this car in drive
,Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
,Can I get a hallelujah
,Can I get an amen
,Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
,When I play the highway FM
,I find my soul revival
,Singing every single verse
,Yeah I guess that's my church
,When Hank bring the sermon
,And Cash leads the choir
,It gets my cold cold heart burning
,Hotter than a ring of fire
,When this wonderful world gets heavy
,And I need to find my escape
,I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
,Until my sins wash away
,Can I get a hallelujah
,Can I get an amen
,Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
,When I play the highway FM
,I find my soul revival
,Singing every single verse
,Yeah I guess that's my church
,Can I get a hallelujah
,Can I get an amen

,You don't owe me
,one more minute of your wasted time
,you act like it's all fine
,
,but all the years I gave you
,thinking you knew that you wanted me
,I wanted to believe
,
,I've gotta make a destination
,find where I'll be loved
,This time I've got no hesitation
,and I'll be movin' on
,(to where I belong)
,and I'll be movin' on
,
,I'm tired of trying
,to describe what you will never see
,how that we could be
,
,gave up and lost her
,now you're looking for a little grace
,well look at my faith
,
,I've gotta make a destination
,find where I belong
,There ain't no time for hesitation
,and I'll be movin' on
,(to where I belong)
,and I'll be movin' on
,(Over the line I've drawn)
,I'm already gone
,
,empty corner but I keep movin'
,taking hits while you've been missing
,night after night after I hear you
,
,say we're solid
,but I know we're looking through the cracks
,in our little packs
,
,it isn't hard to leave
,knowing that I'll be getting life on track
,never looking back
,
,I've gotta make a destination
,find where I belong
,This time I've got no hesitation
,I'm already gone
,(I'm moving on)

,(find where I belong)
,I'm already gone
,
,There's no combination of words
,I could put on the back of a postcard
,No song that I could sing
,But I can try for your heart
,Our dreams--and they are made out of real things
,like a shoebox of photographs
,with sepia-toned loving
,Love is the answer
,at least for most of the questions in my heart
,Why are we here? and where do we go?
,And how come its so hard?
,Not always easy and
,sometimes life can be deceiving
,I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
,Mmm' Its always better when we're together
,Yeah we'll look at the stars when we're together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,And all of these moments
,just might find their way into my dreams tonight
,But I know that they’ll be gone
,when the morning light sings
,or brings new things
,for tomorrow night you see
,that they’ll be gone too'
,too many things I have to do
,But if all of these dreams might find their way
,into my day to day scene
,I'd be under the impression
,i was somewhere in between
,With only two'
,Just me and you'
,Not so many things we got to do
,or places we got to be
,We'll Sit beneath the mango tree
,
,yeah its always better when we're together
,Mmm We're somewhere in between together
,well its always better when we're together
,Yeah' its always better when we're together
,
,
,I believe in memories
,they look so pretty when I sleep
,And when I wake up'
,you look so pretty sleeping next to me
,But there is not enough time'
,and there is no song I could sing
,and there is no combination of words I could say
,but I will still tell you one thing
,We're Better together
,I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
,Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
,Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
,Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring
,
,Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
,Half of my heart takes time
,Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
,That I can't keep loving you
,Oh, with half of my heart
,
,I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
,I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
,Lonely was the song I sang, 'til the day you came
,Showing me another way and all that my love can bring
,
,Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
,Half of my heart takes time
,Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
,That I can't keep loving you
,Oh, with half of my heart
,With half of my heart
,
,Your faith is strong
,But I can only fall short for so long
,Time will hold, later on
,You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
,But I can't stop loving you （I can't stop loving you）
,I can't stop loving you （I can't stop loving you）
,I can't stop loving you （I can't stop loving you） with half of my...
,Half of my heart
,Half of my heart
,
,Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
,Half of my heart's got you
,Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
,That half of my heart won't do
,
,Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
,And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never really loved anything
,
,Half of my heart
,Half of my heart
,Half of my heart
,Half of my heart

,Everytime my tears
,Have ever fallen
,I keep 'em in my pocket
,For a rainy day
,So when it's pouring
,I take them outside
,I let the rain start washin'
,My tears away
,But on a bad day
,When hearts are breaking
,There's not enough rain to carry
,All the tears away
,All the pain away
,（Music......）
,Everytime I'm blue
,I take my feeling
,I hold it tighter
,And I don't let go
,When the sky gets whiter
,And the air is colder
,I throw my feeling
,To the falling snow
,But
,When hearts are breaking
,There's not enough snow to carry all the blues away
,Everytime my heart
,My heart starts breaking
,I take this pain
,And I hold it down
,And I wait for the wailing
,When the wind is comin'
,And my pain is blowin'
,Through another town
,Fade out ......
,I'm so tired of staring at the wall
,But I know I've got to put you down
,And I keep trying to make sense of it all
,But I can't keep going around and 'round
,
,And you know me well
,You know me better than this
,And I can't be sure
,if you're something I'd miss
,
,Cause I've heard it all before
,I've heard it all before
,
,I keep finding a little piece of me
,Every time we disagree
,And your words float like dandelions every other way
,I can't keep listening to what you say
,
,Cause I've heard it all before
,I've heard it all before
,
,And I'll take everything I can
,And I'll throw it out the door
,
,Yeah, I've heard it all before
,I've heard it all before
,And I'll take everything I can
,But I've heard it all before
,
,Sittin' here, on this lonely dock
,Watch the rain play on the ocean top
,All the things I feel I need to say
,I can't explain in any other way
,I need to be bold
,
,Need to jump in the cold water
,Need to grow older with a girl like you
,Finally see you were naturally
,The one to make it so easy
,when you show me the truth
,Yeah, yeah I'd rather be with you
,Say you want the same thing too
,
,Now here's the sun, come to dry the rain
,Warm my shoulders and relieve my pain
,You're the one thing that I'm missing here
,With you beside me I no longer fear
,I need to be bold
,
,Need to jump in the cold water
,Need to grow older with a girl like you
,Finally see you were naturally
,the one to make it so easy
,When you show me the truth
,Yeah, yeah I'd rather be with you
,Say you want the same thing too
,
,I could have saved so much time for us
,Had I seen the way to get to where I am today
,You waited on me for so long
,So now, listen to me say:
,
,I need to be bold
,Need to jump in the cold water
,Need to grow older with a girl like you
,Finally see you were naturally
,the one to make it so easy
,When you show me the truth
,Yeah, yeah I'd rather be with you
,Say you want the same thing too
,
,Say you feel the way I do.
,
,I got a home down on the river
,I’m married to the woman of my dreams
,Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
,Everything is perfect or so it seems
,Momma and daddy come by sometimes
,And everything is fine
,My old dog does a little singing
,Late at night when the moon gets bright
,Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
,Let us go and see who’s getting baptized
,We gonna take us a Sunday drive
,Cause everything is fine
,Everything is fine, fine, fine
,Through the sunshine and the rain
,I got a peace of mind
,You know I can’t complain
,I make it a point to thank the Lord
,When I got Him on the line
,I’m feeling good and everything is fine
,Got the same job down at the warehouse
,Ain’t never been rich but I sleep at night
,Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
,She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
,One night this week we’re gonna have a fish fry
,Cause everything is fine, fine, fine
,Through the sunshine and the rain
,I got a peace of mind
,You know I can’t complain
,I make it a point to thank the Lord
,When I got Him on the line
,I’m feeling good and everything is fine
,Wahoo!!

,Yeah, when I was only 17,
,I could hear the angels whispering
,So I droned into the words and wandered aimlessly about
,Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
,It turned out to be the howling of a dog
,Or a wolf to be exact, the sound sent shivers down my back
,But I was drawn into the pack and before long
,They allowed me to join in and sing their song
,So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah
,We would gladly get our fill
,Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
,And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
,For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah
,And my thoughts, they surely were
,Turned to instinct and obedience to God.
,
,
,You can wear your fur
,like a river on fire
,But you better be sure
,if you're makin' God a liar
,I'm a rattlesnake, Babe,
,I'm like fuel on fire
,So if you're gonna' get made,
,Don't be afraid of what you've learned
,On the day that I turned 23,
,I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
,When suddenly a girl with skin the color of a pearl
,She wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
,She was listenin' for the angels just like me
,So I stood and looked about
,I brushed the leaves off of my snout
,And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
,You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
,So I took her by the arm
,We settled down upon a farm
,And raised our children up as gently as you please.
,
,And now my fur has turned to skin
,And I've been quickly ushered in
,To a world that I confess I do not know
,But I still dream of running careless through the snow
,An' through the howlin' winds that blow,
,Across the ancient distant flow,
,It fill our bodies up like water till we know.
,
,You can wear your fur
,Like a river on fire
,But you better be sure
,If you're makin' God a liar
,I'm a rattlesnake, Babe,
,I'm like fuel on fire
,So if you're gonna' get made,
,Don't be afraid of what you've learned
,Well I had a dream
,
,I stood beneath an orange sky
,
,Yes I had a dream
,
,I stood beneath an orange sky
,
,With my brother standing by
,
,With my brother standing by

,
,And you know sister
,
,My hearts been broken
,
,Sometimes' sometimes
,My mind is too strong to carry on
,
,Too strong to carry on
,
,When I am alone
,
,When I’ve thrown off the weight of this crazy stone
,

,

,
,With my brother and my sister standing by
,There was a time when I was never really sure
,If I was ever gonna find that perfect girl
,But then came the day
,When you came my way
,Everything changed
,
,I could tell straight from the moment that we met
,You would always be the girl I could not forget
,In all of my thoughts
,In all of my prayers
,All of my cares
,
,So maybe I've fallen in love
,With an angel that came from above
,You're something to find
,One of a kind

,She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
,
,She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
,We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
,But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
,Until the night
,He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
,And finally drank away her memory
,Life is short but this time it was bigger
,Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
,We found him with his face down in the pillow
,With a note that said I'll love her till I die
,And when we buried him beneath the willow
,The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
,lala lala
,(Sing lullaby)
,The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
,For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
,She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
,But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
,Until the night
,She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
,And finally drank away his memory
,Life is short but this time it was bigger
,Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
,We found her with her face down in the pillow
,Clinging to his picture for dear life
,We laid her next to him beneath the willow
,While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

,Ring them bells ye heathen
,From the city that dreams
,Ring them bells
,From the sanctuaries that cross the valleys and streams
,For they're deep and they're wide
,And the world on its side
,And time is running backwards
,And so is the bride
,Ring them bells Saint Peter

,Where the willows weep
,And the mountains are filled with lost sheep
,Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
,Ring them bells for all of us who are left
,Ring them bells for the chosen few
,Who will judge the many
,When the game is through

,For the child that cries
,When the innocence dies

,If I only had one match left
,I would try to light it between us
,
,If we only spoke with our minds
,I would never look you in the eye
,’Cause I think I might’ve heard some things

,If we only spoke with our minds
,Our lips might find a way to say so much
,Oh little fire sleepy in the coals
,Open up the door see a flame unfold
,Stoke with words you say and the way you say them
,Little fire awaits for you to get close to him
,
,If you only want to stay safe
,And tucked under the covers of your bed
,I would tell you that I knew what it was like
,And of the dreams that I’ve been living in instead

,And wonder what we could do with this love
,If I only had one match left
,If I only had one match left

,Boy you better listen to me
,One day I'm gonna own this railroad
,And everyone will ride for free
,
,Living on bread and wine was easy
,for John and James and Mother Mary
,and I’m no saint and that’s my ball and chain
,Cause when I’m passed that silver chalice
,I always drink my fill until it
,knocks me down and tangles up my brain
,Yeah buddy, it’s a short life, it’s a hell of a life
,it’s a mean old world, when you’re kicked to the gutter
,and the firewater is the one thing to put out the flame
,Walking through the graveyards and sleeping in alleys
,telling myself the same old stories
,Drinking that blood and calling it holy wine
,Looking in windows and seeing a stranger
,going through hell like a fallen angel
,Feeling my bones getting old long before their time
,Yeah buddy, it’s a short life, it’s a hell of a life
,it’s a mean old world, when you’re kicked to the gutter
,and the firewater gotcha talking in circles again
,It’s an empty bottle passing around
,when your hopes and dreams have all burned down
,And the firewater is the one thing to put out the flame
,Take me home, take me home
,Gather me up in your arms Lord have mercy divine
,So take me home, take me home
,Take me home, take me home
,Cause it’s a short life, it’s a hell of a life
,it’s a mean old world when you're kicked to the gutter
,and the firewater is the one thing to put out the flame
,Yeah, the firewater is the one thing to put out the flame.

To drive around till you’re blind
Young and old
Scared or bold

I wanna go sorry
Well I, I’m sorry too
Right or wrong
Which side 
I’m onThe earth won’t ever let it slide
Lonesome man
He’s got a plan
To end it all before his time
I wanna go sorry
Well I, I’m sorry too.

,So long politics it’s time to start being me
,Take the chains off my lips it’s time to set my tongue free
,Some might just turn their heads but some will raise a fist
,And You told me to stand so I won’t back down from this
,They say there are no absolutes but are they absolutely sure
,
,In a world that tries to water You down
,Where beliefs cannot be spoken to loud
,I’ll stand for truth
,Where they claim Your way isn’t wide enough
,And they do their best just to cover You up

,
,Hello reality it’s time we embrace honesty
,Teach me to speak with truth and love and with humility
,You made a promise that You’re coming back to earth
,So how selfish am I if I don’t go tell the world

,I’ll stand for You
,
,They might remove Your name from money
,But You own it all the same
,They kicked You out of school that’s funny
,Cause how could You go away
,In a land that’s built upon Your word
,It’s amazing You’ve been banned
,To think that we control You is absurd
,So for truth I’m here to stand
,
,In a world that tries to water You down
,Where beliefs cannot be spoken to loud
,I’ll stand for truth

,At first I was scared
,The way these feelings started coming on
,I couldn't breathe without you there
,I couldn't see without you in my arms
,I opened up my eyes to find your eyes already open
,I see a piece of me inside

,I am just blood, I am just blood
,I am just a heart that's beating up every second of your touch
,I am just stars, I am just sky
,I am falling to the rhythm of all your endless love
,It keeps me up at night
,Was there a time I lived without you?
,Just living off your air
,Every breath is all about you
,I'm spinning all the worlds around
,To try and rearrange them
,I work so hard to say goodnight
,But there's too much of you left behind
,I am just blood, I am just blood
,(You are just running through my veins)
,I am just a heart (Keeping you alive) that's beating up (Pulsing everywhere) every (Inside of me) second of your touch
,I am just stars, I am just sky
,(You are everything I see)
,I am falling (Drifted) to the rhythm (I'm not afraid, just let me fall) of all your endless love
,Is this really ending?
,Is this really ending?
,All our endless love
,I am just blood, I am just blood

,There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
,You pray more than you breathe
,And you just wanna fall to pieces
,And nights, those 2 AM calls
,Where dreams become walls
,And you just need a break
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest
,Let me help you forget
,When your heart needs to break
,Just break on me
,There'll be times when someone you know
,Becomes someone you knew
,But you'd do anything to change it
,And words you wanna take back
,But you know you can't
,When the page just won't turn
,And it still hurts
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest
,Let me help you forget
,When your heart needs to break
,Just break on me
,Oh, when you need somebody
,When you need somebody right now
,You're where I'll be
,Break on me
,Shatter like glass
,Come apart in my hands
,Take as long as it takes, girl
,Break on me
,Put your head on my chest
,Let me help you forget
,When your heart needs to break
,Just break on me
,Break on me
,Break on me, baby
,You and I walking slowly
,Hand in hand
,Footprints in the sand
,Watch the wind as it plays
,Throwing shadows across your face
,The sky was so blue
,Your eyes so green
,The air glittering
,So sudden, so swift
,Love came to us
,Just like a gift
,I lived here, you lived far away
,Our lives called us back, no we could not stay
,With a sad sort of smile you took my hand
,Said while we're apart you hope I understand that...
,You'll be holding me
,And I'll be holding you
,Through those long nights
,My love will be pulling you through
,When you see the stars
,Pretend they're my arms
,When you feel the air
,That is me kissing you there
,Say you love me
,And I will say I love you
,No distance could ever make that untrue
,When I'm far away
,I'll reach through time and space
,When you hear the wind
,You'll hear me saying
,I love you forever
,Fast forward our love story
,I still remember that day
,Her small precious face
,You stared into her eyes
,Hypnotized by her smile
,But your job meant you had to travel
,But we weren't ready for you to go
,You held our daughter with a sad sort of smile
,Said while we're apart I want you to know that...
,You'll be holding me
,And I'll be holding you
,Through those long nights
,My love will be pulling you through
,When you see the stars
,Pretend they're my arms
,When you feel the air
,That is me kissing you there
,Say you love me
,And I will say I love you
,No distance could ever make that untrue
,When I'm far away
,I'll reach through time and space
,When you hear the wind
,You'll hear me saying
,I love you forever
,God forbid there'll come a day
,When the light in my eyes fades away
,But from your hearts I will not go
,No bounds shall my spirit know, cause
,You'll be holding me
,And I'll be holding you
,Through those long nights
,My love will be pulling you through
,When you see the stars
,Pretend they're my arms
,When you feel the air
,That is me kissing you there
,Say you love me
,And I will say I love you
,No distance could ever make that untrue

Doing hard time just got a little hotter
Way up on the cellblock listen to her holler
Looky here honey if you don't keep quiet
We're bound to start another Brushy Mountain prison riot
Come on we're unshackled tonight
I got a little time off for good behavior
So let's rock it in the Brushy Mountain conjugal trailer
All shacked up and incarcerated
Locked down lovers just a getting reacquainted
Bars on the window, listen to 'em rattle
Tin can jumping like a rodeo saddle
Come on we're unshackled tonight
I got a little time off for good behavior
So let's kick it in the Brushy Mountain conjugal trailer
Give me a slide out double-wide Class A trailer
Wrap it up in razor wire and take it to the jailer
Hurry up honey cause they hang me at dawn
I wanna jive a little 'fore I put my jumpsuit on
Early next morning there's a knock upon the trailer
It's old mister hangman looking for a favor
Hey buddy with the lady if you do some introducing
I'll call up the governor for a stay of execution
Come on we'll liberate you tonight
If you'll allow the pretty lady to stay a little later
And let me in your Brushy Mountain conjugal trailer
(I'm knocking boy)
Come on, wow-wow...

,Lord, I probably owe you tor these tears that I cry
,'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
,There ain't no view
,But there's lots of space in my heart
,The heart that you own
,
,I struggle each night to find a new way
,To pay what I owe, just so I can stay
,I ain't overdue, so you can't throw me out
,I've loved here for years, don't know where I'd go now
,'Cause I pay rent on a run-down place
,There ain't no view

,The heart that you own

She put him out... like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart... he spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink away his pain a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Till the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And he finally blew away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said “I’ll love her till I die”
And when they buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La-la-la-la
The rumors flew... but nobody knew just how she blamed herself
For years and years... she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank away her pain a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Till the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And she finally blew away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
They found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
They laid her next to him beneath the willow
And the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La-la-la-la

,I love to watch the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
,And I feel pretty when you stare across the room at me
,I hear music in my head
,But I swear it's not my own, it must belong to you instead
,I think I see you when I dream, waiting there for me
,Where, how, when?
,Questions circle in my head
,When will I be home again?
,When will winter end?
,Thought I'd lost you at the fork
,Where the road became the forest and the night grew dark

,When will I be home again?
,When will winter end?
,Where, how, when?
,Questions circle in my head
,When will I be home again?
,When will winter end?
,Every day when I wake it’s just the same
,Pluck the ways and I can make my escape
,From the dark fall apart
,To place so far where dreams are
,Then I see your face and you show me the way
,And the words you say set me free
,There’s more to believe and so much more to see
,I’m free, free to be me
,So so many many days in veins I awe the change
,These are the thoughts that jump out brain
,And I’m thinking deeper and deeper and to the whole
,I don’t know where else to go
,Then I see your face and you show me the way
,And the words you say set me free
,There’s more to believe and so much more to see
,I’m free, free to be me.
,I’ve learned to shield my eyes, and I
,And I will drag the sunrise
,Until you…it’s true
,Then I see your face and you show me the way
,And the words you say set me free
,There’s more to believe and so much more to see
,I’m free, free to be me

,I've seen you brought down
,Feathers and all picked yourself up
,For the ones that you call your best friends
,I know you've been fighting what we can't see
,Sometimes it takes many faces to be
,It takes a time and a place to be free
,But in the end
,Who would be so cruel to someone like you?
,No one but you
,Who would make the rules for the things that you do?

,Like a fever that rages in the night
,Spark me up,
,I'm a firework
,I'll burst into light
,For it's better to burn out than to fade out of sight
,That's what someone told me anyway
,So fill my lungs full of smoke
,Fill my belly full of beer
,Fill my nose full of cocaine
,Fill my eyes full of tears
,Fill my short with a longing
,Fill my time with wishing I wasn't here
,Oh fill my past with regret

,Songs Title：song for you
,
,So today I wrote a song for you
,Cause a day can get so long
,And I know its hard to make it through
,When you say theres something wrong
,
,So Im trying to put it right
,
,Cause I want to love you with my heart
,All this trying has made me tight
,And I dont know even where to start
,
,Maybe thats a start
,
,Cause you know its a simple game
,
,That you play filling up your head with rain
,And you know you are hiding from your pain
,
,In the way, in the way you say your name
,
,And I see you
,
,Hiding your face in your hands
,
,Flying so you wont land
,
,You think no one understands
,
,No one understands
,
,So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head
,
,And your throat is aching but you swear
,No one hurts you, nothing could be sad
,Anyway youre not here enough to care
,
,And youre so tired you dont sleep at night
,
,As your heart is trying to mend
,You keep it quiet but you think you might
,Disappear before the end
,
,And its strange that you cannot find
,
,Any strength to even try
,To find a voice to speak your mind
,When you do, all you wanna do is cry
,
,Well maybe you should cry
,
,And I see you hiding your face in your hands
,
,Talking bout far-away lands
,
,You think no one understands
,
,Listen to my hands
,
,And all of this life
,
,Moves around you
,
,For all that you claim
,
,Youre standing still
,
,You are moving too
,
,You are moving too
,
,You are moving too

,I will move you

,How many roads must a man walk down
,Before they call him a man
,How many seas must a white dove sail
,Before she sleeps in the sand
,How many times must the cannon balls fly
,Before they're forever banned
,The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
,The answer is blowing in the wind
,
,How many years must a mountain exist
,Before it is washed to the sea
,How many years can some people exist
,Before they're allowed to be free
,How many times can a man turn his head
,And pretend that he just doesn't see
,The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
,The answer is blowing in the wind
,
,How many times must a man look up
,Before he can see the sky
,How many ears must one man have
,Before he can hear people cry
,How many deaths will it take
,Till he knows that too many people have died
,The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
,The answer is blowing in the wind

,Or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come
,Some days, like rain on the doorstep
,She'll cover me
,With grace in all she offers

,
,Do you remember how this first begun?
,Teeth were white and our skin was young
,Eyes as bright as the Spanish Sun
,We had nothing we could hide
,Now my dear we are two golden leaves
,Clinging desperately to winter trees
,Got up here like a pair of thieves
,While the sirens blare outside
,What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
,What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
,What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
,What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
,But sometimes...
,Do you remember how this started out?
,So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt
,A dirty joke we used to laugh about
,But it's not funny anymore
,I fear I choke unless I spit it out
,Still smell of smoke. although the fire's gone out
,Can't live with you. but I die without
,What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
,What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
,What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
,What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
,But sometimes...
,What's left to say when every word's been spoken?
,What's left to see when our eyes won't open?
,What's left to do when we've lost all hope and
,What's left to break when our hearts are broken?
,But sometimes...
,Every time i think of you
,I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue
,It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
,Living a life that I can't leave behind
,There's no sense in telling me
,The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
,But that's the way that it goes
,And it's what nobody knows
,While every day my confusion grows
,Every time I see you falling
,I get down on my knees and pray
,I'm waiting for that final moment
,You'll say the words that I can't say
,I feel fine and I feel good
,I'm feeling like I never should
,Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
,Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
,I'm not sure what this could mean
,I don't think you're what you seem
,I do admit to myself
,That if I hurt someone else
,Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
,Every time I see you falling
,I get down on my knees and pray
,I'm waiting for that final moment
,You'll say the words that I can't say
,Every time I see you falling
,I get down on my knees and pray
,I'm waiting for that final moment
,You'll say the words that I can't say
,

,And stay, stay, stay, another round
,'Cause who wants to live forever?
,Who wants to burn it down?
,Down, down, down, down
,And we can paint the town
,'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
,So some you win or some you lose
,It's all a catch-22
,Yeah, I could be getting old, but I'm getting round
,Call it immature, sure, but hear me out
,'Cause the only thing promised is the here and now
,If we didn't live it up, never live it down, yeah
,And when I jump I hold on, I'm like, "Oh my Lord"
,If it all goes wrong then it's all my fault
,Man, some just want to watch your world burn
,But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
,Before you play, take a page of my own advice
,It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
,And what's the rush man? Nowhere else to go tonight
,And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
,The choice is yours, your down for the cause
,Be hated or adored, but never ignored
,And whatever card you draw you can't win them all
,So leave the sad songs at the door, get involved and
,And stay, stay, stay, another round

,It's all a catch-22
,Oh, you're not happy where you at heart, fuck it off then
,Just make it not for nothing when you cut your losses
,You haven't got it made, but you got your options
,Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
,What you tryna live longer? Take a bow
,What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
,Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
,Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
,So no politics or parties, even if
,We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
,And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
,Now isn't that ironic? No Alanis Morissette
,We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle
,YOLO the motto, could all end tomorrow
,Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
,If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so
,And stay, stay, stay, another round

,Hey, hey，hey
,Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
,I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I went and let you blow my mind
,Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream I dream
,I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
,Hey soul sister, ain't the Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo,
,the way you move ain't fair, you know!
,Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...tonight
,Hey, hey,hey
,Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
,You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny
,I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
,I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna,
,and I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
,Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo,
,the way you move ain't fair, you know!
,Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...tonight
,The way you can't cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need
,You're so gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of
,You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be
,I want the world to see you be with me
,Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo,

,It's the heart on your sleeve never making me wonder
,It's the bond that we tie up and over and under
,You're the sun and the rain and my grass is always green
,With a kiss on my cheek' always letting me know I'm the birds and the bees
,I'm the apple in your eye
,I know that you know that I know you're all I need
,And just when I thought it couldn't get any better
,There you go and do it all again
,Hope this feeling never ends
,'Cause you o o o o...
,You make me happy
,You o o o o...
,You make me happy

,That everything has got its place in time
,Even the day must give way to the night
,But I'm not buying
,Cos in your eyes
,I see a love that burns eternally
,And if you see how beautiful you are to me
,You'll know I'm not lying
,Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye
,But even if we try
,There are some things in this life won't be denied
,Won't be denied
,I'm never gonna say goodbye

,I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
,Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
,staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
,I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
,Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
,Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
,You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
,Running into the dark underground
,All the subways around create a great sound
,To my motion fatigue: farewell
,With your ear to a seashell
,You can hear the waves in underwater caves
,As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
,
,Time together is just never quite enough
,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
,We need time, only time
,When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
,If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
,So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
,All the time, all the time
,Can you believe that the crew has gone
,and wouldn't let me sign on?
,All my islands have sunk in the deep,
,so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
,I feel as if I were home some nights
,when we count all the ship lights
,I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
,We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
,~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~
,Time together is just never quite enough
,When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
,What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

,All the time
,To start it off I know you know me
,To come to think of it, it was only last week.
,That I had a dream about us, oh.
,That's why I am here, I'm writing this song.
,To tell the truth you know I have been hurting all along,
,Someway let me know, you want me girl.
,Everytime you see me what do you see?
,I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen.
,Oh baby, you're the only thing that I really need.

,You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night.
,You make me wanna hold you till the morning light.

,And could you tell me do you feel my pain
,Don't leave me in doubt.

,And sit you down on the couch
,Pour some Dom Perignon and hit the lights out.
,Baby we can make sweet love.
,Then we'll take it nice and slow.
,I'm gonna touch you like you've never know before
,We're gonna make love all.oh~
,You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night.

,Summer comin' through a rolled down window
,Tearin' down an almost two lane back road
,Freedom and fireflies in the air

,The night's still young, never gonna get old
,Livin' for today like there's no tomorrow
,Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
,Stayin' on the gas like we're never comin' back

,whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
,Everything we wanna be
,We are, we are, we are tonight
,.
,Swayin' back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?

, She’s getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
, She be shaking, riding to them cut-offs baby, oh yeah
, you’re getting of work, catching up that paycheck
, Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
, Here she comes now looking so fine
, You’ve been waiting for this night for such a long, long time
, She slides in and you rode down main street,
, You turn right when that red light turns green
, Sun sets now you’re half way to heaven
, She picks a song you turn it up to 11
, You say “do you wanna?” and she says hell yeah
, So you hit the party all your buddies are jealous
, Someday you’ll be looking back on your life
, At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
, Crowded back yard, everybody’s laughing
, Kinda party, next week you’ll say I was there when it happened
, Coming up on midnight, bout time going
, And then the DJ starts to ?lay your favorite song
, You slow dance for 3 minutes or so,
, and then she whispers baby let’s go
, And then she slides in and gives you the green light
, You hold off till you turn on the headlights
, Someday when you’re looking back on your life
, At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
, Yeah one of those nights
, It is edited by rain
, Full moon through a crack in the windshield
, You hold her close and you’ll never forget how her heart beat feels
, No you never will
, Cause someday when you’re looking back on your life
, At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
, Yeah one of those nights
, one of those nights
, Yeah one of those nights
, one of those nights, Oh
, One of those nights
, This is gonna be

,Stepped off the plane down in Cabo
,Just meaning to stay for a week
,I got a funny sensation about this vacation
,The second the sand hit my feet
,Taxi driver took my two bags
,He saw me looking at my watch
,He said, you won’t need that here
,Cause time disappears
,In paradise there ain’t no clocks
,You got a lot to learn about livin’
,It’s a different world down here
,Our biggest problem’s decidin’
,What fish we’re fryin’
,Does it go with tequila or beer
,.
,He dropped me off at the hotel
,I took a u-turn into the bar
,I sat down on a stool out by the pool
,Next to a lady smoking a Cuban cigar
,I ordered a drink and took out my cell phone
,I tried to make a call to L.A.
,Dang thing wouldn’t work, I started to curse
,Bartender said, I bet it can wait
,.
,You got a lot to learn about livin’
,It’s a different world down here
,Our biggest problem’s decidin’
,What fish we’re fryin’
,Does it go with tequila or beer
,.
,Ay, ay... change is in the air
,Now I, I, I... ain’t got a care
,.
,Six months later, I’m driving a taxi
,I got a Hawaiian shirt and a tan
,Pick up some guy in a Brooks Brothers tie
,I say, it’s time to loosen up man
,.
,You got a lot to learn about livin’
,It’s a different world down here
,Our biggest problem’s decidin’
,What fish we’re fryin’
,Does it go with tequila or beer
,There’s a lot to learn about livin’

,No sir I ain't been drinking
,I ain't even had one beer
,This sweet thing's got me buzzing
,From whispering in my ear
,
,Just take a peek up in here
,At this little hot mess
,Mister, you'll understand
,I'm doing my best
,
,And I know I'm all over the road
,I can't help but go
,A little bit of left, a little bit of right
,It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
,When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
,All over the road
,
,Don't wanna get no ticket
,Don't wanna cause no wreck
,It's hard to concentrate
,with her pretty little lips on my neck
,I say "girl take it easy"
,She laughs, says "it'll be fine"
,How am I supposed to keep it between the lines
,
,Yeah I know I'm all over the road
,I can't help but go
,A little bit of left, a little bit of right
,It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
,When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
,And all over the road
,
,Something 'bout these wheels rolling
,Radio playing gets her going
,I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go
,
,And I know I'm all over the road
,I can't help but go
,A little bit of left, a little bit of right
,It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
,Have a little mercy on me
,Sir I'm sorry I know
,I'm all over the road
,All over the road
,All over the road

,Sellin' t-shirts towels and sunblock
,A Midwest girl who couldn't live without the beach
,I was a local boy who worked next door
,Never seen a smile like hers before
,She put her feet up on the dash of my old Jeep
,It was henna tattoos, tank tops and Ray Bans
,And hearts drawn in the sand
,
,Cause summer flings ain't meant to last
,They always burn too hot, too fast
,You don't talk about it but you both understand
,You get drunk on those boardwalk days
,And that pretty buzzed look on her face
,And it fades away just like a seaside tan
,And hearts drawn in the sand
,
,Sit out on the St. Johns pier
,She drank wine and I drank beer
,And when we saw a boat light blink we'd make a wish
,Then we'd take a walk where the waves hit your feet
,She'd lean right in close to me
,And I could taste the sun and salt on her lips
,And that day would wash away when the tide came in
,Like hearts drawn in the sand
,

,She said goodbye in Tallahassee
,I just crawled in my truck
,Set my mind on Miami
,And my sights on better luck
,.
,Ain’t a man deserves to hurt like this
,It’s a lonely place, it sure is
,Guess I never really knew the blues
,Ever got this far from Memphis
,.
,All the night life and the beaches
,Couldn’t soothe my achin’ soul
,
,And how I ended up in Key West
,God and the liquor only know
,.
,Ain’t a man deserves to hurt like this
,It’s a lonely place, it sure is
,Guess I never really knew the blues
,Ever got this far from Memphis
,.
,Now I’ve run out of road
,So I guess my only hope
,Is to trade this truck for a boat
,.
,Ain’t a man deserves to hurt like this

,Ever got this far from Memphis

,She had a cross around her neck
,And a flower in her hand
,That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
,On our way to the sand
,We found an old wooden chair
,Still warm from the sun
,Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips and I was done
,And we spent that week wide open
,Upside down beside the ocean
,I didn't know where it was goin
,Just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
,I should've known that kind of feelin
,Would last longer than that week did
,Blown away and barely breathin
,Sunday came and it was over
,Now she's got me twisted
,Like an old beach roller coaster
,The rest of those days
,Turned into long crazy nights
,When the music got loud
,We'd sneak away from the crowd under the boardwalk lights
,And with all the things we said
,What I just can't get past
,Is the way we let it end
,Now Im wonderin where she is
,Knowin I can't get that goodbye back
,And we spent that week wide open
,Upside down beside the ocean
,I didnt know where it was goin
,Just tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
,I should've known that kind of feelin
,Would last longer than that week did
,Blown away and barely breathin
,Sunday came and it was over
,Now shes got me twisted
,Like an old beach roller coaster
,She's like a song playin' over and over
,In my mind, where I still hold her
,I had the chance and I should've told her
,When we spent that week wide open
,Upside down beside the ocean
,I should've known where it was goin
,Still tryin to keep my heart on the tracks
,And I should've known that kind of feelin
,Would last longer than that week did

,You make me happy
,When skies are grey.
,You'll never know, dear,
,How much I love you.
,Please don't take my sunshine away
,The other night, dear,
,When I lay sleeping

,Loving can hurt
,Loving can hurt sometimes
,But it’s the only thing that I’ve known
,When it gets hard
,You know it can get hard sometimes
,It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
,We keep this love in a photograph
,We made these memories for ourselves
,Where our eyes are never closing
,Our hearts hearts were never broken
,And times forever frozen still
,So you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
,Holding me close until our eyes meet
,You will never be alone
,Wait for me to come home
,Loving can heal
,Loving can mend your soul
,And it’s the only thing that I’ve known
,I swear it will get easier

,You won’t ever be alone
,And if you hurt me that’s okay baby
,Only words bleed
,Inside these pages you just hold me
,And I will never let you go
,
,And you could fit me inside the necklace you got
,When you were sixteen
,Next to your heart right where I should be
,Keep it deep within your soul
,And if you hurt me
,But that’s okay baby
,Only words bleed
,Inside these pages you just hold me
,And I won’t ever let you go
,When I’m away
,I will remember how you kissed me
,Under the lamppost back on 6th street
,Hearing you whisper through the phone
,Wait for me to come home

,You left your winter clothes'
,And your teeth marks in my skin
,
,So shake the leaves' off the trees'
,Watch them float down the stream
,Your son' your daughter
,Swimming in the water
,
,And I miss you' even when you're around
,I'm a black cloud'
,Sending lightning to the ground
,
,So darling please' show your teeth
,Just one more dance to help me sleep
,cold water eyes
,Fill the past with friendly nights
,Human skin' can be hard to live in
,You'll feel better in the morning
,Wash your hands in the lake
,You've got a heart
,
,Trails lost in the snow
,Make way for winter's eerie glow
,And that black rock in your bedroom
,I hope you'll climb it soon
,In your boat' tied to a tree
,I hope you'll find the sea
,
,Throw me a dream please' it's been a dreamless sleep
,For such a long time' such a long time
,Sing myself awake
,Watch the branches break
,No one could ever take your place
,
,Wash your face in the lake
,You've got a diamond under your skin

,In my mind, in a future five years from now
,I'm a hundred and twenty pounds
,And I never get hung over
,Because I will be the picture of discipline
,Never minding what state I'm in
,And I will be someone I admire
,And it's funny how I imagined that I would be that person now
,But it does not seem to have happened
,Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
,That I'm not exactly the person that I thought I'd be
,
,And in my mind, in the far away here and now
,I've become in control somehow
,And I never lose my wallet
,Because I will be the picture of discipline
,Never fucking up anything
,And I'll be a good defensive driver
,And it's funny how I imagined that I would be that person now
,But it does not seem to have happened
,Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
,That I'll never be the person that I thought I'd be
,
,And in my mind when I'm old I am beautiful
,Planting tulips and vegetables
,which I will mindfully watch over
,Not like me now
,I'm so busy with everything
,That I don't look at anything
,But I'm sure I'll look when I am older
,And it's funny how I imagined that I could be that person now
,That that's not what I want but that's what I wanted
,That I'd be giving up somehow how strange to see
,That I don't want to be the person that I want to be
,
,And in my mind, I imagine so many things
,Things that aren't really happening
,And when they put me in the ground
,I'll start pounding the lid
,Saying, "I haven't finished yet"
,I still have a tattoo to get
,It says, "I'm living in the moment"
,And it's funny how I imagined
,That I could win this winless fight
,Maybe it isn't all that funny
,That I've been fighting all my life
,But maybe I have to think it's funny
,If I want to live before I die
,And maybe it's funniest of all
,To think I'll die before I actually see
,That I am exactly the person that I want to be
,
,Fuck yes
,I am exactly the person that I want to be

,I know that it is freezing, but I think we have to walk
,I keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
,But Julie knows a party at some actor's West side loft
,Supplies are endless in the evening by the morning they'll be gone
,When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
,I'll get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
,With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
,The mask I polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit
,And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
,So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
,But me I'm not a gambler, you can count on me to split
,The love I sell you in the evening by the morning won't exist
,You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
,Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
,Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
,What's so easy in the evening by the morning's such a drag
,I got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
,And if you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
,We may die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
,But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
,And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
,The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
,It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
,'Cause what is simple in the moonlight by the morning never is
,And what's so simple in the moonlight now it's so complicated
,And what's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight

,Can't stop your light
,From reaching my eyes
,Kingdoms can rise and fall
,I won't lose the key If you find the door
,When the mist descends And hope is gone

Something good, oh, something good 
Tonight will make me forget about you for now 
Get high, hit the floor before you go 
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport 
But something good tonight 
Will make me forget about you for now 
Forty-eight thousand seats bleats 
And roars for my memories of you 
Now that I'm fully clean 
The matador is no more and is dragged from view 
Get high, hit the floor before you go 
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport 
Forty-eight thousand seats bleats 
And roars for my memories of you 
Now that I am clean 
The matador is no more and is dragged from view 
But something good tonight 
Will make me forget about you for now
