Let the star , just light , in the dark
Let the flower ,just shine ,in bloom.
Let the rain, just fall, into flow.
Let the stone, just turn ,to roll.

Let the wind, just blow ,in the air.
Let the sound, explode , in your eyes.
Let the snow , just frozen ,into cold.
Let the moon, just burn, in your mind.

Holding you, Holding you.
Let the fire spread the sky, becomes the light
Time will make things right.
Your heart is in my soul.
For you.

Let the smoke, just burn, into dust.
Let the hands, just cross, the street.
Let your skin, just melt, in my blood.
Let the time, just turn, when we met.

Holding you, Holding you.
Let the fire spread the sky, becomes the light
Time will make things right.
Your heart is in my soul.
For you.

,沉淀那彷徨，沉如蜉蝣，定如水流
,跨过骄傲的鸿沟，解脱所有，别无所求
,穿越五彩的宇宙，彼岸若无边，妙不可言
,忘掉自己，纵是老无所依
,无可寻觅，梦境即是真理
,从何而来，终归何去
,这一刻，无需，祈祷
,推开那扇门，不可言喻，逐渐清晰
,似乎在梦里，如梗如迷，如幻如寂
,问题不断重来，答案不更改，不只是爱
,一切短暂的感慨，终抛向云海，永不归来
,忘掉自己，何处皆皈依
,无可寻觅，平凡即是真理
,从何而来，终归向何去

,词曲：白亮

,出品：BL studio
,久的像前世的一段记忆
,不想忘记又不敢记起
,命运在轮回里又到了冬季
,一颗冰冷的心一盘下完的棋
,我终于开始不再想起你
,花了比爱你更多的力气
,那些无辜闪现的种种也许
,此刻却安静的发不出声音
,午夜的车拉着汽笛疯狂的逃离
,还没到家的人跌跌撞撞裹紧外衣
,用那么多颗伤了的心来诠释爱的意义
,对不起
,也许生命中就不该有你
,做过的梦伴着暖意只是梦而已
,失魂落魄的人泛着酒精拿起纸笔
,如果有谁可以预测下段爱情来的归期
,没关系
,你才占据我的前半生而已

不要停下来空荡荡的床
不要敲响
心脏和钟表
捂住我头颅的巨浪
空气里穿织的渔网

不要点着揉进垃圾桶的爱
不要脱掉
肮脏如裙角的翅膀
折进你心如纸夜
打开我身如枭鸟

想要灌醉葡萄酒中的魔鬼
想要抱紧
电风扇去飞
折进你满天星斗
铰碎我身如枭鸟

折进你心如纸夜
放生我身如枭鸟

,远去 这虚无世界
,它带走了我最后一次呼吸
,黑夜 它沉寂下来
,笼罩着城市 麻木的面容
,我还在等 看它是否还会回来
,难道这样 才能看清真实的自己
,失去之后 才是一切蜕变的开始
,无法摆脱 背道而驰
,天空 划出黑色光环
,它照亮了我 沉默的灵魂
,恐惧 穿越了时空
,分开了你我 压抑的笑容
,仿佛一切 都被你我彻底摧毁
,眼前幻灭 只是一种失去的卑微
,他们让你 沦为现实理想的傀儡
,最终结果用力挣脱
,当你想要离开却又停下回了头
,带着所有 属于你的
,不要假装太过天真相信这世界
,没有谎言 你的选择
,当你重新体会 放下何去何从
,生命渴望 突如其来
,深陷其中 轻柔飘过漫长的瞬间
,置身事外灰飞烟灭

,你是三月的莺飞草长
,温柔的风穿过斜窄弄堂
,是捉摸不定咫尺天涯的微光
,你是六月的烈日骄阳
,粗旷的雨洒在炙热小巷
,是触手可及沉默不语的城墙
,你是
,你是
,你是风结的网 雨缝的裳
,是被分割的天空有好多形状
,你是
,你是
,你是雪做的床 雾补的妆
,是被错乱的指南遗失的方向
,你是九月的芦苇荡漾
,忧伤的歌唱进空荡走廊
,是只可经过不能停留的心房
,你是十二月倾城阳光
,单薄的信临摹时间的模样
,你是写不满的纸张字短更情长
,你是
,你是
,你是湖海星光诗和远方
,是等不到的回声格外的绵长
,你是
,你是
,你是风吹过往惹人心慌
,你是仓促的时光来日并不方长
,你是
,你是
,你是辗转他乡 念念不忘
,是微雨打湿小城的一片晴朗
,你是
,你是
,你是流年匆忙 无处安放
,是装点漫漫长途的琐碎日常
,你是
,你是
,你是情诗几行 低吟浅唱
,你是忘不掉的旧事一直在心上

,别跟安全区的幻影坦克攀比 随时能干翻你
,They call me 混世拳王 我目标是重在参与
,现在 速度 立刻 马上一起来吃鸡

,We will we will rock you
,We will we will rock you
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,Yeah, Fort Minor, M. Shinoda
,Styles of Beyond, Ryu, Takbir
,Machine Shop

,I hate it when dudes try to chase me

,Where the people are shitty?
,I like it when we play 1950

,
,I love the way it flows
,I love the way it grows
,There’s something in this sound that takes me far
,It’s like a special song
,Can move our mood along
,But I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar
,She told me add a bassline
,And everything will be alright
,She told me that the groove is mine
,Will take us through the night
,And where I’ll go
,Can’t explain I’ll never know
,But it’s beautiful
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,I love the way it sings
,All the joy that it brings
,Remember skating down the road towards the park?
,I can never say no
,You with that summer glow
,The music is my sun when winter stars
,
,She told me add a bassline
,And everything will be alright
,She told me that the beat is mine
,Will take us through the night
,And where I’ll go
,Can’t explain I’ll never know
,But it’s beautiful
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,

,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,Yo, I wear notes like coats
,Blues like doos, war for the rhythm, soul that glues
,That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
,The hop is my home, rap is my grind
,I'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance
,She threw me a chance, my hands in my pants
,Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight,
,Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
,Look tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
,Wake up and write it on the pad, the pains
,Like church, the organ will invite the tears
,Like birth, the cryin' let you know I'm here
,Held by the song that gave me a name
,Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
,(There’s just a baseline) safe to inhale
,And if you're well
,Be longer years in this state, you will be
,A timeless octave to play for the tree
,That’s rooted in every single nerve in me
,The nerve of he who ignores the key
,And use it to open the minds that be free
,Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
,Beneath the clouds you allowed to see,
,In clarity, through harmony
,Someone harmin’ me?
,That won't be done
,I stand protected by the laws of fun
,I am perfected by the rhymes of Run
,Walkin' this way had the party stunned
,This music, it launched me
,With no aim, I've landed with some plane
,Where I am I can't explain or ever know
,But it's beautiful so
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me
,
,You can’t take this away from me
,The way I hit the melody
,The waves bring clarity
,Running through me

,三 二 一 起来
,
,时候 到了
,然而我的内心是崩溃的
,我特么不想起床啊...
,只想和被窝继续缠绵流连
,一分两分三分完全根本不足够
,翻个身又立刻沉入深眠
,梦境中迟到转眼找不到房间
,从六到从十二 从十二到六
,时间它再次完全清空归零
,说过今天要早些睡的吧
,其实好像已经是昨天了哪
,是从什么时候就在说啦
,要早睡早起健康生活的呀
,然而依旧不知道干了些啥
,总之还是先赶紧睡下吧
,
,不能倒下 不能再闭上双眼
,咬紧牙关 将被子用力一掀
,今天周六 智障
,啊
,
,睡得 好爽
,然而我的内心是崩溃的
,竟然已是下午了啊...
,短暂的白日之间依旧困倦
,沉重而又强烈 意识将坠入深渊
,七歪八斜头不住向下点
,喂 领导老师向你走过来了哟
,只希望天降张床在身边
,抛却一切与被窝继续缠绵流连
,咖啡苦涩于空气中蔓延
,深深叹息中清晰起来的视线
,是从何时开始感受到的
,根本无时间挥霍于睡眠
,无尽的工作无尽的习题
,片刻的喘息后周而复始
,无可奈何这般生命透支
,是否能换来无悔的记忆
,然而新的一天仍依旧是
,再次被闹铃从梦中唤醒
,不要再挣扎啦
,终究要起来哒
,来一起最后倒数
,十九八七六五四三 起来啦
,YouはShock
,愛で空が落ちてくる
,YouはShock
,俺の胸に落ちてくる

,熱い心　クサリでつないでも
,今は無駄だよ
,邪魔する奴は指先ひとつで
,ダウンさ
,YouはShock
,愛で鼓動早くなる
,YouはShock
,俺の鼓動早くなる
,
,お前求め　さまよう心
,今熱く燃えている
,全て溶かし
,無残に飛び散るはずさ

,お前は旅立ち
,明日を見うしなった
,微笑み忘れた顔など
,見たくはないさ
,愛を取り戻せ
,
,YouはShock
,愛で闇を切り裂いて
,YouはShock
,俺の闇を切り裂いて
,誰も二人の安らぎ
,壊すこと出来はしないさ
,引き付け合う絆は
,離れない二度と
,
,俺との愛を守る為
,お前は旅立ち
,明日を　見うしなった

,As I take your hand
,And lead you to the dance floor
,As the music dies
,Something in your eyes
,Calls to mind a silver screen
,And all it's sad goodbyes
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool
,I should have known better than to cheat a friend
,And waste a chance that I've been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,Time can never mend
,The careless whisper of a good friend
,To the heart and mind
,Ignorance is kind
,There's no comfort in the truth
,Pain is all you'll find
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool

,And waste a chance that I've been given
,So I'm never gonna dance again
,The way I danced with you
,Tonight the music seems so loud
,I wish that we could lose this crowd
,Maybe it's better this way
,We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
,We could have been so good together
,We could have lived this dance forever
,But now who's gonna dance with me
,Please stay
,I'm never gonna dance again
,Guilty feet have got no rhythm
,Though it's easy to pretend
,I know you're not a fool

,Decipher the shapes of the blood stains
,Your ID was scraped had no name
,Your body left was white like the cocaine
,That you would stuff inside to feel no pain
,And I hate the god that made you feel so odd
,So you danced and prayed that you could shake it off
,Now the shadows play inside your lonely loft
,So I fight to stay with a heart so soft, okay
,You were my angel

,You don't trust nobody 
,I should have known you were numb
,You were my angel
,Your body breaking
,I don't trust nobody 
,But I didn't give you enough 
,Pick apart All the pieces broke from your lonely heart
,Feel the razor blade your body pierced and marked
,From place it ends till the time it start
,Heaven bleeds
,From the holes that you made in you sleeves
,And I shake and I pull and I scream
,And I rip and I stare and I stay
,From the place that you left but now chest is a cave
,Now my life is a maze
,Now your eyes a blazed
,With the gas of your heart
,And the room is in flames
,With the pain in your hands
,With the pain in your head
,This was never the plan
,Now I'm falling instead
,Rummage through the puke
,Swallow all the blood
,I don't wanna chose

,螢幕裡到處危機四伏　太虛無 
,燈太亮我分不清楚　快中暑 
,我換上晚禮服　
,仔細畫好臉譜　
,一個人美麗而冷酷 
,慢慢變成自閉的奇數　失眠族 
,瞳孔放大也難看清楚　哪有愛 
,原來你是腦中的病毒　太殘酷 
,把記憶中所有幸福竄改 
,冰雪做的雕塑　
,不是冷血動物　
,他也會流淚和痛苦 
,一千層樓上的愛　
,他從未降落下來　
,讓心中的湖變海 
,我們只是個例外　
,是相逢的塵埃　
,天一亮都不(存)在 
,我演烈火誰來演蠟燭　演麻木 
,忍耐又不是前衛藝術　裝飾物 
,下次接觸換一個角度　才能互補 
,名字裡少了金還是土 
,長痛不如短痛　
,沉默不如痛哭　
,感情容易進也容易出 
,一千層樓上的愛　
,他從未降落下來　
,讓心中的湖變海 
,我們只是個例外　
,是相逢的塵埃　
,天一亮都不(存)在 
,燒一炷香再請一尊佛　該吃素

,.... smoke weed everday!
,You ready? Let's go
,Yeah, for those of you that
,want to know what we're all about
,It's like this y'all come on
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason
,to remember the name
,Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
,He just wants to be heard whether
,it's the beat or the mic
,He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
,In spite of the fact that some people
,still think that they know him
,But fuck 'em he knows the code
,It's not about the salary
,it's all about reality and makin' some noise
,Makin' the story makin' sure his clique stays up
,That means when he puts it down
,Tak's pickin' it up, let's go
,Who the hell is he anyway?
,He never really talks much
,Never concerned with status
,but still leavin' them star struck
,Humbled through opportunities
,given despite the fact
,That many misjudge him because
,he makes a livin' from writin' raps
,Put it together himself,
,now the picture connects
,Never askin' for someone's help,
,to get some respect
,He's only focused on what he wrote,
,his will is beyond reach
,And now when it all unfolds,
,the skill of an artist
,This is twenty percent skill,
,eighty percent fear
,Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
,Who would've thought he'd be
,the one to set the west in flames?
,And I heard him wreckin' with
,the crystal method, name of the game
,Came back dropped Megadef,
,took 'em to church
,I'm like 'bleach, man,
,why you have the stupidest verse?
,This dude is the truth,
,now everybody givin' him guest spots
,His stock's through the roof
,I heard he fuckin' with S-dot
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,They call him Ryu the sick
,and he's spittin' fire an' mike
,Got him out the dryer he's hot
,found him in Fort Minor with Tak
,A fuckin' annihilist porcupine he's a prick,
,he's a cock
,The type women want to be with
,and rappers hope he gets shot
,Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
,Now the record with
,Shinoda's takin' over the globe
,He's got a partner in crime,
,his shit is equally dope
,You won't believe the kind of shit
,that comes out of this kid's throat
,Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
,He knows how to work with what he's got
,Makin' his way to the top
,People think it's a common owner's name
,People keep askin' him was it given at birth
,Or does it stand for an acronym?
,No, he's livin' proof got him rockin' the booth
,He'll get you buzzin' quicker than
,a shot of vodka with juice
,Him and his crew are known around
,as one of the best
,Dedicated to what they doin'
,give a hundred percent
,Forget Mike, nobody really knows
,how or why he works so hard
,It seems like he's never got time
,Because he writes every note
,and he writes every line
,And I've seen him at work when that
,light goes on in his mind
,It's like a design is written in his head every time
,Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
,And those motherfuckers he runs with,
,those kids that he signed
,Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
,Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
,Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
,And a hundred percent reason to
,remember the name
,Yeah, Fort Minor, M. Shinoda

,
,It all started from a dialogue I’d a thought nothing of it more
,But she light a spark, right in March
,At the time I was pleasantly surprised
,Her love for the Lord caught the apple of my eye
,And I had to question the timing was impeccable
,We both wasn’t looking but our feelings were consensual
,So we took it and we chatted on a simple basis
,Then I realized that she hadn’t been to many places
,In the midst of park benches and Baskin-Robbins
,Through the thrill and the joy we were thanking God
,and making sure He was the center of our budding friendship
,It was funny how I always liked to read her feelings and get it right
,On occasion we liked
,To cruise around the city night to see the beautiful lights
,In the back of my mind im falling deeper in like
,Cause this girl has the attributes I see in a wife
,
,Lord I pray that in the hardest days
,That you will comfort her in every single way
,And everytime I see the starry sky
,I'm reminded that her eyes
,Ain't too far away far away
,
,A couple months pass we’re talking on a deeper level
,By now im certain this girl is really something special
,Though my music sometimes makes her worry
,I love the fact that she cares enough to think about me
,I wish her parents liked me, but I don’t really blame them
,An educated rapper is a tough reputation
,But I just tell myself that once they get to know me
,That my passion to protect her would be evident, heaven sent
,Cause God knows that the second she smiles
,Its like a bit of sunlight that took a peek through the clouds
,And yo, I know she knows that im trying my best
,To make her days a bit brighter to eliminate stress
,In anyway that I can, through a call or a text
,And remind her to eat if shes preparing for tests
,Cause she likes to forget, and always thinks she’ll fail
,And because of the stress she takes it out on her nails
,
,Lord I pray that in the hardest days
,That you will comfort her in every single way
,And everytime I see the starry sky
,I'm reminded that her eyes
,Ain't too far away far away
,
,Though I cant see you as much as I want to
,I know that God will use you in spectacular ways
,You see 'charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting
,But a woman who fears the Lord, is to be praised'
,Every time the night lights brighter from afar
,I reminisce about nights way back at Shooting Star
,And I know our God knows love, He created it
,The feelings that I have for you have got to be genuine
,It doesn’t matter if im rocking a show or shopping for clothes
,Writing a song as long as you know
,That not a single day passed
,Where I hadn’t thought about you, cared about you and prayed about you
,Hoping for the best I surrender the rest
,And If we’re really meant to be than this is only a test
,I said hoping for the best I surrender the rest
,And if we’re really meant to be than this is only a test yes
,
,Lord I pray that in the hardest days
,That you will comfort her in every single way
,And everytime I see the starry sky
,I'm reminded that her eyes
,Ain't too far away far away
,Lord I pray that in the hardest days
,That you will comfort her in every single way
,And everytime I see the starry sky
,I'm reminded that her eyes
,Ain't too far away far away

,I can't tell you what it really is
,
,I can only tell you what it feels like
,And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
,I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
,As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

,It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
,And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
,She fucking hates me and I love it.

,Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em

,You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em
,Throw 'em down pin 'em
,So lost in the moments when you're in them
,It's the rage that took over it controls you both
,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
,Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
,Yesterday is over, it's a different day
,Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
,Next time you show restraint
,You don't get another chance
,Life is no Nintendo game
,But you lied again
,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
,I guess that's why they call it window pane
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

,Baby, please come back
,It wasn't you, baby it was me
,Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
,Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
,I told you this is my fault
,Look me in the eyeball
,Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
,Next time. There won't be no next time
,I apologize even though I know its lies
,I'm tired of the games I just want her back
,I know I'm a liar
,If she ever tries to fucking leave again
,Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
,I'm just gonna
,But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

,Classical palms' battle my own demons' I need a glass of Patron
,Bad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone' I'm at it or prone
,First time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the 44 buss
,The 44 popped' the first time you seen one' you was eating coco puffs
,Looking at Robocop' I'm not a man' I'm a logo' I'm Sustain

,Vroom! Get respect from the get-go' hello! Step to the echo' echo' echo
,Pen got a mind of its own' got to write my rhymes with a timer
,Otherwise I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
,As the echo follows the Maserati' as the petrol swallows
,I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton' check your bible inside it
,It'll say this guy's an elephant' I'm fly like I'm killing the scene like
,I'm a villain with wings' I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep
,Right now I'm living a dream' though we may be reckless

,We hit it off' i knew it was real
,But now i can't take all the pain that i feel

,
,I just want you to be happy
,
,
,
,
,
,Iust looking back at the world
,from another level you know
,Staring
,Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
,Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
,I wonder when the world stopped caring
,Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
,I will never understand this society
,First they try to murder me then they lie to me
,Product of a dying breed
,All my homies trying weed
,Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennesey
,Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
,Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
,Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
,And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
,I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
,Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
,One love from a thug nigga
,Rolling with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
,To the end my friend
,I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
,While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
,See I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
,While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
,They got me
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Go on baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
,I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die (we)
,Getting high, watching time fly
,And all my motherfuckers
,Now you see him, now you don't
,Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
,What happened to 'em?
,Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
,But all I know I never let the money get to me
,Stay down like the truest
,Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
,Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
,While you thinking I see you lost up in my rearview
,Hear you is down with them Outlawz
,Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
,But still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Now I was raised as a young black male
,In order to get paid, crack sales
,Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
,In the cell, counting days in this living black Hell
,Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
,Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
,Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
,Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
,Heavenly Father I'm a soldier
,I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
,Baby let me hold ya
,Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
,All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
,Now I know the answers to the question
,"Do dreams come true?"
,Still staring at the world through my rearview
,I said now I know the answers, "Do dreams come true?"
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,They got me
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
,I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
,Getting high, watching time fly
,Niggas can die
,Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
,Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
,Bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
,Something I learned in school
,On some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
,True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
,Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
,We all die, breed bleed like humans
,Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
,Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
,Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
,So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
,Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm staring through your rearview
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
,I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
,Getting high, watching time fly, we'll be
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
,I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
,Getting high, watching time fly, we'll be
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
,I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
,Getting high, watching time fly, we'll be
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Scream to God, he can't hear you
,Heart beating fast it's time to die
,Watching time fly
,Staring at the world through my rearview
,Scream to God, he can't hear you
,Heart beating fast it's time to die
,Watching time fly

,I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
,You can’t even get in

,Yellow Lamborghini
,Yellow top missing
,Yeah, yeah

,Ladies Love Cool James
,If you get what I get, what would you say
,She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
,And them suicide doors, hari-kari
,Look at me now, look at me now
,Oh I’m getting paper
,Look at me now, oh look at me now
,Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker
,Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
,Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
,Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
,And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
,Oops, I said on my dick
,I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
,But since we're talking about my dick
,All of you haters say hi to it
,I’m done
,Ayo Breezy, let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
,When you're doing that thing over there, homie
,Let's go
,Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
,And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
,Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
,Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
,See they really really wanna pop me
,Just know that you will never flop me
,And I know that I can be a little cocky
,You ain't never gonna stop me
,Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
,Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
,Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
,Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
,Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
,Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
,A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
,I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
,That I always win and then I gotta get it again, and again, and then again
,And I be doing it to death
,And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
,And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
,When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
,And I bang in the East and I'm banging in the West
,And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
,You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
,Do you really wanna know what's next (let's go)
,See the way we on and then we all up in the race
,And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
,And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
,And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
,Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
,And I gotta cut all through this traffic
,Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it
,Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doing
,I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
,I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
,Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
,I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
,Dressed like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
,You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
,Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
,If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
,I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
,Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
,That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
,I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
,You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
,Not on my time and I’m not even trying
,What's popping, slime?
,Nothing five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
,I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
,Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
,And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
,And my momma's nice and my daddy’s dead
,You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
,I was like fuck trial I puts it down
,I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch
,Okay, okay
,Is that right
,I’m fresher than a motherfucker
,This one's for you and me,
,living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see
,Is a sky full of lighters
,A sky full of lighters
,By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
,I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
,If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning,
,Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward uh
,Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
,This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
,Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
,I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
,There is or there ever will be, disagree?
,Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
,Only thing I ever gave up is using. No more excuses.
,Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
,And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
,Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o'-shit
,Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
,You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
,I love it when I tell em shove it
,Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
,Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
,Brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
,Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
,Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head
,Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
,Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
,Little hussy ass fusses, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
,What difference it make?
,Whats it take, to get it through your thick skulls
,As if this aint some bullshit
,People don't usually come back this way
,From a place that was dark as I was in
,Just to get to this place
,Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
,And let it be known from this day forward
,I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
,So let em bic's raise cause I came a 5'9 but I feel like I'm 6'8
,This was for you and me, living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arms out wide I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see
,Is a sky full of lighters
,A sky full of lighters
,By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
,I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
,My daddy told me "slow down, boy, you goin to blow it"
,And I aint gotta stop the beat a minute
,To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Doctor Dre on the Chronic
,Tell him how real he is or how high I am
,Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
,I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
,So it's only right that I write till he can march right into that post office and tell em to hang it up
,Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
,I stop when I'm at the very top
,You shitted on me on your way up
,It's 'bout to be a scary drop
,Cause what goes up must come down
,You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
,Every hour, happy hour now
,Life is wacky now
,Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
,Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow
,Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
,Ya'll are doomed
,I remember when T-Pain aint wanna work with me
,My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
,Cause now I'm in the Aston
,I went from having my city locked up
,To getting treated like Kwane Kipatrick
,And now I'm fantastic
,Compared to a weed high
,And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches
,on a radio and TV
,See me, we fly
,Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
,And how real is that
,I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that
,Now Bruno can show his ass,
,without the MTV awards gag
,You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
,Forced to fight
,But tonight we're all right
,So hold up your lights
,Let it shine
,Cause this one's for you and me,
,living out our dreams
,We're all right where we should be
,With my arm's out wide I open my eyes
,And now all I wanna see

,
,Damn, take a ride, to my block
,My block, that's right! Heh
,F'real on my motherfucking block
,
,They got a nigga
,Shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
,Cause shit was hectic for me last year
,It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
,The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
,And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
,for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
,Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
,But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
,Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
,And certain death for us ghetto bastards
,What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
,Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
,But don't cry through your despair
,I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
,And who cares if we survive
,The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutching on a four-five
,My neighborhood ain't the same
,Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
,And I swear it's like a trap
,But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
,
,Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
,Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
,
,Living life is but a dream
,Hard times is all we see (on my block)
,Every block is kinda mean
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy...
,
,Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
,Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
,Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
,Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
,And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
,Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
,God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
,So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
,Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
,Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
,Mislead from childhood where I went astray
,Till this day I still pray for a better way
,Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
,From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
,Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
,Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
,
,In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
,I close my eyes and picture home... on my block
,
,Living life is but a dream
,Hard times is all we see (on my block)
,Every block is kinda mean
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy...
,
,And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
,Caught strays from AK's and the drive by AK
,Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
,Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
,Cause our block is filled with danger
,Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
,Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
,All up and down the block exterminating black life
,But I can't blame the dealers
,My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
,Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
,A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
,Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
,Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
,It's a man's world, staying strapped
,Fantasies of a nigga living phat, but held back
,
,Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
,Wide eyed and losing focus... on my block
,
,Living life is but a dream
,Hard times is all we see
,Every block is kinda mean
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy
,But on our block we still prayyyyyy...
,
,And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
,A young nigga learned to break night
,Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
,I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
,I see the same motherfuckers balling
,Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
,I know the young niggas understand this
,Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
,I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
,Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
,Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
,Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
,And what's strange is everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
,And lots of cash make a nigga change
,
,I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
,For all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block
,
,
,

, 作词 : Hale, Mathers, Resto
, Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
, When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
,
, But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
,
, And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
,
, And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.
,
,
, Till I collapse I'm spillin' these

, And you spit and people are feelin' ya shit
, This is your moment and every single minute

, And when your run is over
, Just admit when it's at its end

, It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
, Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
, But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lotta
, Envy
, So when I'm not put on this list
, The shit does not offend me

, Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's
, Heart, what is he thinkin', how
, Not to go against me, smart
, And it's absurd how people hang on every word
, I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
, But I'll never be served, my
, Spot is forever reserved
, If I ever leave Earth
, That would be the death of me first
, 'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could
, Ever be worse that's why I'm
, Clever when I put together every verse
, My thoughts are sporadic, I act like
, I'm an addict
, I rap like I'm addicted to smack,
, Like I'm Kim Mathers
, But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
, The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
, So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'
, On them, the track is on some
, Battlin' rap who wants some static
, 'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that
, I'm Slim matters
, A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so
,

,They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
,Fuel burning fast on an empty tank

,Still driving and striving as fast as he can
,The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
,And long ago somebody left with the cup
,But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
,And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

,Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course

,I forgot how to smile as a sober man
,I forgot how to laugh as a kid
,I forgot what it's like to hold a woman's hand, and not lead her straight to my bed
,I forgot how to kiss and mean it
,Every pause, every slip of my tongue
,I've been loyal to the wants of my lustful heart, and unfaithful to my friend Love
,But you remind me who I was and who I want to be
,You remind me that though not whole, I'm not empty
,There are things I lost in the fire of time
,Things I thought again I'll never see
,But when it's hard for me to recall my name
,You remind me
,You've been quick to dismiss all my apologies
,My confessions seem to only waste your time
,I thought grace was in the clouds among the heavenly
,But now it's staring me right in the eyes
,You remind me who I was and who I want to be
,You remind me that though not whole, I'm not empty
,There are things I lost in the fire of time
,Things I thought again I'll never see
,But when it's hard for me to recall my name
,You remind me
,You remind me
,You remind me

,今天是外婆生日
,我换上复古西装
,载着外婆开着拉风的
,古董车兜兜兜风
,车里放着她的最爱
,找回属于是她的年代
,往大稻埕码头开去
,把所有和外公的往事静静回忆
,外婆她脸上的涟漪
,美丽但藏不住压抑
,失去了爱情只盼望亲情
,弥补回应
,大人们以为出门之前
,桌上放六百就算是孝敬
,一天到晚拼了命
,赚钱少了关怀有什么意义
,外婆她的期待
,慢慢变成无奈
,大人们始终不明白
,她要的是陪伴
,而不是六百块
,比你给的还简单
,外婆她的无奈
,无法变成期待
,只有爱才能够明白
,走在淡水河畔
,听着她的最爱
,把温暖放回口袋
,记得去年外婆的生日
,表哥带我和外婆参加
,她最最重视的颁奖典礼
,结果却拿不到半个奖
,不知道该笑不笑
,我对着镜头傻笑
,只觉得自己可笑
,我难过
,却不是因为没有得奖而难过
,我失落
,是因为看到外婆失落而失落
,大人们根本不能体会
,表哥他的用心
,好像随他们高兴
,就可以彻底的否定
,否定我的作品
,决定在于心情
,想坚持风格他们就觉得还欧颗
,没惊喜没有改变
,我已经听了三年
,我告诉外婆 我没输 不需要改变
,表哥说不要觉得可惜
,这只是一场游戏
,只要外婆觉得好听
,那才是一种鼓励
,外婆露出了笑容
,说她以我为荣
,浅浅的笑容
,就让我感到比得奖它还要光荣
,外婆她的期待
,慢慢变成无奈
,大人们始终不明白
,她要的是陪伴
,而不是六百块
,比你给的还简单
,外婆她的无奈无法期待
,有爱才能够明白
,走在河畔
,听着最爱
,把温暖放口袋

,The time is right
,You hold me tight
,And love is got me high
,Please tell me, yes
,And don't say no, honey not tonight
,I need to have you next to me
,In more ways than one
,And I refuse to leave
,Till I see the morning sun
,Creep through your window pane
,'Cause love won't let me wait
,Not one more minute, baby
,The time is right
,Turned down the lights and take my hand
,We will take a flight
,And spend the night in a wonderland
,Now move a little close to me
,You owe it to yourself
,And I will selfishly
,Take a little for myself
,And it's because of you
,That love won't let me wait
,No, listen girl
,I need your love so desperately
,And only you can set me free
,When I make love to you
,We will explode in ecstasy
,And I won't take the blame
,That love won't let me wait, no
,Love won't let me wait
,My temperature's rising
,'Cause your so tantalizing
,Oh, listen girl
,Love won't let me wait
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Heaven, I'm in heaven
,And the cares that hung around me through the week
,Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh, I love to climb a mountain
,And to reach the highest peak
,But it doesn't thrill me half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Oh, I love to go out fishing
,In a river or a creek
,But I don't enjoy it half as much
,As dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through
,To heaven, yes, I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
,Dance with me
,I want my arm about you
,The charm about you
,Will carry me through
,To heaven,  I'm in heaven
,And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
,And I seem to find the happiness I seek
,When we're out together dancing, out together dancing
,Out together dancing cheek to cheek

,I, had a dream
,That you, were my queen
,And I, was your king
,In the shadows of love
,No one could see
,How cloes, we would be
,Two lovers, you and me
,In the shadows of love
,I was a fool
,To play by the rules
,And I was a fool
,To let you go
,Oh through the night
,When I held you so tight
,Till the first morning light
,But my eyes were closed
,I, had a dream
,That you, were my queen
,And I, was your king
,In the shadows of love
,The shadow of your smile
,When you are gone
,Will color all my dreams
,And light the dawn
,Look into my eyes, my love, and see
,All the lovely things you are to me
,A wistful little star
,Was far too high
,A tear drop kissed your lips and so did I
,Now when I remember spring
,All the joy that love can bring
,I will be remembering
,The shadow of your smile
,oh~

,
,That this longing for you follows wherever I go
,In the roaring traffic's boom
,In the silence of my lonely room
,I think of you
,Night and day
,
,Night and day,under the hide of me
,There's an oh such a hungry yearning
,Burning inside of me
,And this torment won't be through
,Until you let me spend my life making love to you

,Feeling used but I'm still missin you
,And I can't see the end of this
,Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
,And now all this time is passing by
,But I still can't seem to tell you why
,It herts me every time I see you
,Realize how much I need you
,
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her
,
,I miss you when I can't sleep
,Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
,I miss you in my front seat
,Still got sand in my sweaters
,From nights we don't remember
,Do you miss me like I miss you?
,Fuck around and got attached to you
,Friends can break your heart too
,And I'm always tired but never of you
,If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
,I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
,I type a text, but then I nevermind that shit
,I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
,Oh oh, keep it on the low
,You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
,If you wanted me, you would just say so
,And if I were you, I would never let me go
,
,I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
,Wedding bells were just alarms
,Caution tape around my heart
,You ever wonder what we could have been?
,You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
,Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
,Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
,Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
,Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
,I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
,But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
,When love and trust are gone
,I guess this is moving on
,Everyone I do right does me wrong
,So every lonely night, I sing this song
,
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her
,
,All alone I watch you watch her
,Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
,You don't care you never did
,You don't give a damn about me
,Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
,She's the only thing you've ever seen
,How is it you never notice
,That you are slowly killing me
,
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I love you
,Don't want to, but I can't put
,Nobody else above you
,I hate you I love you
,I hate that I want you
,You want her, you need her
,And I'll never be her

你与我同在吗

Be the guardian of all broken hearts 
When the world starts falling apart 
Be the guardian of all broken hearts 
When the planet starts blowing up 
去当所有碎心人的保护者
当这世界开始崩塌
去当所有碎心人的保护者
当这星球开始爆炸
Save us
Are you with me
拯救我们吧
你与我同在吗
A song for peep
My words are freestyling
A song for peep
With the sadness in my dream
My emo prince 
A little broken promise 
The evil queen 
On your way to find us 

一首给peep的歌
即兴的歌词
一首给peep的歌
伴随着我梦中的悲伤
我的emo王子
尚未履行的诺言
在来找我们的路上
遇见了恶毒的王后

Peep:
A song called "Trust me"
I will be like "Trust me" you don't want any of that?
I took 6 Xanax and I was lit
I'm good. I'm not sick
I'll see y'all tonight
,
,I'm tired of being what you want me to be
,Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
,Don't know what you're expecting of me
,Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
,Every step I take is another mistake to you
,I've become so numb I can't feel you there
,I've become so tired so much more aware
,I've becoming this all I want to do
,Is be more like me and be less like you
,Can't you see that you're smothering me
,Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
,Cause everything that you thought I would be
,Has fallen apart right in front of you
,Every step that I take is another mistake to you

,-草ちゃん、あの時、草ちゃんを傷つけたおおかみは私...
,-私なの。
,-言わなきゃってずっと思ってた。
,-今まで苦しかった。
,-分かってた、ずっと。
,-雪の秘密、誰にも言ってない。
,-誰にも言わない。
,-だから、もう泣くな。
,-泣いてないよ、しずくだもん。
,-ありがとう。

,Donnie, what did Roberto Sparrow said to you ?
,
,She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone.
,
,How did that make you feel?
,
,It reminded me of my dog Callie
,
,She died when I was eight
,
,And she crawled underneath the ... the porch
,
,To die
,
,To be alone
,
,I don't know ...
,
,I mean I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just ...
,I've just never seen any proof
,so I just don't debate it any more
,I could spend my whole life debating it over and over ...
,And still wouldn't have proof
,so I just don't debate it any more
,
,It's absurd
,
,Do you feel alone right now?
,The search for God is absurd?
,It is if everyone dies alone
,Does that scare you?
,
,I don't want to be alone
,

,
,-You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life
,You know, like, like, I would always think,
,Uh, what if I make the wrong move?
,But maybe there isn't any right move
,You know? I mean, look at us
,You know, we all dress the same,
,We all talk the same,
,We all fuck the same,
,We all watch the same TV.
,Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different
,"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"
,And see, that's what makes me freak
,Because I can do anything I want,
,As long as I don't care about the result
,Anything is possible
,It is night on planet earth and I'm alive
,And someday I'll be dead
,Someday I'll just be bones in a box,
,But right now, I'm not
,And anything is possible
,You know,let me rank…
,Running away from my pop,hm…
,Searching for you to solve them
,Promised I made it broken(broken…)
,Everything I touched ,I destroyed
,(I-I destroy…)
,-Nothing ever changes, man
,Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead
,And there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos,
,And they won't even know we were ever here
,And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones
,And there'll be all these generations of suckers
,Trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet
,And they'll all be full of shit
,It's all so fucking futile
,I always cry up,shames
,I know I’m not the bads
,I know I’m not the one
,I know I’ll never rising
,He says,these my feelings are
,Or when you see in
,I don’t know how to hand out
,All these things,all I see is no,yet
,You just give in…
,Running away from my pop,hm(running away…)
,Searching for you to solve them
,Promised I made it broken(broken…)
,Everything I touched ,I destroyed…
,-I don’t need no money,e-huh
,I don’t even need a future

,When it comes again
,One shot for our pain

,Hide it in the perfect place can't be found
,“Oh please baby I want you to stay the night”
,This is what I said to ya
,“Oh please baby I want you to stay the night”
,Don't bring me back to the dream again

,いつかまた それは言わずに
,
,踊りながらすれ違えばいい
,そして重なりあった人生を楽しんで
,喜びを体中で伝えながら 微笑みを投げたら
,
,もう一度すれ違えばいい
,そして重なりあった瞬間を楽しく分かち合えたことが
,新しステップへつながる
,だからまわれ まわれ ずっと
,
,手に手をとって解き放たれながら
,まわれ まわれ ずっと
,まわれ まわれ ずっと

,I was busy thinkin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Always busy dreamin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Head is spinnin’ thinkin’ ‘bout boys
,I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
,And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
,That one from work can come over on Monday night
,I want ‘em all, I want ‘em all
,And when they finally leave me, I’m all alone but
,I’m lookin’ down and my girls are blowin’ my phone up
,Them twenty questions, they askin’ me where I’m at
,Didn’t hit ‘em back
,I’m sorry that I missed your party
,I wish I had a better excuse like
,I had to trash the hotel lobby
,But I was busy thinkin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Always busy dreamin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Head is spinnin’ thinkin’ ‘bout boys
,In every city I’ve got one with different ringtones
,Flyin’ from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
,My girls are callin’ me askin’ me where I’m at
,Didn’t hit ‘em back
,I’m sorry that I missed your party
,I wish I had a better excuse
,But I can't even lie you got me
,I was busy thinkin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Always  busy dreamin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,Head is spinnin’ thinkin’ ‘bout boys
,Don’t be mad, don’t be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
,Darling, I can’t stop it even if I wanted
,Don’t be mad, don’t be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
,Missed what you were sayin’, I was miles away, yeah
,Don’t be mad, don’t be mad
,Not like I had a choice
,But I was busy thinkin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,I was busy dreamin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,But I was busy thinkin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys
,I was busy dreamin’ ‘bout boys, boys, boys

,如果人生系得番24小时 你会有啲乜野表示
,好似乜野只不过系小事
,到底系冇谂番几廿年之间有乜野值得比较记住
,有边次活得比较有意义
,唉 由细开始要勤力啲 考好啲试
,我听过唔只一次 全部人都口供 一致
,话我知 入得到大学拎到张沙纸
,入间大公司攞到啲银纸
,先可以 先可以叫做成功人士
,系边个话我知要咁样做人 先至算系有意义
,一出细开始呢一个标准就系最高既指示
,每个人都只系棋盘入面一只棋子
,到你死果日边个可以百分百忠实
,表现自己果日净系谂住八就八终日
,搬弄是非果日 勤勤力力 形形疫疫
,筛演好你自己 呢一个角色 筛演到尾
,问你 点解咁落力
,好似每个人都无灵魂 Repeat又Repeat
,每一日都日复日 系为咗热啲又热啲
,应付月头月尾既每一张 Receipt又Receipt
,为咗所为既康庄大道我哋一直做 一直做一直做咗十年
,二十年 人生有几多个十年
,有几多个人 有几多个梦想从来未曾实现
,最後今天 就算要离开呢个世界

,对现状迷茫 总觉得青春还可以那么长
,回过头俯瞰 十年又很短暂
,留不住那些过往 密友们都在逐个走散
,慢慢淡忘 磨平了最真实的勇敢
,但时间再漫长
,只要还留下羁绊
,总有一天思绪会回到身旁
,那些同伴
,一直想说 谢谢你 最压抑时能陪我说话
,一直有你 让我不曾在深渊中痛苦挣扎
,无论是春树雪花寒冬盛夏 总记得你说的每句话
,不再害怕倒下
,人总会成长 再找不回追忆里的旧时光
,最初的死党 何时变得无法彻夜畅谈
,时间如电光变化 热情和耐性随同渐渐的冲淡
,直到有天遗忘 最后寄语中那句友谊至上
,生命线期望能有多长
,却停不下来无尽欲望
,直到有天面对 一直都站在身旁
,一直想说 谢谢你 最沉痛时能听我说话
,幸好有你 使我再孤单也不会遗憾躺下
,无论是青春时代现在未来 一想起你说的每句话
,就可以为理想执着像傻瓜
,那些坎坷 也走过了
,那些挫折 现在也学会看得透彻
,岁月如歌 永远握不住的
,有你们在身边就值得 不再担心如何不舍
,能握紧的 最后一刻
,拥有这短暂快乐
,来年仍然记得 留下这一首歌
,没观众又如何 就当作自娱自乐
,一直想说 谢谢你 最难受时的安慰说话
,还好有你 让我不曾在黑暗中痛苦挣扎
,无论是青春时代想在未来 一想起你说的每句话
,就仿佛再痛 也无谓有伤疤
,一直想说 谢谢你 面对挫折也不再害怕
,无论是悲痛心寒 花前月下 总想起你说的那些话
,一直想说 谢谢你 无谓冷落也不怕喧哗
,一直有你 不再独自承受那些嘲笑咒骂
,无论是弹指刹那 寒冬盛夏 总记得你说过这些话
,有爱就不会倒下

,This game we play
,We can't escape
,We have to attend
,It's life you see
,When i have tried to amuse myself
,To celebrate the fun fair
,The pleasures i seek
,Are far too discreet for me
,And all the time
,The world unwinds
,I can't deny the way i feel
,The truth is lost beyond this lonely carousel
,And all these words
,They mean nothing at all
,Just a cruel remedy
,A strange tragedy
,Of what will be
,After i tried
,To discover the answers to why
,To look for a meaning
,Inside of this dreaming i had
,And words that i've said
,Are spinning 'round
,Would sing alone inside my head
,Nothing will change
,It's always the same
,Please make it stop
,And all the time
,The world unwinds
,I can't deny the way i feel
,The truth is lost beyond this lonely carousel
,And all these words

,当海风吹凉霓虹 回首你无影踪 转眼旧盟已成空
,赏夜色千家朦胧 风花雪月如梦 提醒我也曾爱过
,苏州河畔你牵我走过
,外滩的夕阳已在记忆中斑驳
,故事变沉默 被岁月淹没
,思念如我 历经漂泊
,站在雨中目送你穿过那渡口
,离岸的船舶漂走远去的轮廓
,惆怅惹灯火 往事渐落寞
,烟波起落 被遗忘的是我
,当海风吹凉霓虹 回首你无影踪 转眼旧盟已成空
,赏夜色千家朦胧 风花雪月如梦 提醒我也曾爱过
,任眼泪划伤面容 飘浮在情海中 横渡春夏与秋冬
,这城市车水马龙 我心事有谁懂 回忆让人更心痛
,为什么
,十里洋场的繁华依旧
,这幅光景也掩不去我的难过
,曾陪我看过 老街的烟火
,缘分蹉跎 花难结果
,是谁赋颂我宛如月下的芙蓉
,床头留声机暗哑缓慢地诉说
,旗袍它在角落 鞋跟都已断落
,红尘看破 你不再欣赏我
,当海风吹凉霓虹 回首你无影踪 转眼旧盟已成空
,赏夜色千家朦胧 风花雪月如梦 提醒我也曾爱过
,任眼泪划伤面容 飘浮在情海中 横渡春夏与秋冬
,这城市车水马龙 我心事有谁懂 回忆让人更心痛
,当海风吹凉霓虹 回首你无影踪 旧盟转眼都成空
,只剩夜色在朦胧 风花雪月入梦 原来我也曾爱过
,任眼泪划伤面容 沉沦这苦海中 横渡春夏与秋冬
,这城市车水马龙 我心事无人懂 回忆让人更心痛
,凉城中
,不夜城的邂逅未断过
,而你的温柔却早已年久失修
,弄堂诉离愁 苔痕如伤口
,我在那头 等你很久

,今夜還有哪可以著陸　能居住 
,我們是被囚禁的字母　好無奈 
,螢幕裡到處危機四伏　太虛無 
,燈太亮我分不清楚　快中暑 
,我換上晚禮服　
,仔細畫好臉譜　
,一個人美麗而冷酷 
,慢慢變成自閉的奇數　失眠族 
,瞳孔放大也難看清楚　哪有愛 
,原來你是腦中的病毒　太殘酷 
,把記憶中所有幸福竄改 
,冰雪做的雕塑　
,不是冷血動物　
,他也會流淚和痛苦 
,一千層樓上的愛　
,他從未降落下來　
,讓心中的湖變海 
,我們只是個例外　
,是相逢的塵埃　
,天一亮都不(存)在 
,我演烈火誰來演蠟燭　演麻木 
,忍耐又不是前衛藝術　裝飾物 
,下次接觸換一個角度　才能互補 
,名字裡少了金還是土 
,長痛不如短痛　
,沉默不如痛哭　
,感情容易進也容易出 
,一千層樓上的愛　
,他從未降落下來　
,讓心中的湖變海 
,我們只是個例外　
,是相逢的塵埃　
,天一亮都不(存)在 
,燒一炷香再請一尊佛　該吃素 
,心煩就念阿彌陀佛　阿彌陀佛　阿彌陀佛

,You want my number?
,I do.I do want your number.
,Which number do you want? George?
,George.I like the way you say that.
,How many numbers you got?
,I got numbers coming out of my ears.For instance,ten.
,ten?
,Yeah.that's how many months old my baby girl is.
,You got a little girl?
,Sexy,huh?How about this for a number?Six.
,That's how old my other daughter is.Eight is the age of my son.
,Two is how many times I've been married and divorced.
,Sixteen is the number of dollars I have in my bank account.
,850-3943,that's my phone number
,With all the numbers I gave you,I guess zero is how many times you'll call.
,How do you remember your bank balance off the top of your head?
,That impresses me.
,You're dead wrong about that zero thing.
,
,I write songs about you all the time
,I bet …I bet I don't run through your mind
,I've given up on you.
,but it still hurts to know you're not alone
,Don't worry.
,I'll keep out
,of your life and stay awake at night
,It's 4am and you're keeping me
,from closing these sleepy eyes
,Does the thought of me keep you up at night
,like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
,Lately,my dog's the only one around
,that listens to my problems
,It's been a lonely year
,
,Da la la
,Da la la
,Every time you touch my skin
,It's like i died again
,My anxious chest keeps on compressing
,What am i supposed to think
,If i try to be
,5 steps ahead
,But this isn't a chess game
,But you're so comforting
,If I could only let you in
,If only you could see this pen
,In my hands while i'm writing
,I think that i'm smiling
,But i feel like crying
,I can't believe you left me
,With my dying breaths
,And the the room that was my chest
,With the door wide open
,Every time you found a key you would give it to me
,We never knew what they went to
,But now something's unlocking
,You're like the sound of wind in the city when I'm walking
,
,It’s just like what happened to us,
,When we tried to bring Mom back…
,You mean almost like us.
,You kept my soul here,
,Attaching it to this armor by trading your arm.
,While for his attempt, he lost it all.
,He didn’t respect equivalent exchange…
,And that’s why we need the stone to get your body back…
,Your arm and leg too, brother.
,Let's go.
,Eh?
,This whole castle's about to explode.
,Why?!
,Cause I don't like it.
,I made some adjustments to the steam tanks.
,It’s just like what happened to us,
,When we tried to bring Mom back…
,
,Alchemists get set!
,
,All war is deception.
,Think your enemy has a weakness and it becomes his strenghth.
,Remember that.
,
,Just end it.
,You don't have to ask.
,
,All war is deception.
,All war is deception.
,Don't call me small!
,I'll break down your feet and stick 'em on your head! Calm down.
,
,I don't know how else to be with you right now
,I didn't really see it, before
,I made a terrible mistake
,I shouldn't have hurt you, I shouln't have broken up with you
,I love you, i understand if you don't feel the same way
,But trust me I'll never hurt you again, I swear
,And i don't know if you're being honest
,I guess it's been so long
,I almost forgot how to smile
,Um?
,Hey,can you hear me?
,Um?
,Um?
,Hey,can you hear me?
,Um?
,Um?
,There's always a way
,I heard your voice
,It cut through the darkness around me

,ゆるして欲しいけど ねえ
,もう一度だけあの店で会いたい

,
,And don't forget...
,I'm also just a girl,
,Standing in front of a boy,
,Asking him to love her
,
,I'm telling you, don't tense up!
,How am I going to knock someone out if it's all limp?
,It's not about strength or power.
,You've got to be fluent.
,Huh?
,You have to be
,You have to be like water...
,You see what I'm saying? -
,Not even a little.
,That's what I thought.
,All right.
,You're gonna get hurt.
,Just do it.
,
,I thought I had it all together
,But I was led astray
,The day you walked away
,You were the clock
,That was ticking in my heart
,Changed my state of mind
,When love's so hard to find
,Your feelings changed like the weather
,Went from clear to grey
,On that cloudy day
,How can I go on
,Without falling apart
,Love's so hard to find
,When someone's on your mind
,Listen baby
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand
,That your wish is my command
,What can I do to make my baby understand
,Something tells me that I'm dreaming
,I can see us there
,Waving unaware
,Of problems that have a tendency to keep
,Keep the truth confined
,Far from our minds
,You need someone you can believe in
,This I do declare
,Trust me I'll be there
,The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
,I will help you climb
,Change your state of mind
,Listen baby
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand
,That your wish is my command
,What can I do to make my baby understand
,Your wish is my command

,Listen baby
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand
,That your wish is my command
,What can I do to make my baby understand
,Follow me into, into my sleep
,Baby I'm yours, I'm yours to keep
,You've got the magic that entered my heart and my mind
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand
,Your wish is my command
,Baby won't you understand

,I am siting in the morning at the diner on the corner
,I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
,And he fill it only halfway and before I even argue
,He is looking out the window at somebody coming in
,"It is always nice to see you"
,say the man behind the counter to the woman who has come in
,She is shaking her umbrella
,And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
,I'm pretending not to see them
,Instead I pour the milk
,I open up the paper
,There's a story of a actor
,Who has died while he was drinking
,It was no one I had heard of
,And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
,When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head
,There's a woman on the outside looking inside
,Does she see me?
,No she does not really see me cause she sees her own reflection
,And I'm trying hot to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
,And while she's straightening her stockings her hair is getting wet
,Oh, this rain it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
,To the bells of the cathedral
,I'm thinking of your voice...

,Let own my guard today,
,You took my heart away.
,Now I'm alone on a bench made for two.
,Clutching this red balloon
,Filled up with thoughts of you
,Open my hand and it pressed to the sky of blue.
,This is a call for freedom
,I'm too scared, too scared
,Of letting my mind start to reason
,In hope that you care for me.
,Rip my heart off my sleeve,
,'cause loving you could be the death of me.
,Now that my thoughts are sane,
,Hooked on a North-bound plane
,Off to a city that's absent of you.
,Something that caught my eye,
,Passing through painted skies
,Glimpse out the window a small red balloon.
,This is a call for freedom
,I'm too scared, too scared
,Of letting my mind start to reason
,In hope that you care for me.
,Rip my heart off my sleeve,
,'cause loving you could be the death of me.
,I'll take my heart
,I'll take my mind
,I'll take my eyes off you.
,I'm too scared, I'm too scared.
,I'll take my heart
,I'll take my mind
,I'll take my eyes off you.
,Can't hope that you care for me
,Rip my heart off my sleeve,
,'cause loving you could be the death of me.
,
,No one calls me beautiful like you
,And i love how you say it to
,Every word from you is filled with wonder
,I wonder why you love me but you do
,
,And i would be a fool to argue with you
,Maybe i'd be wasting my time
,You've given me your word
,And based on what i've heard
,You must love me
,Really love me
,
,No one knows me as deeply as you do
,Still I'm the one you choose
,Even though i prove I don't deserve you
,I don't deserve the love you say is true
,
,And i would be a fool to argue with you
,Maybe i'd be wasting my time
,You've given me your word
,And based on what i've heard
,You must love me
,Really love me
,
,I swear that I am dreaming
,When I kiss your lips
,Is it that we're in love
,Or just little kids
,I'm learning to let go
,When will I know
,
,I don't feel that lucky
,Even with my girl
,Even if she loves me
,There is so much in this world
,I'm learning to let go
,When will I know
,When will I know
,What you see in ink blots painted
,Smashed like Rorschachs jaded
,The collision of our lives was slow
,I'm learning to let go
,
,Tell me that it's over
,I won't feel that bad
,Even if you cheated
,I'll know that I've been had
,I'm learning to let go
,When will I know
,When will I know
,What you see in ink blots painted
,Smashed like Rorschachs jaded
,The collision of our lives was slow
,I'm learning to let go
,I'm learning to let go
,When will I know
It's everywhere I look
From Las Vegas to right here
Under your dresser
Right by your ear
It's creeping in sweetly
It's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear
 
Life was full and fruitful
And you could take a real bite
The juice poring well over
Your skin delight
But the shadows it grows
And takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this priceless ballet
 
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
 
Did we bulid all thoese bridges
To watch them thin down to dust
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't on party with weathering frocks
 
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
 
Heading deeper down
We're sliding without noticing
Our own decline
Heading deeper down
We're heading onto
Sweet nothings left behind
 
 
Deeper down...
We're all going down
Down deeper down
 
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing
We slide
Down
Deeper down
The shadows grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight
Into the fade out line
 
 
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
 
 
Está en todas partes me veo
Desde Las Vegas hasta aquí
Bajo su tocador
Justo al lado de su oído
Es progresiva en dulce
Es, definitivamente, aquí
No hay nada más mortal
Que el miedo de crecimiento lento
 
La vida era plena y fructífera
Y usted podría tomar un bocado reales
El jugo de estudiar minuciosamente más de
Su piel placer
Pero la sombra que crece
Y tiene la profundidad de distancia
Dejando desglosado piezas
Para este ballet tiene precio
 
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida
 
¿Hemos bulid todos los puentes thoese
Para ver los delgados hasta el polvo
O hacerlos volar voluntariamente
Fuera de la confianza constante
El reloj está corriendo su último par de nalgas
Y no habrá en la fiesta con vestidos de la intemperie
 
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida
 
La partida más abajo
Estamos deslizando sin darse cuenta
Nuestra propia decadencia
La partida más abajo
Nos dirigimos a
Palabras de amor dejado atrás
 
 
A mayor profundidad ...
Todos vamos hacia abajo
Abajo a mayor profundidad
 
Todos estamos hundiendo en línea recta hacia nuestra propia decadencia
sin darse cuenta
nos deslizamos
abajo
a mayor profundidad
La sombra crece sin ralentización
Nos dirigimos directamente
En la línea de fundido de salida
 
 
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida
La más superficial crece
La más superficial crece
Los más débiles se van
En la línea de fundido de salida

,I try to live with my mistake
,So I stay awake to ease all pain
,But I've never been very good at playing that game
,No I've never been very good at anything
,Forget the past it's just an ugly background
,That stains everything we try to believe in
,And except the things that failed love brings
,And don't project it onto anyone else
,and don't project it onto anyone else
,I've been trying to do it right
,I've been living a lonely life

,So i do some gardening
,Anything to take my mind away from where it's s'posed to be.
,The nice lady next door talks of green beds
,And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
,I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps.
,Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes.

,不会太平歌词是件丢人的事情
,人家都挣一百，你挣七十五
,因为你差一门功课
,这个太平歌词来说呢，比较简单
,也没有伴奏的，也没有伴舞的
,就是一个人，拿着两块小，小竹片
,我这是木头的，两块小板
,敲着节奏，全凭肉嗓子唱
,也没有别人帮忙，也没有伴舞的
,我倒是试过，我找了十个俄罗斯的美女

,观众很喜欢

,隋炀帝无道行事凶，弑父夺权理不通。
,他鸩兄图嫂把伦理丧，欺娘戏妹把纲常二字一旁扔。
,许多的老忠良啊辞了王驾，一位位退归林下隐蔽身形。
,在朝中，出了一位宇文化及，还有那杨素老奸佞。
,萧妃拐驾在天心府，隋炀帝下扬州(这个)观琼花走一程。　
,那平地里行船开了河路，他把那谷子、香油里边盛。
,抓来了童男童女来拉纤，那一个个脱去了衣衫就露着身形。
,船行在中途中把绒绳割断，也不论男女栽在了流平。
,因此上冬无瑞雪夏没有雨，上天差下了左天蓬。
,这天蓬帅降生在山东郡，有群雄聚义服保唐宗。
,贾家楼三十六友曾结拜，刺血为盟酒染红。
,那程咬金尤通劫过了皇纲，五花绑拷打老杨林。
,因此上两家结下了仇恨，那秦叔宝两肋插刀就救过了宾朋。
,也是这位秦二爷身遭大难，在这沿海登州遇见了杨林。　
,靠山王摆下一座四门兜底锁子八卦连环阵，他要害秦琼的命残生。
,秦二爷好比是馒首馅儿，围了个里七层啊外八层不透风。
,头层兵藤子枪枪衬着鸭子嘴，二层兵拧着眉啊瞪着眼叉着腰点火绳。
,三层兵具是藤牌手，观四层啊马步儿啊怀抱着短刀逞英雄。
,观东方青铜刀大砍刀刀光偃月，观南方八棱锤啊渗金锤啊锤似流星，　
,观西方提颅枪亮银枪枪似战杆，观北方啊五股叉呀托天叉布满了蛟龙。
,观东方青龙驹相衬着花斑豹，观南方赤兔马相衬着马桃红，　
,观西方啊雪丝白相衬着白龙的马，观北方啊乌骓马相衬着马乌龙。
,观东方甲乙木绿旗招展，观南方丙丁火红旗遮蒙，
,观西方庚辛金白旗他如同雪浸，观北方啊壬癸水呀皂角旗呀墨把它染成，
,观中央戊己土龙旗高挑，在这刁斗站立着一兵丁。
,手拿令旗滴溜溜溜儿转，在疆场调动百万兵。　　
,那秦二爷看罢了多一会，翻身下了马能行。
,眼望山东落下了泪，养儿老娘哭叫几声。
,人家养儿都防备老，您老人家养儿这个竹篮打水落了场空。　　
,我是实指望孩儿我做高官增光耀祖，不料想半路途中遇见险情。
,靠山王摆下一座四门兜底锁子八卦连环阵，他要害孩儿的命残生。　　
,磕一个头来我算尽了孝，磕两个头来我算尽了忠。　　
,那秦二爷连磕了头三个，也算尽孝也算尽忠。　
,磕罢了头他是忙站起，眼望黄骠把话明:
,“你今天驮顶我闯得出正东、正西、东南、东北、西南、西北，刀枪剑戟、斧钺钩叉、镗棍槊棒、鞭锏锤爪、拐子流星四门兜底锁子八卦连环阵，疆场以上你立了大功。”　
,“你今天驮顶我闯不出正东、正西、东南、东北、西南、西北，刀枪剑戟、斧钺钩叉、镗棍槊棒、鞭锏锤爪、拐子流星四门兜底锁子八卦连环阵，疆场以上你活不成。"
,这匹马懂得人言善听兽语，咴儿咴儿大叫两三声。
,秦二爷马上高断喝，骂了声贼子你叫杨林，

,我一言唱不尽这秦琼观阵，我是愿诸位，居家欢乐是福寿康宁。
走来走去，走到了半路途中，前边队伍不走了，说郡马爷，咱们不能走了。“啊？怎么啦？为什么不能走啊？”“有人劫道，您瞧瞧吧。”“我看看。”两旁边的兵丁雁别翅闪开，往前一摧马吴起定睛观瞧，对面站着一个僧人，这大脑袋呀比那灯笼不小，挺大挺圆。大耳朵，挂着大金环。一脸的横丝肉，底下呢有这么两寸多的胡子茬。最要紧的是这张嘴与众不同，大嘴叉，要没有这耳朵挡着能咧到后脑勺去，血盆大口，手里边拿着一把戒刀。胸前佩戴的这挂数珠，一个个都跟馒头这么大。往这一站是一团的杀气。吴起一瞧：“这位师傅，您是哪位呀？我与您从来不认识，为何阻住我的去路？”“弥陀佛！！”吴起心说怎么意思？还有话佐料呢？“您是……”“你是吴起吗？”“是我呀。”“哈哈哈哈哈哈，你不认识我呀，江湖上我叫血葫芦僧！”“血葫芦僧？”“诶？倒是有这么个耳闻，说有一位出家人马上步下了不起，而且还有神通。”这人是半仙之体，大和尚叫血葫芦。“哦～您恕我眼拙，您就是高僧血葫芦吗？”“不错！正是贫僧。”“真是久仰啊，只是不知道您为什么叫血葫芦呢？”“哈哈哈哈，我也不知道啊。当初我学艺的时候，我师傅说你叫血葫芦，日后你就明白了，这不到今天我也没明白吗？哈哈哈。”“哦，是，大师傅，拦住我的去路有什么事吗？”“哈哈哈，吴大将军那，你是了不起的能人呀，啊？这一次难道说你是从临淄城混出来的么？”“唉，大师傅，不提了，这个事啊，我一说起来心都难受。”“你甭说了，我知道，你这是打算奔楚国吧？”“对呀，大师傅，您怎么知道？”“我能掐会算，前知五百年，后知五百载，你是打算投奔楚成王，借兵复仇，反攻大齐，对不对？”“诶呀，师傅您算得太准啦！诶呀，您看我这一去能成功吗？”“嗯，看吧。我估计你能成功！为什么呢？要是你自己去未必，有我陪着你这仗你是准赢。”“诶呀师傅，我怎么谢您哪？！”“别客气，哈哈哈，你带着干粮那吗？贫僧在这等你等了半个多月了，肚中饥饿。”“有！有有有有，给大师傅预备吃的。”有人给拉过马来，随军带的一些吃的给他吃。一边在马上吃着东西一边往楚国走。在路上，血葫芦告诉他：“别担心，一切都有我呢，只要你听我的，保证你打赢这场仗。重返大齐，以后大齐的疆土有你的，”诶呀，高兴坏了，“我说大师傅，您算的这么准吗？这大齐的疆土真有我？”“你放心，哈，以后啊，这大齐的社稷都有你的，大齐的江山也是你的，有朝一日你去世了，你的尸体也要埋在大齐。”“好，我借您吉言，借您吉言。”一路来在了楚国，吩咐人往里通传，说吴起晋见。楚成王啊，正在殿上坐着呢，嘶？一琢磨啊？吴起来了？听说他是齐国的郡马呀？他来有什么事呢？和文臣武将一商量，你们说这事怎么办呢？文臣武将一琢磨：“我估计他来呀，投降咱们的面大，不管怎么说，让他进来，咱当殿问一问他。”楚王说：“可以。”功夫不大，由打底下上来仨人，头里走着的血葫芦僧，后边跟着的吴起两口子。啊~这边这个是菱花郡主，这边这个是吴起，来到了银安殿上是飘飘下拜。两位扑腾跪下了。楚王赶紧客气客气：“快快请起快快请起，来呀，赐秀墩。”有太监搬过凳子来，仨人坐好了。楚王说：“三位呀，今天来到我们这，有什么事吗？”没说话吴起眼泪下来了：“大王千岁，我求您来了，没有别的，啊？我与大齐是一天二地仇，三江四海恨。此生不灭大齐我就不活着了。”把自己的经历一说，他可没说怎么勾搭夏迎春，这个都没提，就说齐宣王怎么怎么坏，无盐娘娘怎么怎么狠。把这事一说，楚王一琢磨：“诶呀，吴郡马呀，这个事是这样，嗯，您来借兵来，按说是我应该借给您，至于您许给我大齐的江山呢？小王我不敢想。不过话说回来，我与他们无冤无仇，又何况这无盐娘娘据说了不起呀。她一个人退几十万大兵啊，湘江会日锁五龙，赋响藕丝琴，都是人家干的，露脸的事太多了。这个事……你看看你要是到宋国和鲁国去问问可不可以呀？据说他们两家还沾亲戚，想当初娘娘彩凤山，立牌招亲，啊？鲁灵王、梁真王，他们上那去过，求过亲。我估计这关系还不错。”“啊，这个大王，您说这个我知道，他们两国是去了，让人给打回去了。打的惨着哪。”“是呀，你这么去借兵不是挺好吗？”“诶呀，大王千岁，我为什么找到楚国呀？关键是血葫芦僧，大法师算出来的。日后啊，齐国的江山有您的一份，而且来说，这一仗是准保成功。大师傅，您跟大王说说吧。”“弥陀佛！”和尚站起来了，楚成王一瞧：“嗯，这和尚有样。”站在这是一团的威风啊。“大师傅，您能算吗？”“哈哈哈哈哈哈，贫僧我通天彻地，能文能武啊。我掐指一算啊，齐国的疆土大部分是您的。齐国的社稷也是您的，日后您驾崩了，也要埋在齐国的土地上！”吴起站起来：“诶？这词一样啊～～你说我也这么说的。”“你甭管了你甭管了，我是神仙你知道吗？大王千岁，这一仗是准能赢啊。”楚王一琢磨：“要是赢那可不错。”楚国地方比较小，全国搁到一块，从这头走到那头三十分钟。总想扩充疆土，要是这么说，我把全国的军队调集到一起，啊？让这些个大将们跟着一块去打仗去。“您有十成十的把握能胜吗？”“弥陀佛！！没问题呀。有我血葫芦在，你就看热闹吧。
”楚王点点头：“好，寡人我就信你们一次，发全国的人马攻打大齐！寡人我要看看热闹。到底有多热闹啊？”血葫芦点点头：“要多热闹有多热闹。”“好，寡人我信你们，祝你们成功。诶？大师呀，你给寡人算一算，为什么寡人这个右眼直跳呀？嗯？”“您甭信那个！那都算人，你知道吗？来呀，吴郡马，咱们谢一谢大王千岁赐咱们兵马，此一去，两军阵前是人人奋勇，个个争先。一定要把大齐一举拿下！”说的挺好，校军场点兵，带领着楚国的人马，要杀奔大齐，临走的时候，楚国的大元帅黄大力跟大王说，说：“您哪，这个旨意传下来，我们做武将的要听，但是您啊，晚发兵一日，我要安排一下，有的兵马走了，有的兵马还要留下来护城保驾的，另外呢，微臣家中有些事，我得回去安排一下。”楚王点点头：“你去吧。”黄元帅回到自己的家，这个元帅呀，四十来岁，大个，而且双膀一晃无穷的力气。黄大力。回到家来，一进门，正瞧见自己这公子，黄小力，由打对面过来了，小伙子长得漂亮，一张小脸蛋，蓝汪汪的，翠蓝翠蓝的，剑眉虎目，鼻直口阔，大耳朝伦，微微的有点橘红色的头发。顶盔掼甲是罩袍束带。由打对面走过来了：“孩儿参见爹爹！”“罢了！哈哈哈哈哈哈，儿啊，越发的英姿飒爽了，啊？此一番，两军阵前，为父带着你见一见世面，做我的马前先锋，去吧～到后堂见一见你的母亲，咱们父子，要出征了。”“是！”孩子往后堂就走，来到后堂一瞧啊，自己的母亲跟这正摆弄花呢。黄大力的夫人呢就喜欢花，什么都不爱，一天到晚的什么墨菊呀，牡丹呀，各种的花，都是全国各地挑来的，稀有的种子，呵，一盆一盆摆弄的特别好，平时也不爱说话，除了和儿子有话说，这回正浇花呢，儿子打外边进来了：“娘啊。”放下浇花这碗一回头：“呦，儿啊，今天出去练了吗？”“我这不刚回来吗？我跟您说点事，现如今呢，咱们和齐国准备交锋了，我爸爸带着我两军阵前让我做个先锋官。我跟您说一声，我们明儿个就走了。”“啊？去打哪啊？”“去打大齐！听说大齐国有一位皇娘叫钟离无盐了不起，孩儿我现在满身的能耐，两军阵前不出三个回合我非把她杀了不可！”老太太上前跟身进步抡圆了啪！这大嘴巴打的，打的孩子转俩圈，一回头捂着脸：“打的是我呀？”给打懵了，这巴掌给打到三叉神经上了，再瞧这位黄夫人眼泪下来了，“孩儿啊，来来。”“不过去了，还打呀是怎么着？上瘾了？您这解恨不行啊，有什么事您说呀。”“跟我进屋来有话告诉你。”一伸手拉住自己的少爷，来到内室把门关好了，往这一坐夫人这眼泪可止不住了，这通哭啊。哭罢多时，擦了擦眼泪：“孩子，你知道娘为什么哭吗？”“那谁猜的着啊？啊？您哭了半天一句话都没说啊。到底因为什么啊？您是担心我还是担心我父亲？还是说不愿意打仗？”“孩子呀，一句话两句话可说不清楚，我就告诉你，两军阵前倘若说碰到了锺离国母，没有别的，不允许你伤害她一根头发，倘若说你掉了她一根头发，你回来为娘我就死。”“诶，娘啊，这是因为什么？”“你甭管了，这些个话现如今是说不清楚了，你记住这句话就行了，不需你伤害锺离国母！”“是！我听您的！”这孩子从小就听话，跟这辞别了母亲出来，随着自己的父亲是赶奔大齐。大队人马一出征啊，那可了不得啊，您想啊，人上一万是无边无沿。这抄起来是好几十万人马丫丫茬茬是乌杨乌杨的。大队人马在紧前边头一个就是这位血葫芦僧，旁边呢是郡马，这位吴起大将军。这边就是黄氏父子，骑在马上一个个精神十足啊，这意思一到了大齐两军阵前，交锋对垒，一下子就能把这钟离无盐那就能给杀了。一路上行走的时候，血葫芦僧啊，不住的打气：“你们啊放心，我是从三岁开始练，真正的童子功啊。啊？我没有不会的，什么刀、枪、剑、戟、斧、钺、钩、叉、镗、棍、槊、棒、鞭、锏、锤、抓、拐子、流星，什么带尖的、带刺的、带棱的、带刃的、带绒绳的、带锁链的、带倒齿钩带娥眉刺的，这些个我都练过！而且我是半仙之体啊，我一跺脚我就能飞起来，啊?一个跟头十万八千里，我还会七十二变……”说的挺热闹：“我什么都会，有我在你们放心吧，大齐国这次就算是完了。”说的简单这一天来到了临淄城以外，大兵压境，齐国早就得着消息了，娘娘一听说怎么着？有人来罚齐了？谁呀？一扫听：吴起！楚国借兵，把娘娘气得：忘恩负义，无耻的小人!他来了饶不了他！“来呀！抬过我的刀来！备过我的撼海麒麟！”娘娘整盔掼甲正身的披挂，“也不用多，带上我儿东鲁王薛昆，点精兵一千，随哀家我出城迎敌！”开开城门放下吊桥，人可就出来了，来到这把人排好了一瞧对过，丫丫茬茬这队伍看不见边。影影绰绰看队伍前边站着一大和尚，呲牙咧嘴，娘娘坐在憾海麒麟上一拽这缰绳，把这刀一抖棱，哗楞楞！！刀上有金环，金环碰金环，环环入耳，打到耳朵里边嗡～～～～坐到撼海麒麟上拿手一指：“呔！楚国兵将你们马前受死！！！”楚国的兵将是面面相观哪，都看着血葫芦僧，心说：“到地儿了，您给我们打气打了一道儿了。终于两军对垒了。”黄元帅坐在马上一拱手：“高僧，大师傅，您看怎么办呢？”“哈哈哈哈哈哈，休得担惊少要害怕，二等不必惊慌，涨他人的志气灭自己的威风。不就是一个丑鬼吗？有什么可怕的？来，听某将领：先退兵！
兵退二百里。”元帅纳闷啊：“这是什么道理呢？”“你听我的没错。先退二百里我缓缓再说……”一挥手，哗～前队改后队，人人扭过脸去，大队人马往下就败，娘娘坐在憾海麒麟上吓了一跳：“呀？打仗打多了，都是两军阵前你看我我看你晤一下子往上来呀，他们怎么晤一下往后去了？错了？找错道儿了？不是打大齐，打别的国家。”又一琢磨不可能，这楚国人是吃饱了撑的这是？探马蓝旗报得没错呀，啊？明明是吴起借兵他们倒反大齐。怎么会不打了呢？“不行，我得追上前问问。拿这个刀攥啊，在这个撼海麒麟跨上啪！打了这么一下，撼海麒麟知道这是主人告诉自己：快点跑，往前是连蹿带蹦，跟飞似的，楚国的兵将跑着跑着一回头：“诶呀！追来了！！”哗!!!跑得这快呀，来的时候都没这么快。回去这快呀，前队改后队，那么最后一个兵呢就改成头一排的了，那么来的时候头一排呢是血葫芦僧，他改了最后一排了。他想往前来也不那么易，头里好几万人呢你就说把大伙不拉开了也得有会功夫，而且这一乱顾不过来了。脚底下这一乱，有摔倒的有马腿折了的，乱做一团。娘娘催麒麟到了切近，一伸手，嘭！就把血葫芦僧后脖梗子这僧袍抓住了。葫芦僧一回头：“弥陀受不了的佛！”娘娘心说：“我听说了，就是你，血葫芦僧，怂恿吴起借兵，啊？兵罚大齐，你好不了！”娘娘那脾气您知道，轮圆这胳膊，胳膊也长——啪！！！就这大巴掌打的，俩眼当时就封上了。紧跟着这血哗就下来了，往下一扔他：“滚！”娘娘站在原地不动，看着楚国的兵将纷纷后退，血葫芦在地上缓了半天才站起来，擦了擦眼：都睁不开了，拿血把眼睛都迷住了。拿手一指娘娘：“后会有期！”迈腿就跑，娘娘坐在麒麟上叹口气：“唉，你图什么许的？这不是吃错了药了嘛？啊？”自己的兵丁也追上来把手中的兵刃一横：“别追了,由他们去！！”一转身，兜过撼海麒麟，大齐的兵丁转回临淄城。楚国的兵啊倒退了三百多里，扎住营盘，大伙得歇会啊，元帅也累坏了，心说这打仗图什么许的？一仗没打让人追出好几百里地去。歇会吧，翻身下马，马拴在柳树上，往这一坐，再瞧吴起，躺在地上，把身上的盔甲都解开了，跑热了，一通的喘。大伙歇够了：“大师呢？高僧哪去了？”有兵丁说：“我瞧见了，跑得时候回了一下头，那丑娘娘正打咱们大师呢。嘴巴子跟不要钱似的，打的挺惨。诶？回来了。”再瞧远处哩了歪斜回来了，脸也肿了，脑袋上都是血，元帅点点头：“嗯，来者是血葫芦吗？” 
“弥陀佛！贫僧掐指一算……”“你闭嘴！倒霉倒你身上了！！你怎么回事啊？两军阵前还没打呢，你这闹着退兵，到底因为什么呀？我到现在我才明白，我是元帅干嘛听你的呀？嗯？”“不是，我这不是能掐会算吗？我一算，你看啊，咱们主动退兵，还让人家追成这样了，这要迎上去咱们早亡国了知道么？”“你要早明白这个你撺掇我们打仗干什么呀？！啊？！”“不是，你别着急，知道吗，兵不厌诈！”“炸死你都不多！！知道吗？！！”“不是，你别着急。我好歹也是神仙，给神仙留点面子……”“我啐你我告诉你吧啊！再提这个？行了行了行了，别废话了。先歇着吧。”密松林安营扎寨，跟这大伙缓着。你说带着兵出来，一仗没见大败而归，回国去见楚王也没法说，黄家爷儿俩唉声叹气，吴起是心里着急：这是借的兵啊，要是本国的兵怎么都好说，我借的兵啊：“我回去怎么跟人交待？我要是不辞而别可就坏了，我跟他们也做了仇了，这仗还得打。不光打，还必须要胜，不胜都不行。”低头无语琢磨自己的。血葫芦僧呢？这几天每天用心修炼，晚上不睡觉，每天晚上踏钢步走，冲着月亮：“哈～～呼～～哈～～呼～～”巡逻的兵丁瞧着他：“哼，没羞没臊的，哼。”他也不往心里去，一点事都没有。元帅过了五六天把他想起来了：“诶？那大师哪去了？我好几天没看见他了，别让他走了啊？他不能走，回国得带着他走啊～跟大王千岁怎么说啊这事～”兵说：“他不走，他往哪走？他一天你知道他吃多少饭？他从这走了就得饿死知道吗～您放心～”“行行行行。”等着吧，修养了十天左右，兵丁们也恢复元气了。这一天，帐篷里边，黄元帅哪，端着茶杯，正喝茶呢，一边喝茶一边琢磨这个事，吴起蹿腾自己打去，可是自己的意思呢？打算退兵回去：“我要是回去的话，我跟大王怎么说这个事……”正琢磨呢，端着茶杯，听着门口：“弥陀佛！！”元帅点点头：“忙着呢！别进来啊！！别进来啊！！”门帘起处，血葫芦把脑袋探进来了：“就占一会儿功夫……”“你要说你是神仙你信吗？”“商量商量商量……”“进来进来！！”“诶诶诶……辛苦几位……辛苦辛苦……”元帅瞧瞧他：“你有事啊？～”“诶，嘿，我掐指一算哪……”“出去出去！出去！！”“我还没说完呢……”“别废话！你再说这个你就出去！”“不是不是，咱们马上就要打胜仗了！”“唉，你这两天是没少吃东西啊，撑的你是胡说八道啊。啊？说说吧，怎么打胜仗啊？”这喝着茶，斜眼看着他，“哈，元帅，临淄城指日可破！而且大齐国全国的君臣一个也留不下！让他们全死！！”“是啊？～好～祝你成功～”“不是，元帅，您别这样，您得鼓励鼓励我……我言出必行，我准让他们都死……”“啊，看吧，啊……”“元帅，你也别这样，我知道你恨我，头一仗是我没琢磨透，这回准赢。
我想一办法，我是神仙哪，半夜里我驾着云彩我夜入临淄城，我想一主意，我给他们下毒！无论是河，无论是井，无论是溪，只要沾水，我一做法，全是毒，他们一喝这毒水是必死无疑！！临淄城连一个耗子都剩不下，全得死！”“诶，你怎么能担保你这法术能灵呢？”“我试验过！”“你在哪试验过？”“咱的营盘！”“噗！！！！！！捆上他！！！捆上他！！！！！”黄小立过来抹肩头拢二臂捆住了：“你别走啊！！你别走！！我觉得有点肚子疼。你终於说一回实话，啊？有解药吗？”“不不，我没在您这喝的水里，我在兵丁喝的那水里……”“这不缺了德了吗？！咱们的兵丁怎么办？”“咱们这药轻，药轻，哈，缓个十天八天就成了，啊～没事，他们这一灵了呢，我马上夜入临淄城……”“你今天夜里就去！成与不成都是好事！！！知道吗？啊？”“不是元帅，您这是什么意思……”“什么意思？你要成了咱们就得胜而归，你要不成，你死他们那我也痛快痛快知道吗？啊？老血，准备准备去吧，啊？”“弥陀……”“出去出去，出去！！！”神仙也分三六九等，这个神仙就属于心宽的，换二一个人，换我，我就受不了这个，啊，这神仙没事，由打这出来，晚上饱餐栈饭，为什么呀？晚上有重大的体力活动。呵，高僧这通吃啊，甩开腮帮子，撩起后槽牙，饭菜象长江流水似风卷残云，里边小仓库打开了，钥匙拧开了就跟倒土箱子里似的，哐哐哐哐，兵丁们看着：“嗯，好，饱死鬼这是。好，吃吧。”都吃完了，按时间说，夜里边十二点，和尚站起来，紧了紧身上的衣服，袖口、裤腿都弄好了，冲着跟前的几个兵丁挥了挥手：“贫僧要去啦。”“嗯，好，去吧去吧，明年，明年今天我们给您烧香……祝您成功。”和尚一跺脚，腾！脚底下一团黑云，呜～～当时就起来了，兵丁们喊他：“大师！！下来！！这是帐篷！！！下来！！外边！！外边！！外边飞去！！”“哦？是啊？这个贫僧倒是喇合了。”撩僧袍出来，一跺脚，腾！！一团黑云把他托起来，是直奔临淄城方向是呜～～～下去了。小兵们鼓掌：“太好了，啊？你看看人家还会飞。你瞧见没？一直往前走，奔临淄城去了，看着吧,看他今天晚上作法施毒怎么样。”半悬空，这位大法师：血葫芦踩着云彩，拿眼瞧着，远处灯光明亮，那就是临淄城：“快到了，今天这一仗我是一定要成功啊！啊？你们谁也想不到今天晚上我一做法，你们全城的军民就算是完了。”高兴，眼前就到了临淄勒了，这就是城了，按落云头呜～～～～～磅！！！撞到城墙上了，啪！！摔下来了，把神仙摔得够呛，缓了有半小时站起来：“呵，高度计算错了。”“诶呀，到了啊，这就是临淄城。”跟前就是护城河，这先试试吧，一伸手——哗～～顺着掌心往外冒黑气，整个护城河的水马上就变颜色。自个儿乐：“哼！太灵了！哼哼！”高兴，正弄着呢，城头上有兵丁喊：“口令！！”怎么呢？瞧底下有人，看看是不是自己人：“口令！”和尚多灵啊：“齐宣王万岁！”“自己人！嗯,自己人。”这条河挺宽挺深，得弄半天，弄了俩多小时，和尚涮涮手：“诶呀，明天一喝这水这就算是行啦。诶，城里我也得去。”城里边有水井，尤其皇宫里边的，他不喝外边的，“对！”赶紧念咒，脚底下一团黑云托起来——呜～～越过城墙，来到了临淄城皇宫以内，左右瞧了瞧，这有一口八宝琉璃井，和尚来到且近，掐诀念咒一伸手——唰～～～顺着掌心往外喷黑气，唰～～～过来几个巡夜的御林军：“口令！！”“哈，娘娘最漂亮！！”“嗯？好自己人！”唰，打这院出来，这院还有哪，唰～～～二十多口水井全都喷上毒了。尤其御膳房这，有一口井，这是御用的井，齐宣王喝这个，更得弄啊，拿手一伸唰～～～毒气直奔井口去了，又过来几个兵丁：“口令！”“啊，娘娘最漂亮！！今年二十，明年十八！”“抓他！！娘娘说了，改十七！！”全围上来了，和尚一跺脚，脚驾黑云，跑回去了。来到了自己营盘，按落云头，大踏步的往回走，是趾高气扬啊：“这一次可了不得了，我一个人把大齐国平了！”小兵看他都愣：“呀？又回来了？真回来啦。大师？”“禀告元帅，我回来了，今天晚上我这法术成功了，明天听好信儿，赶紧禀报元帅，我要跟他说这个事。”“好咧！！”小兵来到后边，跟这个元帅黄大力一说这事，黄元帅啊，都睡了：“什么事啊？”“跟您说啊，元帅，法师回来了，说这个临淄城啊，都散满毒气了，明天大齐就灭了，他这会儿相见您跟您聊回儿……”“告诉他今儿睡觉了，啊？有事明儿在说吧，啊。真成了再说。”“诶，好勒。”转身出来：“嗯，大帅睡了，您也歇着吧，有事明儿在说。”“好！明天你们听着，让你们一个个啊，不敢轻视我！！”

伤情最是晚凉天，憔悴斯人不堪怜。邀酒催肠三杯醉，寻香惊梦五更寒。钗头凤斜卿有泪，徒迷花了我无缘。小楼寂寞心与月，也难如钩也难圆。! 
感谢朋友们的光临。今天晚上呢，给大伙儿说一段长篇的单口相声，叫“白宗巍坠楼”。这个事情呢，是想当初发生在天津的一段真人真事儿，我们的相声大师张寿臣先生把这个事情丰富之后，整理成为长篇的单口相声，但是呢，很少有演员哪来说它，为什么呢？时间占得挺长，而且里边呢，这个头绪挺复杂，一环套一环，所以很长时间来呀没有人说这个节目。我们呢，也怕它失传了，所以尽量的呢，想把这类的作品，能够更多地呈现在舞台上，多多地保留一些这些传统的节目。
这个长篇单口相声啊，跟评书有接近的地方。第一，篇幅比较长。有的时候啊，每天说这么一段儿，能说半个月一个月，在这一点上跟评书是一样的。区别在哪呢？可能喜剧的因素稍微多一点儿，啊，注重包袱，注重笑料。除此之外，两者差不多。评书，大家很熟悉，全国哪儿都有。一般来说呢，都是用普通话说的，但是各地也有这些个方言评书。比如说，到了山东，有山东评书。有位名家，刘彦广刘先生，山东评书的名家，说《燕子李三》说得好。说话呢，全都是山东方言（倒口）：“这燕子李三垫步拧腰噌上了房了”。山东话。四川有四川评书，啊，四川评书有意思，这个醒目的使用率稍微高一点，我听过，啊，你看我们这个很少拍，开始时候派，快结束了拍。四川评书在节目当中也经常用（倒口）“话说（拍一下醒目），刘备（拍一下醒目），关羽（拍一下醒目），张飞（拍一下醒目），赵云（拍一下醒目）”，跟烙烧饼的在一块儿上班儿。所以他们这个醒目的使用率非常的高。风格不一样但目的都是一样的，讲古比今，劝人向善，教人学好，不敢说是“高台教化”，但教人学好这是真的，没有说听完这个出去弄把刀劫道的，没有。
咱们这个事情发生在什么时候呢？1927年10月12号，上午十点，有人说你这是胡说八道，评书一般来说没有这么准确。哎，这个是我们查过资料，查过档案，时间是没错的。就在这个时间，天津市旭街，就是现在的和平路上，有一个很大的建筑，叫中原公司，现在就是天津的百货大楼。那阵儿，这可是了不起的地方，人来人往，买什么的都有。中原公司的楼顶上边儿，尽上边这一层是屋顶花园，摆着一圈啊各种的盆花儿，这大盆儿，好几十斤，栽着各种的花儿，摆了一圈儿。靠墙这儿呢，有一个露天的电影的银幕，底下摆着一些个茶座。逛商场逛累了呢，跟这儿坐一会儿，要杯汽水啊，吃块儿点心啊，看看露天电影啊，休闲解闷。就在这些个看露天电影的人里边，有这么一位，三十四五岁的年纪，穿着一件大褂儿，浅灰色的长衫，看这人这气质啊，是个念书人，可瞧着呀，好像受什么刺激了，这俩眼没神，凝（NING4）了，这头发还挺乱，脸上还有伤，看这意思让人打了。这主儿跟这儿坐着将近三个小时了，也不说话，到最后，喊过伙计来，要过纸笔墨砚，刷刷点点，写了几行字儿。写好了，叠上，塞在怀里，从自己的座位上站起来，往边儿上走，手扶着这个凉台往下看，底下就是天津旭街，人来人往。瞧着瞧着，这主儿一撩大褂儿，踩着椅子，就上了这沿儿了。周围人都没留神，没人注意，他噌一下子，都没带打錛的，大头冲下，呜----，人就跳下去了。临下去时候啊，这个右腿无意中挂掉了一盆花。连人再花，呜---全下去了。大头冲下，拿脑袋找这地面，啪-----当时就碎了，脑浆子全出来了，目击者里边好多人打这儿起就不喝豆腐脑儿了。人就死了。
由打对面，中原公司对面，有一个香港药房，药房里边一推门啊，刚才出来一个人，看这年纪五十左右，穿着西装，打着领带，拄着文明棍儿，戴着巴拿马的草帽，金丝眼镜儿，看着很有钱。这个人姓李，叫李德生，现在，香港药房的经理是他。前些日子还不是他了。怎么呢？这买卖儿是他哥哥的，他哥哥叫李德兴，香港药房的经理，发财了。怎么呢？这主儿啊研制出一种药来，叫“万灵王”。不管你得什么病，说我这药水灌下去，你就能好。“万灵王”。真这么灵吗？胡说八道，就是水里边搁了一些个安眠的药剂，对外声称，我这个啊什么都治。最拿手的治中风，不管你什么样儿，左边儿弹，右边儿弹，俩手一块儿弹，啊，一捏嘴灌一瓶下去，就这么小瓶，一百块钱一瓶，灌下去就好。真有灵的，怎么呢？多灌几瓶啊，人就睡觉了，就不闹了。因为这个，发了财了。有一天晚上自个跟屋算账，我卖这个卖得，啊，还了得？这个配方就我知道，谁也不知道，家里亲属都没告诉，啊，我得算算，我挣了多少钱了，算来算去，嚯，不敢说富可敌国吧，最起码来说，我这财富顶得上大半个天津市。一高兴，中风了，哎呀，弹起来看了。家里人纳闷，呦，怎么了这是？不要紧的，没事儿，咱们家是卖这个万灵药水的，给他灌吧，一捏嘴往里灌。他自己知道是攥人哪，直钸冷脑袋，家里人一琢磨，哦，他嫌这药量小，把大瓶的拿来。有十斤一瓶的，咚咚咚咚咚咚咚，灌下去当时就没事了，也不抽了也不闹了也不弹了，死了。死了之后，这生意由他的弟弟李德生接管，刚当经理第三天，今天准备出去拜访一下原来这些客户，穿得干干净净的，拄着文明棍儿，往门口一站，等洋车呢。刚站好，洋车没来，由打上边，呜----啪-----摔下一个来，就在眼面前儿，脑浆迸裂，万朵桃花开。李德生有严重的心脏病，看了一眼，咣，躺下，心脏病发作，死了。摔死一个，吓死一个。
还下来一花盆呢。这大花盆，好几十斤呢，还有好几十斤土呢，还有花呢。啊，打上边下来这个快呀，这速度啊，140来迈，下来了。万幸啊，没砸着多少人。由打大街的南边儿，来了一辆洋车，拉洋车这主儿啊低着头，坐洋车这主儿啊翘着腿，仰着脸儿。坐车这主儿啊，姓杨叫杨金雀。天津卫有名的大骗子，到上海这种人叫“拆白党”，专门骗人。今天，挣了钱了，怎么呢？他前些日子啊，认识这么一朋友，这主儿姓贾叫贾长生。哥俩不错，也是生意上的伙伴。聊来聊去，他觉着哎这姓贾的值得来一刀，扭回头来，从南市“华乐埠” ，“华乐埠”就是天津的妓院，找了两个妓女，一个叫金花，一个叫文玉，把这俩找来了。他自己跟里边做套儿，安排时间，让这金花跟这贾先生一块儿吃顿饭，贾先生一瞧，哎呀，嗬，太漂亮了，啊，这是哪儿的？哦，这是，这是我的朋友。哦，好。太好看了，啊。长这脸跟苹果似的，那嘴跟樱桃似的，腮帮子跟梨似的，眼睛跟葡萄似的，这女的长一水果的脑袋。就跟这杨金雀商量，我能不能娶她？没问题。三说五说，就搬到一块住去了，而且来的时候是俩人，怎么呢？还有一个叫文玉的呢。说这是谁？啊，这是你小姨子。仨人就一块儿过吧。过了一段时间，早先这贾先生身体挺壮，啊，宽肩膀儿，四方大脸的，过了仨月这人跟羊蝎子似的，说话都没劲儿，浑身没力气。不要紧的，这俩妓女给出主意，你得补，啊，拿红糖啊，腌这人参让他吃，吃吧，大象都受不了啊。
在结婚的时候，就这位杨金雀给贾先生投了份儿保，啊，那阵说一千块钱保四十年的寿，如果说没到四十年死了，给十万块钱。他是成心往死道儿上挤兑他。一直到这一天一瞧说这人完了，啊，连咳嗽都没劲儿了。打电话，保险公司来人了。您瞧瞧，这俩妓女会说呀，你看我丈夫，这些日子每天上班做生意，劳累过度，你看现在这身体。啊没事儿没事儿，保险公司说不要紧的，真出事儿了我们负责。我看看，我看看，我还会点中医，我给贾先生号号脉，不要紧的，这个脉很平和嘛，啊，脉分七表八里，啊，不要紧的，我看我懂，没事儿，我跟您说，慢说没事，就算现在死了，我们赔，呀？没脉了，死了。仨人跟这儿哇哇哭，怎么仨人呢？是啊，金花、文玉，还有保险公司这个。一个哭丈夫的，一个哭姐夫的，一个哭钱的。仨人跟这儿哭。打发人把死尸弄走，今天把钱给了这杨金雀了。这小子高兴啊，发了财了，啊，带着钱，叫了辆洋车，准备出去玩去，正走在这儿，他仰着脸儿，翘着二郎腿，哼哼唧唧的，“俺们那嘎达都是东北人”，那阵儿也没这歌儿可能，正高兴呢。由打上边，这大花盆下来了，砰！整砸脸上。您想啊，他仰着身儿这么坐，“咵”砸上，整个人就翻过去了，啪一下子，脑袋就碎了。拉洋车这主儿呢，正低着头呢。要不怎么有这么句话呢？“得意莫仰首，失意莫低头”，就说他们俩人。说你得意时候你别撇着大嘴的，这容易拿花盆儿砸着。“失意莫低头”，失意说这会我不顺，不顺你也正常一点，你不能天天这样怎么弄啊这玩意儿啊，这不行。拉车这主儿，姓田叫田二，这小子本身哪，家里有点钱，富家子弟，不学好，吃喝嫖赌抽，坑蒙拐骗偷，最后没辙了拉洋车。前两天，走了一步贼运，怎么呢？捡了一张彩票，也不知谁扔那儿的，跟街上他捡起来一瞧，对对号儿吧，中奖了，十万块，多少钱啊，高兴，一高兴，他这心脏也不太好，跟街上就躺下了，给送到医院去。啊，求这大夫，你一定把我救好。我现在是有钱人了，我刚有钱我舍不得死，我称十万，你把我救活了，我给你五万。说得挺好，这大夫心脏不太好。你给我五万？哎呀，咣，死这儿了。一句话把大夫美死了。大夫家里不干，打官司吧，烦人拖翘的，最后田二家里把这五万也给人家了，那五万算罚款。还得出来拉车来，越琢磨越别扭，每天出来还低头，拉着车也低头，心说还有没有奖券了？这一低头不要紧，今儿把命低了。怎么呢？车上坐这主儿啊翻过去了，他是无意中，没有想到，这车把没抓住，整个连人带车也翻起来了，按拉洋车的术语来说，这叫“打天秤”，整个翻过去了。田二，日------ 脑袋冲下，奔马路牙子去了，马路牙子是石头的，拿脑袋和石头做了一个轻微的较量，田二输了。当时这就碎了，死这儿了。  C9 ?! o; j& }" u6 x: A/ I.

一个人跳楼摔死了，心脏病吓死一个，大花盆儿砸死一个，脑袋跟那儿较量还死了一个。这个单口相声刚开始说，没超过十分钟，死了四个人，这是何其壮观的事情？整个这街上过不去人了，怎么呢？太残酷了。啊，一眨眼的功夫，四个人都躺下了。中国人有一个很好的优点，好看热闹，嚯，大伙儿都兴奋哪，太好了！今儿出来出来对了，啊，往常撑死死一个俩就了不得了，今天你瞧，死四个，这多得看哪这个！来咱们看看这个，一会儿再看那个。大伙儿跟这儿参观。有警察，不是没警察。一吹这哨儿，嘟-----，全出来了，啊别动别动别动，围住了，保护现场。翻吧，翻死尸身上有什么呀，啊，有的东西可以作为呈堂证供，有的东西呢，警察也得贴补家用。啊，这个我的这是。翻，翻来翻去，在跳楼的这个人身上发现了这张纸，拿起来打开了，写着几行字。要念还没念呢，由打后边过来一位。哎，胖子。哟，这警察一回头吓一跳，哎哟嗬，彭检察官。他认识。这个人哪，四十岁左右的年纪，中流个，黄白镜子，长得挺精神，穿着一身西装，这儿别着一杆笔。天津高等检察厅一等检察官，彭斌。哎，胖子。他认识这警察，其实这警察也不是特别胖，才300来斤，三身儿警服改完了他一人儿穿。哎，彭检察官。这是什么呀？这是死尸身上搜出来的，您瞧瞧吧。好，彭斌接过来一瞧啊，上边写着几行字：“宗巍提笔泪不干，信呈当地检察官。贪赃卖法不公断，后辈儿孙我一般。白宗巍绝笔。”明白了，死的这主儿姓白，叫白宗巍，写上绝笔俩字儿，说明是有备而来，只有这种书信上才写绝笔呢，借条上没有这个。“今借现金四十万，徐德亮绝笔”。可别借给他啊，就没打算还。
马瘦毛长蹄子肥，

  儿子偷爹不算贼，

  瞎大爷娶个瞎大奶奶，

  老两口过了多半辈儿，

  谁也没看见谁!

  给大伙儿说一段儿单口相声，叫范家店。说相声说评书都是一个意思，不敢说高台教化，但起码说教人学好。而且我们很多节目都是来源于民间，从民间而来。有的呢，还是真事儿。

  啊……你像今天这事儿，离着这个门口就不远。发生在北京天桥儿，拐过弯儿去，现如今有的地儿已经拆了，啊，过去有一大片居民区。都是大杂院儿，世世代代居住着北京城这些个普通的百姓。

  有这么一个大杂院儿啊，院子里边住着一家姓李的人家。就两口人，两口子，啊，男的姓李叫李鸣斋。什么工作呢，勤行。啊就是饭店里跑堂的。

  过去来说，饭馆儿里跑堂的不简单。不像现在似的，啊，有的时候这个服务员，工作上也好方方面面也好没有规矩或者不到位。过去不行，一进饭馆儿学徒，从剥葱剥蒜开始，学到独挡一面的跑堂的得二十年。

  啊，这里面学文深了。见什么人说什么话，看眼色。呵!得有眼力见儿，脑子反映得快，嘴得跟得上!啊，这儿客人吃饭，吃出一苍蝇来。“伙计，过来!这是什么?” “啊，这…苍蝇。哈，这…绿豆蝇。这…看着我就恶心。呕……(呕吐声音)”

  马上，走，这就不能用了。有这聪明的，“嗨，过来!这什么?”不等你说，拿筷子一夹(网嘴里扔状)“花椒炸糊了…”就这个玩意儿啊。能说掌柜的不喜欢么?就喜欢这样的伙计。

  而且过去来说，这跑堂的好坏，关系到你的生意如何。过去北京有的大饭店，对这伙计就跟演戏似的。怎么呢，这儿吃着饭呢，客人不满意，“呵这个跑堂的啊，这不是东西。”

  嗯，这儿一闹，紧跟着一会儿功夫儿掌柜的来了，“对不起，我们这伙计惹您生气了，哈，我们这就赶他走。”一撩帘儿你瞧吧，这伙计扛着铺盖卷儿打你门口过去了。你心里痛快啊，“呵!我这儿刚说一句这开除了!”痛快吧，一会儿上汤还是他。你也知道是假的你痛快呀，他让你过得去呀。要不怎么说熬一大跑堂的不容易。

  咱们说这李鸣斋就是一大跑堂的。啊，掌柜的拿他当成左右手。平时也忙，也回不去家。顶个六七天，回趟家，啊住一两天。哎，这些日子，赶上六月份。饭馆儿里边儿呢，修理炉灶。

哈到日子了，这灶啊头天凉之前全规制一次。大伙儿有功夫儿了，啊全回趟家。过去做生意讲究这个，尤其是把这灶修理的这之前，给顾客们，给东西量也大，都给好的。为了是什么呢，我们修完了，您还回来吃。

  过去东来顺就这样儿。东来顺儿每年到天儿热也是修理炉灶。修炉灶之前你上那吃吧，你要要要羊肉，多给一倍。啊，楼底下散座儿，馅儿饼，包子，个儿都大，给的肉也多，吃完你总惦着。

  过两天去人家关门儿了，修理炉灶。你上别处儿吃去吧，哪儿肉片儿也给不了这么些个，哪儿的包子也没这个儿大。啊，别处包子一两仨，人家这个半斤一个，他收一两的钱。你总得念他好。他那一开门儿，大伙儿呼啦全来了。为什么人家生意干得好，这是买卖道儿，生意经。

  这两天，李鸣斋所在的同福楼修灶。“啊你们都回去歇着吧，啊，回家住些日子。”哎李鸣斋就回来了。一进门儿呢，媳妇儿挺高兴。啊这大奶奶乐了

  “呵!可回来了。哈!这些日子那个挺忙的你们那儿?”

  “啊可不么，这些日子，哎呀累坏了我了，掌柜的也不让去，知道么，好些个活儿都指着我了!”

  “那行了，你赶紧歇着吧。我去打点儿酒，啊买点儿肉，晚上咱两口子喝会儿子。”

 

  大奶奶站起身来往外走，他这儿喊

  “哎!那什么给我拿两身儿替换衣裳，我擦巴擦巴洗巴洗巴，换换衣服。”

  “你这个三十来岁奔四十的人了，啊，都跟那个柜子那儿呢，你自个儿拿呀，啊自个儿自个儿找。”

  大奶奶出去了，他自己也乐，“你瞧这事儿闹的…”找吧，一翻柜子，啊找衣服。拿手往下一摸，箱子底儿有东西。摸着挺长，圆的，挺硬棒。“什么呀?”拿出来了，那么两个长纸卷儿。打开一瞧，现大洋。

  大约一看呐，有二百块钱。这是多少钱呐，啊，普通的人一辈子都挣不出来啊。心里咯噔一下子“坏了!我常年累月的不在家，莫非说我媳妇儿找了野汉子了?”自己照着镜子，这色儿没变呐……心里不痛快啊，啊，心里不痛快啊。“我跟外边儿苦熬苦掖，你跟家里你…这不行啊这个!”心里就别扭。

  一会儿的功夫儿，大奶奶回来了，打的酒，买的肉，买的菜弄一大堆搁这儿了。

  “来吧，一会儿咱们喝会儿子吧。”

  “唉~喝不喝的到不着急，我问你点儿事儿吧。”

“哎?你怎么了?这刚回来跟我掉脸子?你因为什么呀?”

  “这是什么呀?”把钱摔这儿了。大奶奶一瞧乐了“哈哈哈哈哈哈哈~~哦~你因为这个生气?…”

  “啊!怎么回事儿啊?”

  “你不是总不回来么…”

  “啊!那你就那样啦?”

  “别喊让街坊听见…”

  “啊你也知道丢人呐?!”

  “我挣的…”

  “给这么些个啊?!”

 

  大奶奶挺生气。

  “你怎么这样儿啊你啊?讨厌!是我挣的!怎么着吧!”

  “呵!好!好!你要这样儿的话这家没法儿呆了!我走!”

  摔门出去了。大奶奶也没拦着。

 

  两口子呀，有的时候就是这个。好多事儿啊，容不得说清楚。其实这钱怎么回事儿呢，还真是大奶奶挣的。怎么挣的呀?大奶奶他父亲是个老中医，啊，教过姑娘，教过什么，教过针灸。

  拿银针呐扎穴位治病。街坊邻居谁家有什么事儿找来呢，还是准管。嗯，而且来说不敢说治一个好一个吧，最起码儿来说，哎，也是十个里边儿有七八个见轻的，都传开了。

  就是前两天的事儿。 大奶奶跟屋里边儿啊这儿正做活呢哈，针大点儿啊……正做活儿呢，啪啪啪，有人一打门。赶紧开开门“您谁啊?”一瞧站着俩人儿，穿着打扮儿挺整齐，还都穿的一样，像是大户人家的手下人。

  “啊问一下儿，您是李太太么?”

  “啊是，我们当家的姓李。您什么事儿啊?”

  “嗯…听说您医术高明，我们小姐病了，好些个大夫治不好，说您这针灸能治，您能给帮个忙么?”

  “啊这没事儿不要紧的，医术高明谈不到，能凑活看，哈，要是好了呢更好，不好您别怪我。”

  “呦，那这么着，我们给搭进来吧…”

  “等会儿，别搭进来。”

  心说，自个儿家，啊房子也窄，屋里也不干净，人家这一听说，大宅门儿小姐，人闲脏。我出来吧，把做活儿这针在火山烤了一烤烧了一烧，把它擦干净了，这算消毒。

  跟着俩人出来一瞧外边儿一汽车。家里有钱，打开车门儿，小姐跟后座儿上呢，一瞧就知道没事儿，怎么呢，中暑。两针下去，小姐坐起来了，啊，这是药到病除啊，好了。

呵!高兴啊。 “谢谢您谢谢您…”千恩万谢。大奶奶没往心里去，因为什么，这事儿很多。跟人客气客气走了，自己回家了。赶等到头天黑，这俩人又回来了。提了一盒儿点心。

  “哈我们老太爷说了，谢谢您哈。”

  “哎呀这个买东西，花钱…”

  “不不您，您留着吧。”

  搁的屋里边儿了。临走说“您，您可自己吃啊，您，您打开瞧瞧。”俩人走了“不，这不合适啊!”再瞧人家走了。打开点心盒儿一瞧，就这二百块现大洋。拿纸卷好了。“哎呦!这么些钱呐!这可不行!我得给人送回去!”拎着盒子再出来车都没影儿了。再问，不知道，谁家的，不知道。得了，先搁着吧。对机会再说吧。把这二百块现大洋就搁的箱子底下了。

  今儿个李鸣斋回来没问清楚，就翻饬了。他走了，大奶奶还委屈呢，“这缺德的你看看啊，我这给人扎一针挣你说了二百块钱，你怀疑我，走走走，活该，啊。”心说，抬杠拌嘴三五天你就得回来吧，好，一个多月没露面儿。

  眼瞅着八月十五了，大奶奶慌了，“嘶这可不行，啊，往常也有矫情的时候，这回闹的时间太长了，我得去!”来到饭馆儿这儿一问

  “我是…啊找李鸣斋，那是我们当家的。”

  先生说

  “他走了呀，他那回…六月份了吧这得有啊，说回趟家，完事儿就回来跟掌柜的说…要结账，说不干了。掌柜的直央给他呀，啊干这么些年了老东老伙的，有什么别扭事儿您说，别不干呐。他说他太原有一舅舅，开大饭馆儿的。上那儿发财去。好朋友不挡财路，我们没话说。帐结清楚了，他走了奔太原了。”

  “哎呦，是啊…哦那谢谢您吧。”

  转身回来了。自个儿心里别扭，“唉!李鸣斋啊李鸣斋，男子汉大丈夫怎么做事儿这样儿啊!啊?!就因为一赌气你走啦?!你撇下我一个人这日子怎么过啊这个。太原，我找你去!”

  又一琢磨这挺难，妇道人家出门儿不方便呐，啊，怎么办呢?想了想有主意了，站的门口一瞧由打这边儿来一剃头的。挑一挑子，手里拿着唤头，唤头就是跟大铁镊子似的，啊拿着这个，拿着这个小铁棍儿，打这儿往外一弄，得儿棱得儿棱……现在很少啦过去这个很多。

“哦?呵嗯，来来啦”

  叫过来了，挺高兴。

  “您上屋里来吧。”

  “哎，好!大奶奶上屋儿剃去!”

 

  一说上屋里剃去，心里高兴，怎么呢，瞧这穿着打扮这岁数，这妇道人家，估计是让我给孩子剃胎头。小孩儿剃胎头有规矩，剃一个头给俩头的钱，今儿发财了，很高兴。挑挑儿进来了。来到屋里边儿，

  “行啦大奶奶，把小少爷抱出来吧。”

  “没有。没有。”

  “哦不是你们家孩子啊?给，给谁剃啊?”

  “给我。”

  “给你剃?我木(没)淆(学)过啊!我都是给老爷们儿剃啊!”

  “你给我剃。”

  “不是我这…我没淆(学)过啊我啊!”

  “我告儿你，你给我剃好了，我给你钱，给你一块现大洋，知道么。你要不剃的话我现在就喊，就说你强入民宅，强行无理…” “哎呀，那剃吧那就，啊，那咋儿剃啊?剃个啥呀?”

  “我来一背头吧。”

  “啊，好。”

  这儿开始给弄，弄的都挺好的，照镜子一瞧，还挺像男的。给了钱之后，攥着一块现大洋，这剃头的跟疯了似的，仍儿……往外就跑，三分钟又回来了，剃头挑子落这儿了啊。

  冲镜子左看右看呐自己这耳朵眼儿不像，怎么呢，过去这女人有耳朵眼儿，而且呢她这个嗯耳朵眼儿挺大，不像现在你说打一耳钉啊，啊有两天它张上了，那不成，眼儿挺大。

  这怎么办呢，把蜡烛点起来了，啊拿这蜡油啊揉这耳朵眼儿。揉差不多呢，把眼儿堵上了。拿粉呢又扑上点儿。哎你不细看你瞧不出来。拿了几件儿衣服有自己的有丈夫的装的包袱里，把这二百快钱带的身上，托付了一下自己的街坊，“你们给看点儿门，我出去一趟，如果我们当家的要是回来了告诉他别走跟家等着我。”

  大奶奶，上火车站，奔太原。那会儿正是兵荒马乱军阀混战的时候啊，铁路上也不太平。北京到太原，就这么点儿路程停停走走，走了有这么将近啊这么二十来天，才到太原。

  倒是以前听说过，啊，有个舅舅，在这儿开大饭店的，找吧，找来找去找到了。到这儿一问呐，说

  “这个…您来晚啦，早先确实有这么一饭店。他那舅舅啊，已经死了。现在这买卖家儿，倒给我们了。”

“不是，这个…俩月前来没来一个叫李鸣斋的?是他外甥啊。”

  “哦您说这有这么一人。哈，天儿还热着呢，来了这么一位。听说舅舅死了，转身他也走了。去哪儿我们不知道。”

 

  完了……大奶奶一听坏了，这上哪儿找去，坐车回去吧。啊，赶紧回北京。车也不顺，走走停停停停走走。这天，实在受不了了跟车上下来了。说这是哪儿，一问这地儿啊，长辛店儿。哎，这离着北京不远了。心说，我想想办法吧。

  这会儿天就已经凉下来了。树叶儿也都掉了。刮着风。把身上衣服啊，都系紧了，还挺饿。大奶奶远远儿一瞧啊，那有一小店儿。嗯，门口呢挂着一个小笊篱。啊这是嗯店的幌子。

  来到这儿一瞧呢，就一老太太。说

  “您这儿有吃的么?”

  “没有。哈，这个我们这个就一个人儿，儿子呢儿媳妇儿都不在，我自己也没心思弄。嗯就是您要住啊，还行。吃饭就没有。”

  大奶奶说

  “要这样儿的话…嗯您为什么不填上点儿吃食呢?”

  “嗨谁能弄啊?”

  “我行啊。”

  “哦你你能帮助我?”

  “啊哈，我身上也带着点儿钱。嗯现在也成一个人儿了，也不愿意回去了。您要不嫌弃呢，我认您当干妈。我留在这儿呢，咱娘俩儿 一块儿弄这小店儿，前面吃饭，后边儿住宿。您瞧怎么样啊?”

  老太太说

  “那敢情好，啊哈，我就吃碗安乐茶饭，前面我都不管了你看着弄吧!”

 

  老太太住的后边儿去了。前边儿呢雇几个人给刷一刷擦一擦，填上点儿碗筷，砌个锅，啊都弄好了。招了一伙计，啊叫侯德庆，挺老实，山东人。也会蒸包子，也会抻面，嗯眼边儿前儿的菜也能炒挺合适。

 

  “你愿意么?”

  “是，我愿意，我这回去也目(没)事儿干，我就跟这儿吧。”

 

  挺好。头天开业早上起来，蒸了两屉包子，弄了点儿菜都都切完了跟这儿，下开雪了。哎呀，漫天大雪啊。天与地都是白茫茫一片呐。没人来吃饭，没人来住宿。

  大奶奶呢，坐的柜台里边儿直冲盹儿。这伙计侯德庆呢，跟这儿待着抱着肩膀儿，冲外边儿看。“哎呀，目(没)有来吃饭地(的)，啊，再目(没)人来我就吃了。啊，这个包子我自己活的馅儿，啊我知道我这个手艺啊，我自己来一个吃吧。”

刚要伸手，由打远处，噔噔噔噔噔，来了一个人伸手就推门。谁呀，李鸣斋。没有这么巧的，对，无巧不成书。

  李鸣斋现如今混的挺落魄。找自己这舅舅死了，上别的饭馆儿吧人家不用人。身上没多少钱，啊这俩月过去之后呢，衣衫褴褛，头发都挺长，一脸的滋泥儿。而且这几天三天没吃饭了，瞧谁都像烙饼。啊，远远儿的瞧见这儿有一小饭店，心说就是它了，又一琢磨我是干勤行儿的呀，我知道没有钱人家不卖饭呐。

  跟街边儿上抓了一把石头子儿，揣的怀里边儿，鼓鼓囊囊。谁瞧见都像是铜子儿。啊，挺高兴。来到这儿一推门进来了。

  “有饭吃么?”

  “啊，有!哈刚蒸得了包子!啊快坐快坐!”

  让的这儿，“嗯~~您了吃熟(什)么呀?”

  “六屉包子，四锅面条儿，啊，五盆汤，来，来一百个馒头啊。”

  “哎呀，您了是吃饭啊你是自杀啊?死的方法儿多了啊，你干熟(什)么遭禁粮食啊?啊。”

  “我我我饿…”

  “我看出你恶(饿)哈，我瞧着你就不善我告儿你吧嗯。”

  拿了两盘儿包子给煮了碗面，又来了碗高汤。坐的这儿，好，李鸣斋可看见饭了。甩开腮帮子，撩开后槽牙，把里边儿套间儿打开了，小仓库的钥匙拧开，饭菜如长江流水似风卷残云，就跟倒土箱子里似的，七扯咔嚓七扯咔嚓……全吃了。

  啊，吃饱了往这儿一坐，一抹嘴儿，

 

  “伙计。”

  “霍，大爷，吃饱咧?结账是不?”

  “你算算，多少钱呐?”

  “哈这目(没)多少钱哈，啊一共这是~~一块二毛钱，哈，一块二毛钱。”

  “嗯。没钱。”

  “呀?啊这个了了了不起啊你啊，你吃的比谁都多，你这胆子比谁都大，目(没)钱你就敢吃饭呐啊!阴天下雨不知道，兜儿里有钱目(没)钱不知道么!啊，你骗人啊。你那个怀里边儿鼓鼓囊囊地(的)，啊，你别舍不地(的)蒙吃蒙喝不行啊。”

  “啊，你要这个?”

  掏出来，哗啦……侯德庆过去还看呢，

  “哦，看来是真目(没)钱，啊。这个石子儿像是门口儿马路上的那个哈。你目(没)钱呐?”

  “没钱。我跟您这么说，我是异乡之人，落魄至此没有别的，跟你们掌柜的说，啊哈，嗯可怜可怜我。我以后有了钱了再还了也行，或者给我记上账也行。”

“记账?俺们这儿也目(没)有账本儿啊。你等着吧，我几(给)掌柜的说说吧，啊。”

  转身找这大奶奶。他可不知道大奶奶是女的，一直拿他当掌柜的。大奶奶跟这儿坐着呢，

  “这个，掌柜的…” “什么事儿啊?” “来吃饭滴(的)了”

  “不给他端了么。”

  “他吃完了。”

  “算账啊。”

  “他目(没)钱啊。他吃了好些个东西啊。他吃完他目(没)钱。”

  “那怎么办呢?”

  “让让让我问您怎么办涅。你说怎么办涅?”

  “哦，你问他任打认罚吧。”

  “好，好主意，我问他去。”

  回来了。

  “哎，认打认罚呀?”

  “认打怎么说呀?”

  “…等着……掌柜的，认打怎么说呀?”

  “认打，衣裳扒光了，扔的院儿里，浑身上下泼上凉水，把他冻上。”

  “哎，这主意好嗯。”

  回来了

  “扒光了，扔院儿里，泼上水都冻成冰棍子。”

  “认打。认罚呢?”

  “你等着啊……掌柜的，认罚怎么办涅?”

  “认罚呀，认罚就留的咱们这儿当伙计，一个月开八块钱，先给他四块，马上洗澡换衣裳。”

  “嗯?啊这是罚他呀?”

  “行，去说去。”

  “哎!”

 

  转身回来了

  “掌柜的说啦，认罚的话呀留下当伙计，给八块钱，先支四块，洗澡，换衣裳，剃头。你愿意不?”

  “啊?我认罚…”

  “我奏(就)知道你得认罚呀!你准得认罚呀!我一个月才能挣三块啊我!你这八块钱支四块啊你这，你哪儿说理去这事儿闹的!”

  怎么回事儿啊，瞧出来是李鸣斋了。两口子过了好几十年了能不知道么。往那一坐一说话，大奶奶一瞧，“哎!好!好缺德挨刀的啊!你是出息了啊，离开我以为你了不起啊，感情你加入丐帮了啊!哼~这捯饬的很讲究啊哈。”行啊等着吧。

  一会儿瞧他吃，啊吃完了没钱，这儿成心的，这一说认罚，挺高兴。好，带他洗澡去吧。洗澡，换衣服，剃头，这都不提。都弄完了，侯德庆又过来了，

“掌柜的，都捯饬完了你看比我还精神呐啊，你看看啊，捯饬完啦。”

  “哦，你跟他说啊，对他来说还有一个活儿必须要干，要不然咱们这儿不要他。”

  “哈，对对，你看这差不多这个哈。我就说是不能饶了他么哈。嗯让他干熟(什)么呀?”

  “你告儿他，掌柜的我有一毛病，晚上睡觉的时候，得泡脚，他得给我洗脚。知道么，洗够两个小时了，给我搓脚搓的我困了为止。打这儿起连干三年，问他愿意么。”

  “你这就对了你看。我说不能饶他么……哎，过来问你点儿事儿，你以前干过足疗的么?啊?”

  “啊哈，没有。我就干过勤行儿。”

  “是，这个也得勤齐知道么，不勤齐不行，啊，俺们掌柜的说啦，晚上睡觉弄盆水给他洗脚，洗完给搓脚，搓完了搓仨小时他睡着啦，你算了事儿了，啊，连干三年，要不然现在，扒光了，扔院儿里，泼上水啊。啊，我我我我可作兴这行子咧知道么。”

  “我，我我我愿意。”

  不愿意不行啊，吃人家嘴短是吧，现在还钱没有，

  “我我我愿意。”啊，这儿回去一说，“嗯他愿意咧。”

  “行，今天晚上开始，我看他也困了，”这会儿已经下午五点来钟，

  “你把他送的我那屋去，啊在外头把锁锁上。”

  “好咧。”

  领着李鸣斋来到大奶奶睡觉这屋，人呐，有日子没跟床上睡觉了，一瞧床一瞧见被乎这亲呐!一脑袋扎上睡着了。侯德庆出来， 把锁锁上，转身忙活自己的去。这一天都忙活过去到晚上八点钟。挂上板儿，门都关好了，准备啊休息了。

  大奶奶把自己的这个贴身的衣服都准备完了，告诉侯德庆“啊那个，放狗你惊醒着点儿，我要睡觉了。”来到这儿，拧开钥匙，推门儿就进去了。

  侯德庆后边儿跟着呢，怎么呢，他想瞧一新鲜。心说“这个小子可够他受的啊，给人洗脚洗俩小时，搓仨小时，唉俺滴(的)娘啊可了不地了，我打今儿起我得对她好，嗯，我得对他好，回他哪天他跑了这个活儿落的我这儿可受不了。”

  啊，掌柜的进门儿，把门关上他瞧不见，他转的窗户这儿来，拿这个指甲呀窗户上捅一眼儿，木匠调线儿，一眼儿睁一眼儿闭往里瞧。黑咕隆咚瞧不见。

  大奶奶往屋一走，听见床上打呼噜声音，哎!李明斋!”李鸣斋蹭楞起来了，睡得迷迷糊糊

  “哦掌柜的掌柜的，我我在这儿呢我在这儿呢。”

  “嗯，你叫什么呀?”

  “我我叫叫李李李鸣斋。”大奶奶转身，坐的炕沿儿上，李鸣斋下地这儿站着，迷迷糊糊的。

  “叫李鸣斋呀。哪儿的人呐?”

  “嗯，我北京人。”

  “住哪儿啊?”

  “住天桥儿。”

  “哦，因为什么跑到外边儿来啦?”

  “嗨，我那个媳妇儿啊他偷野汉子…”

  “呸!你瞧见了么?”

  “是我这么琢磨着来着。”

  “哦，现如今呢?”

  “现如今我这不落魄了么，没有办法。”

  “嗯，我问你，我说那要求你都同意么?”

  “是，我这这一会儿我给您洗脚，我给您搓脚。我一定好好的工作啊哈。这个我保证搓的让您满意。”

  “嗯，我问你，你现在想不想回家呀?”

  “我想，我其实说良心话我自己这这这段时间我也琢磨来着，嗯保不齐是我自己琢磨错了，未必我媳妇儿干了对不起我的事儿。嗨，可是话说回来了，事到如今我也没脸回去了，说别的都晚了，我也我也就这样儿了，得了掌柜的，什么话甭说了，我给您洗脚吧。”

  “等会儿。”

  大奶奶打开随身的包袱，把自己外边儿的这身儿男人的衣服脱下来，贴身穿着兜兜，脑袋上把帽子一摘，头发也长了，头发披散下来，一回身，把这蜡点着了，蜡一亮屋里边儿一亮，窗户外边儿侯德庆吓一跳，“呀，掌柜的是个妖精!她是个妖精。明明是个男滴(的)，怎么一会儿的功夫变娘们了?我得看看她一会儿吃人不吃人。他要是吃人，我扭头就跑我告你吧哈。”跟这儿看着。

  屋里边儿李鸣斋一直低着头，这会儿呢蜡烛亮了也不好意思抬头，怎么呢，那么大老爷们给人家搓脚自己心里难受。肚子里边儿有只手抓自己不是滋味一直低着头儿。大奶奶拿手一指他，

  “嗨!你抬头瞧瞧我是谁呀。”

  “掌柜的…啊!哎呦媳妇儿，是你呀!?”

  “好小子，男子汉大丈夫你好大的能耐呀，事到如今你还说什么呀?”

哎呦我这，我我我不是说了么我后悔了，我错了，你饶了我吧，我，我我不敢了。”

  “嗯，既然这儿样儿说我就饶了你了。行了，天儿也不早了，上床睡觉吧。”刚说到这儿外边儿侯德庆喊上了，

  “掌柜的，什么事儿有个先来后到，先济着我呀!”

,
,She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone.

,To be alone
,
,I don't know ...

,I've just never seen any proof
,so I just don't debate it any more
,I could spend my whole life debating it over and over ...
,And still wouldn't have proof
,so I just don't debate it any more
,
,It's absurd

,Do you feel alone right now?
,The search for God is absurd?
,It is if everyone dies alone
,Does that scare you?

,Sara came in, stinking of Gin, said,
,“I got the time if you got the sin”

I was just a little girl
Peeking out of my momma's apron strings
I was just a little girl
But I knew what had to be
It would row, it would row
It would row all over me
I was just a little girl
What had to be
Easter dresses and choir robes
ballet slippers and pierced earlobes
I was just a little girl
But I knew the ways of this world
County fairs and church's bazarres
Swimming pools and muscle cars
I was nothing but a girl
But I knew the ways of the world
In the years peeled away
Like pages and pages of a novel
Grown men powerful men
They will fall at my feet to grovel
And they'll row, they will row
they will row all over me
But I am not a little girl
And I know, what has to be

,Jimmy won't you please come home
,Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
,Come see Jimmy your uncle Jim
,Your auntie Jimmie and your cousin Jim
,Come home Jimmy because you need a bath
,And your grandpa Jimmy is still gone daft
,
,Now there's buffalo Jim and buffalo Jim
,And Jim buffalo now didn't you know
,Jim Jim Jimmy it's your last cigarette
,But there's buffalo piss and it's all kind of wet
,Jambo Jimmy you'd better hold your nose
,All roads lead to roam with the buffaloes
,
,And the Buffaloes used to say be proud of your name
,The Buffaloes used to say be what you are
,The Buffaloes used to say roam where you roam
,The Buffaloes used to say do what you do
,
,Well you've gotta have a wash but you can't clean your name
,You're now called Jimmy you'll be Jimmy just the same
,The keys are in a bag in a chest by the door
,One of Jimmy's friends has taken the floor
,Jimmy won't you please come home
,Where the grass is green and the buffaloes roam
,Dear old Jimmy you've forgotten you're young
,But you can't ignore the buffalo song
,
,And the Buffaloes used to say be proud of your name
,The Buffaloes used to say be what you are
,The Buffaloes used to say roam where you roam
,The Buffaloes used to say do what you do
,If you remember you're unkown
,Buffaloland will be your home
,If you remember you're  a gnome
,Buffaloland will be your home
,If you remember you're  a Noam
,Buffaloland will be your home
,If you remember you're unkown
,Buffaloland will be your home

,Farewell and adieu, to you, Spanish Ladies.
,Farewell and adieu, to you, ladies of Spain.
,For we've received orders, to sail to old England.
,We hope in a short time to see you again.
,We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.
,We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas.
,Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England;
,From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.
,We hove our ship to with the wind from sou'west, boys.
,We hove our ship to, deep soundings to take.
,'Twas forty-five fathoms,with a white sandy bottom,
,So we squared our main yard and up channel did make.
,We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.
,We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas.
,Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England;
,From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.
,Now let every man drink off his full bumper.
,And let every man drink off his full glass.
,We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy.
,And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.
,So we will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.
,We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas.
,Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England;
,From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.﻿
,The first land we sighted was called the Dodman.
,Next Rame Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland and Wight;
,We sailed then by Beach, by felly and Dover.（
,And straight the way for the South Foreland light.
,We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.
,We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas.
,Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England;
,From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.
,Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor.
,
,Let go your shank painter, let go your cat.
,Haul up your clewgarnets, let tacks and sheets fly!
,We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.
,We'll rant and we'll roar all on the salt seas.
,Until we strike soundings in the channel of old England;
,From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.
,Now let ev'ry man drink off his full bumper.
,And let ev'ry man drink off his full glass.
,We'll drink and be jolly and drown melancholy,
,And here's to the health of each true-hearted lass.
,We will rant and we'll roar like true British sailors.

,Never play by the stairs, you're bound to fall down,
,Never play by the hillside, might slip and break your crown
,Never play by the fire, it's a danger to your health
,Never play by the wall, might fall and break yourself.
,Ah Ah Ah,
,Never play by the river, you might tumble in and drown,
,Never play by the field, get filthy, dirty and brown,
,Never play by yourself, it's a danger to be alone,
,Never stray too far away, it's not safe outside of home.
,Ah Ah Ah,
,I didn't ask to be born,
,And I don't think I'll ask to die.
,I didn't ask for the ground beneath my feet, I
,Didn't ask for the sky.
,All that I ask, my darling,
,All that I really ask of you,
,All that I ask, my darling,
,Is that you stay here with me.

,If A Song Could Be President
,We'd hum on Election Day
,The gospel choir would start to sway
,And we'd all have a part to play
,The first lady would free her hips
,Pull a microphone to her lips
,Break our hearts with Rhythm and Blues
,Steve Earle would anchor the news
,We'd vote for a melody
,Pass it around on an MP3
,All our best foreign policy
,Would be built on harmony
,If a song could be president
,We'd fly a jukebox to the moon
,All our founding fathers' 45's
,Lightnin' Hopkins and Patsy Cline
,If a song could be president
,If a song could be president
,We could all add another verse
,Life would teach us to rehearse
,Till we found a key change
,Break out of this minor key
,Half-truths and hypocrisy
,We wouldn't need an underachiever-in-chief
,If a song could be president
,We'd make Neil Young a Senator
,Even though he came from Canada
,Emmylou would be Ambassador
,World leaders would listen to her
,They would show us
,where our country went wrong
,Strum their guitars on the White House lawn
,John Prine would run the FBI
,All the criminals would laugh and cry
,If a song could be president

,
,Every single thing that I shouldn't do
,Seems to come so natural
,I don't know 'bout you
,Feeling so out of touch
,Staying inside too much
,Introducing all these hands but I'm out of luck
,Thought it'd be easier
,For me to think of her
,I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you
,Thought it'd be easier
,For me to think of her
,I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you
,Is there anything you need?
,Make you feel more comfortable
,Put your mind at ease
,So what do I do instead?
,When I think about every single thing
,Nodding through my head
,Keeping me inside
,Thought it'd be easier
,For me to think of her
,I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to you
,Thought it'd be easier
,For me to think of her
,I was dreaming as you spoke and not listenin' to

,Your mind would disagree I could tell
,When you smile does it let you wish me well
,Bore a cyclone every time you exhale
,I cut off the ground and now I'm unbounded
,But miss you around it
,That's why you should come and
,Sit me all about the mountains
,You used to kiss me like your lips
,Have caught fire,but no ties
,That smoke gets my eyes
,
,Blowback,call it blowback

,Should've listened to my pops!
,Should've listened to boogas,
,Man, why did I not?
,Because I, I really loved you
,Oh, I, I really loved you
,But you're a money hungry hoe
,Guess what I'm saying
,You told me that I was crazy
,Till I pulled up on your man and you

,I get a little stronger now
,I get a little braver now
,And when it gets dark
,I get a little brighter now
,I get a little wiser now
,before I give my heart away
,Well we met each other at the house of runaways
,I remember it perfectly
,we were running on honesty
,We moved together like a silver lock and key
,But now that your lock has changed
,I know I can't fit that way
,The playgrounds they get rusty
,and your heart beats another ten thousand times
,before I got the chance to say
,I want you
,When it gets hard
,I get a little stronger now
,I get a little braver now
,And when it gets dark
,I get a little brighter now
,I get a little wiser now
,before I give my heart away

,City of stars
,Are you shining just for me?
,City of stars
,There's so much that I can't see
,Who knows?
,I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
,That now our dreams
,They've finally come true
,
,City of stars
,Just one thing everybody wants
,There in the bars
,And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
,It's love
,Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
,A rush
,A glance
,A touch
,A dance
,
,To look in somebody's eyes
,To light up the skies
,To open the world and send them reeling
,A voice that says, I'll be here
,And you'll be alright
,I don't care if I know
,Just where I will go
,'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
,A rat-tat-tat on my heart…
,
,Think I want it to stay
,City of stars
,Are you shining just for me?

,那就从这座城市的西门开始
,有一条街沿少年们曾奔跑摔流血不止
,红色大门外杂乱无序的野草种子
,是我耳濡目染到最原始坚韧的性子
,未能经历时间洗礼的骄傲之子
,还远远读不懂青春不死那一首诗
,灰头土脸狂奔永不知疲惫的日子
,妈和爸狠狠赏过屁股上几棍子
,穿着破球鞋的人就这样渐渐长大
,年轻心脏的梦在不知不觉中发了芽
,扬帆远航乘风破浪要去惊讶天下
,生命的意义就是要纵情燃烧不怕留疤
,日月问少年能够不羁多少个四季
,少年说一定率性而行无所畏惧
,不管路上遇到妖魔鬼怪还是腥风血雨
,靠自己的拳头向着阳光生长坚定不移
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,清脆的酒瓶碰击声就在昨日
,八月的暴雨之后横空出世
,盛夏的野草疯狂侵略之势不可阻止
,混杂的汗水味每个人都屏息咬紧牙齿
,我听到不同颜色的人在呐喊我的名字
,不管那个声音是捍卫还是讽刺
,我都只想说一句不好意思
,因为我从来就不循规蹈矩服从压制的模子
,后来我渐渐离开了这座城市
,像更多心怀抱负的少年一样奋力展翅
,天大地大的精彩和危险才真正略知
,天花乱坠的诱惑和匿名口水满地充斥
,他们企图让我沦为被现实裹挟的人质
,我梗着脖子摇头低声说了个不字
,就算遍体鳞伤也要孤注一掷握紧旗帜
,戴上皇冠披上荆棘才是时代的样子
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长
,我知道攀登高峰的崎岖变得越来越难走了
,好多曾经一起追风的热血少年都朽了
,力不从心的时候说真的也想过放弃吧
,独自一人的坚持毕竟举步维艰啊
,这些都是你也有过的想法吧
,但我知道你绝不可能妥协吧
,虽然不同样子不同身世但追梦的初心一致
,我就是你心底绝不跪地求饶的倔强分子
,我已准备好踏上下一段新的征程
,我会不懈战斗直至生命最后一程
,狂风暴雨电闪雷鸣或者喝彩声
,独奏震耳欲聋的英雄交响永远精神
,我要如最初的那个西门少年
,不畏流血不惧流言不停奋力奔跑下去
,我要如最初的那个西门少年
,不畏流血不惧流言不停奋力奔跑下去
,野火烧不尽我们的野生野长

Ça m'embêterait
Qu'tu tire un trait
Qu'tu me laisse tomber
Le mois d'aout a Paris
Seule un été
A m'arroser
Vacances fichues
Le mois d'aout à pleurer
À me laisser aller
À traverser
Sans regarder
Le mois d'aout esseulé
Pleurer a Paris
Le mois d'août à Paris
Ça m'embêterait
Si on doit se fier à la place
Adieux nos projets
Qu'on devait suivre à la trace
Le café Terra
Exceptera
Découvrir ton cartier
Tes potes qui sont restés
Puis siffle nos gammes
Se faire appeler madame
Et rentrer
Dans ton lit tout petit
Le mois d'août à Paris
Mais je doute en quadrillé
Le mois d'août à Paris
Affecter le calendrier
Le mois d'août à Paris
Les vacances ce sont des croix cochées
Le mois d'août à Paris
Auquel je me suis accrochée
Le mois d'août à Paris
Si tu m'laissais
J'ai pas trop d'amis ici
Refaire ces paquets
Retrouver le midi
Invente des histoires
Faire croire que tout va bien
Mais qu'il faut rentrer
Les vacances écourtées
Et s'laisser aller
À traverser
Sans regarder
Le mois d'août esseulé
Et puis quitter Paris
Oui c'était bien
Oui c'était bien
Oui c'était bien
Oui c'était bien

,속절없이 빗속을 난 걸어가
,이유도 없는 그리움들은
,언제부턴가 나를 떠나지 않고
,멈출 수 없는 생각들을 다
,꺼내놓고서 퍼즐을 맞추려
,흩어진 조각에 날이 선 기억에
,베어버린 맘은 아파도
,멈출 순 없죠 무뎌져 갈까 봐
,없었던 게 돼버릴까 봐
,두 눈에 담지 못한 순간은
,하나둘씩 꿈속을 스쳐가고
,잡으려 애를 쓰면 모두 다
,사라진 채로 무심히 눈을 떠
,흩어진 조각에 날이 선 기억에
,베어버린 맘은 아파도

\"I need a doctor,\" said the boy to the man
To mend my soul and ease my bones
and give my life a plan
\"well hold on son,\" said the man with the grin
just be a man and have no plan and let your life begin
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
and be who you wanna be, you gotta try to find your own way
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
be who you wanna be everything right when you do your thing
everybody get some time to live
but it a long, so break out strong and find something to give
well close your eyes and listen to the sun
and do not know what you've been told and just do what you want
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
and be who you wanna be, gotta try to find your own way
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
be who you wanna be, everything is right when you do your thang
find your fire, follow yourself
your right there, never too far
tear your fences down
to keep to much in from ever coming out
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
be who you wanna be, gotta try to find your own way
play what you wanna play, say what you wanna say
be who you wanna be everything is right when you do your thang

,Got a state on your back, can you carry it? (Huh)
,Don't drop that dun-dun-dun
,The dunce in the cap was once in the back of the class
,Ain't know how to act, but I passed didn't I?

,I was sitting on a Futon Couch
,In a far off town where the desert meets the sea
,You were only wrapped in a towel when you walked out
,A spare room in my friend's house
,Oh, I feel I met you before
,Something inside me is trying to remember a story
,Oh, I think I've loved you, I've loved you before
,Something is tugging my sleeve like a secret, whispered from the future
,Maybe this is us, now
,Maybe this is us
,Hey, hey, whadda ya say?
,Wanna make history start today?
,Hey, boy, whadda ya say we jump?
,From here
,Hey, whadda ya thinking?
,Leaning against the kitchen sink
,'Cause I see everything now
,Sitting on this futon couch
,Sitting on this futon couch
,You were never gonna leave that town
,Where your friends always drop by, unannounced, for tea
,Oh, and where the pain of the world was swallowed
,When the sunset wiped you clean
,Oh, I knew I'd heard it before
,Nothing is changing
,Till everything changes at once

,Something was writing itself on the walls of our future hearts

,You'll be kissing me against the kitchen sink
,'Cause I see everything now
,Sitting on this futon couch

,Oh, 'cause I see water
,Spilling on the land
,I see a frosted window
,And the prints of a small hand
,I see the lights out
,Fingers intertwined
,I see a cup thrown in silence
,In the breaking of the night
,I see me walking towards you
,To the sound of Colin Hay
,I see the earth is split
,Down the centre of our plane
,But I see it's worth it
,'Cause I see it all now

,我说话总是直接 说爱你到明天
,总怀恋我们两个之间难得的相聚
,我们之间的关系 把对方手机关闭
,我想你怎么够 要把你放走
,下一根怎么roll 不想要放手

,你以前说过那么多的话
,让我怕 那就怕
,总是夜深人静卷了一根让我大
,还记得当初最开始我写的烂歌
,你还是给我鼓励 我亏欠你太多
,就算是歌不好听你也给我点赞
,你还是给我举例 把事情全都挑担
,我想做爱情的庄家
,想有好的三押
,还想在和你的感情里面当一个专家
,不想的都是不好的都是不想的
,情话我总是不讲的 不假的
,最后中靶了我变得更傻了
,也许离开我之后你变得更好了
,你说我变的太快
,这结局总是对外
,一直到现在我都记得你是怎么把我对待
,还记得那天晚上我一个人下楼吃饭
,看到你的瞬间我以为司空见惯
,还以为是从前 你那时的容颜
,我的一颗烂心变的一点不值钱
,我掉头就走 你悬在半空的手

,把想法全部都节制
,全都是爱你的形式
,把想法关机 心情太单一
,在爱情比赛里面我得到了先机
,我想要把你带走 不想要把你放走
,像表扬一个孩子吃饭吃的大口
,内心都太丑
,都做了生活的狗
,最后都输给了时间这个漏斗

【最深的恐惧来源于人类的内心深处】
【这个世界真的对内向的人充满恶意】
【人类比鬼魂恐怖】
这个道理谁都知道
但是真正去做自己内心想做的
去说出自己想要说出的
基本没有一个人
因为他们自己无能为力
恐惧着世俗效应
只能看见某件东西从而发出伪善的感叹
而不去改变
仍旧保持现状
无病**的抬高自己的处境
我能告诉你
所有艺术所衍生的仪式
直到现在还在无声进行
生存本身就是一场愚昧的祭奠
可笑的【你和我不一样 所以你不正常】的定义
零 / 寂静岭 / 地狱少女 / 以及各大悲剧的主角
基本上就相当于是那些命运绝望的频死之人
在他们活着的时候 
从不会有人过问
直到真相被公开
一群假惺惺的人在制造舆论
从而出显自己在某件事情上的一个定义
而那些无知的人
只会在一边发出那恶心的感叹
伪装出圣人的模样
你现在应该滚回你母亲的**重新塑造
然后成为那悲惨之人
去真正感受你所感叹的对象的痛苦。

,I let my sight be slayed
,If it meant that I could form a view
,I found another way
,To caress my day

,Remember when we first met?
,You said “light my cigarette”
,So I lied to my mom and dad
,And jumped the fence and I ran
,But we couldn’t go very far
,‘Cause you locked your keys in your car
,So you sat and stared at my lips
,And I could already feel your kiss
,
,Long nights, daydreams
,Sugar and smoke rings, I’ve been a fool
,But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
,Headlights, on me

,Blue eyes, black jeans
,Lighters and candy, I’ve been a fool
,But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
,
,Remember when you taught me fate
,Said it all be worth the wait
,Like that night in the back of the cab
,When your fingers walked in my hand
,Next day, nothing on my phone
,But I can still smell you on my clothes
,I was hoping that things would change
,But we went right back to your games

,It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
,I'm not one of those who can easily hide
,I don't have much money but boy if I did
,I'd buy a big house where we both could live
,If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
,Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
,I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
,My gift is my song and this one's for you
,And you can tell everybody this is your song
,It may be quite simple but now that it's done
,I hope you don't mind
,I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
,How wonderful life is while you're in the world
,I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
,Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
,But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
,It's for people like you that keep it turned on
,So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
,You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
,Anyway the thing is what I really mean
,Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

,I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
,How wonderful life is while you're in the world
,
,Today when I see your lipstick stain
,On my last nice shirt, it cues my brain
,To think about you
,Every second or two
,I always knew if I could find a girl
,Who sees the way I see the world
,I'd give her my life
,Will you give me your life?
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Say you will
,Picture this
,Me and you
,Little house with a rim brand hue
,Well this country town
,As the sun drops down
,And on the other side of that window pane
,A storm might spin that weather vane
,But we can rise above
,If you feel my love
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Girl you're my rhapsody
,The sound of your symphony
,Is a thousand violins
,When life's stray stars collide
,And with our two hearts tonight
,And the circle has no end
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in, breathe out with me
,You'd be the words to an unwritten song
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Say you will
,Wade out into the water
,Breathe in with me (say you will)
,I'd be the melody
,Don't let your lips be still
,Don't let your lips be still
,Say you will

,I don't want someone telling me what to do

,I don't want somebody telling me what's not right
,But I just want you to love me
,Oh I just want you to love me

,And the words are written in invisible ink
,And now the world is changing and I can barely keep up
,Cause what was hot is over and what was down is not now

Oh, I love this house, I love this house
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, I love to hear those conkers fall
Smash 'em on an Southwark stone
And I love that here you live with me
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
Yes, I've been too long a rolling stone
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned
Oh, I love the curling of your hair
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Recited Butler Yeats there in your grace
Your grace, your grace
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned
Returned
Returned
And if I had to die today
Scatter my ashes on this place
And I live on in your grieving heart
But until that day that we depart
Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Only love makes house a home
Home
Home
Home
This house is home

,On that and black white kitchen floor
,I sometimes wonder if that house
,Is even there, anymore
,I had my first glimpse of love
,When I was five
,I watched two people split apart
,But still the three of us survived
,I've seen the best
,
,I've seen the worst
,
,I wouldn't change what I've been through
,I've touched the sky
,I've hit the wall
,
,But I did what I had to
,
,On my way here
,Where I am now
,I've learned to fly
,I have to want to leave the ground
,I've fallen hard
,But I've been loved
,And in the end it all works out
,
,My faith has conquered fear
,
,On my way here.
,
,My address has changed
,
,Almost every year
,I've found that standing still
,Can quickly make a lifetime disappear
,I'd rather try and fail
,A thousand times denied
,And this, whenever you feel pain
,It lets you know that you're alive
,I've been a fool
,I've been afraid
,
,Yeah, I've been loved
,I've been lied to
,
,I've been wrong
,
,And I've been right
,
,I stood up when I had to
,
,On my way here
,Where I am now
,I've learned to fly
,I have to want to leave the ground
,I've fallen hard
,But I've been loved
,
,And in the end it all works out
,
,My faith has conquered fear
,
,On my way here
,No guarantees
,I believed that I would find
,An open door or a light
,To lead me to the other side
,
,I guess that is why
,
,On my way here
,Where I am now
,I've learned to fly

,if i believe that i could do anything,
,could i, spread my wings and say goodbye
,so many people told me i couldn’t win
,but look at me now , here i am in heaven’s sky
,and sometimes i say a prayer
,wishing that you could be here with me, cos i believe

,baby, i’ve got one foot in the door
,yes i do
,all the years of waiting for your approval dear
,well i realised i don’t need it anymore
,‘cause i’m stronger everyday,
,now i’m strong enough to say, i believe
,i believe in love, it’s the best of everything
,i believe in hope and the changes it can bring
,if you believe then nothing can stand in your way
,i believe
,
,it’s a fact of life that we’re all in the game
,but it’s still your call
,but we all play it
,sometimes we win, sometimes we fall
,but that’s no reason just to give it up, cause after all
,if you can’t choose what to be
,you can choose what to dream
,and i believe
,i believe in love, it’s the best of everything
,i believe in hope and the changes it can bring
,if you believe then nothing can stand in your way

,
,I’m marching to Zion
,A camera in my hand
,I hear people cryin’
,Dyin’ for this blood-stained land
,The streets of old Jerusalem
,Are lined with souvenirs and those buying them
,It sounds cold, but I cannot see
,How this theme park has shaped history
,Cause virgins don’t have babies
,And water isn’t wine
,And there’s a holy spirit maybe
,But she would never rent a room with walls built by mankind
,Mary and Mohammed
,Are screaming through the clouds
,For you to lay your goddamned arms down
,Rip your bigot roots up from the earth and salt the goddamned ground
,Stand in line patiently
,To supercharge your rosary
,Or stuff your prayers inside this wall
,We once had god trapped in this great hall
,But we’ve been cast out from this place
,They say a prophet floated from here to outer space
,Am I crazy? maybe it’s me
,But this all sounds like mythology
,Cause virgins don’t have babies
,And water isn’t wine
,And there’s a holy spirit maybe
,But she would never rent a room with walls built by mankind
,Mary and Mohammed
,Are screaming through the clouds
,For you to lay your goddamned arms down
,Rip your bigot roots up from the earth and salt the goddamned ground
,Zeus was afraid of his girlfriend
,So he swallowed her in bed
,Then he bore forth Athena
,When they cracked open his head
,Her brother tried to rape her
,Athena got away
,And when his seed hit the ground
,The grass gave birth that day
,Now we all freely admit
,This story’s clearly bullshit
,No one would lay down their life
,Or start a war for it
,So throw your stones and pray
,You’ll be rewarded someday
,I hope it all goes your way
,But something tells me
,No one’s coming to save you
,No one’s coming to save you
,No one’s coming to save you
,Save yourselves
,From turning earth into hell
,No one’s coming to save you

,When You Were My Girl
,Anthony Callea
,
,/flyingfish07/
,When you were my girl, there were times you'd look at me
,And I knew exactly how it felt to be loved
,When you were my girl, I don't know if I told you
,But whenever I'd hold you, it scared me so much
,
,You were all that I needed, you were all that I had
,The one I could turn to, when the world had gone mad
,And I guess I just wanted, for you to know that
,(Chorus)
,Not a day goes by I don;t think of you
,(Do you...ever...think of me when you're alone)
,Or I don't ask myself why
,(Do you...ever...wonder how things could have gone)
,If everything's so perfect now
,(Do you...ever...think of me and start to cry)
,Why do I cry all the time
,I didn't cry
,When you were my girl
,When you were my girl
,
,When I was your man, if I took you for granted
,Please understand it was my foolish heart
,Girl you were my best friend, baby your love completed me
,I loved you completely, just as you are
,
,And if you couldn't feel that, then how I regret
,That I never told you, all the things I should've said
,But I guess that's one chance that I'll never get
,Not a day goes by I don;t think of you
,(Do you...ever...think of me when you're alone)
,Or I don't ask myself why
,(Do you...ever...wonder how things could have gone)
,If everything's so perfect now
,(Do you...ever...think of me and start to cry)
,Why do I cry all the time
,I didn't cry
,
,And now I'm walking this world without you
,And with every step I take
,I find out every day
,How much further my heart can break - oh yeah
,
,I don't understand why
,We let something so beautiful
,Just fade and die
,We should have tried
,One more time
,When you were my girl
,When you were my girl
,
,
,
,
,
,hold my hand
,i am afraid
,please pray for me
,when i am away
,comfort the girl
,help her understand
,that no memory
,no matter how sad
,and no violence
,no matter how bad
,can darken the heart
,or tear it apart
,Chords
,take my hand
,when you are scared
,and i will pray
,if you go back out there
,comfort the man
,help him understand
,that no floating sheet
,no matter how haunting
,and no secret
,no matter how nasty
,can poison your voice
,or keep you from joy

,Is anybody there?
,I come up for air
,Feels like I’m drowning
,Does nobody care?
,It makes no sense at all
,Such a long way to fall
,I knew it was coming
,I could feel it in the air
,Feels like I’m falling
,Its time but you’re stalling
,You said all you need is
,A little time and some space
,These words that you’ve spoken
,Have left me so broken
,Seems at this moment
,That I’ve fallen from grace
,Is anyone around?
,My head hits the ground
,I feel like I’m no one
,I’m lost in the crowd
,It makes no sense at all
,So divided we fall
,I’m breaking my silence
,But you don’t hear me call
,And you don’t see me fall
,Feels like I’m falling
,It’s time but you’re stalling
,You said all you need is
,A little time and some space
,These words that you’ve spoken
,Have left me so broken
,Seems at this moment
,That I’ve fallen from grace
,And everyday just seems the same
,I try so hard to walk away
,From everything I am
,Just closing in on me
,I just can’t face the pain
,I sit around and wonder why
,So many dreams can fade and die
,Well nothing is forever
,Everything is never
,And I can’t say good bye
,Feels like I’m falling
,It’s time but you’re stalling
,You said all you need is
,A little time and some space
,These words that you’ve spoken
,Have left me so broken
,Seems at this moment
,That I’ve fallen from grace
,Seems I’ve fallen fallen from grace
,I’ve fallen，I’ve fallen

,那时我在睡梦中

,到处都是沐浴露的味道
,暖风替我抚摸过她们胸口
,吹开她们的衣裳

,一个人走在路上
,在寒冷的冬天里
,看他们在车里晃荡
,黄昏的时候
,去CBD走一走
,总有人替我将她们抱着
,亲吻在每一个路口
,
,日子总是轻飘飘地走着
,也许我们终究会一事无成
,过完这个冬天我就离开这里
,去陌生的地方开始新的生活
,生活总是一天天没有变化

我给你的备注是十二
十二是家人，是朋友是恋人
十二的另一个名字叫难忘
所以我不会走
你都不知道后来我又给你写了好多信
信封还是和原来的一个样
信纸我全都换成了纯白色
因为你说这样我还可以练习画画
信的开始我还是会给你分享一首歌
也是只分享给你的歌
在过去的2415个日子里
我能想象你一边听着歌一边读信的模样
你会皱眉也会笑得和一个孩子一样
你会耐心的去体会着我所有的喜怒哀乐
你会告诉我你一直都在
所以在你没有真正给我告别之前我都会给你写信
一直不停的写
我知道你会回信也知道你会来给我告别
所幸的是那一天还很早
因为寻梦环游记里有这样一句话是
“一个人彻底从这个世界上消失的时候是最后一个记得他的人不再记得他的时候”
你知道的无论如何我都会记得
记得你的每一个样子
所以“别怕”这一次换我来说
你是我最最可爱的大男孩
在无数个快要熬不下去的日子里
第一个想起的总是你
你给的每一次感动都像阳光一样洒落我心房
所以你依然是我坚持下去的理由
最近在听《走马》里面有段歌词是
“过了很久终于我愿抬头看
你就在对岸走的好慢
任由我独自在假寐与现实之间两难
过了很久终于我愿抬头看
你就在对岸等我勇敢
你还是，我的，我的，我的，你看”
我试图去唱这首歌
每次唱到这里时就开始哽咽心疼得厉害
你知道的我还没那么勇敢
是啊这个世界也就只有你知道
我没那么懂事，没那么坚强
所以十二你要一直在
你知道的我有半夜敲文字的习惯
可能一敲就是几小时
好多次都把自己搞成了失眠
然后硬着头皮赶路
刚开始的时候你总说我的
我总不听，索性你也敲起了文字
然后一起失眠
以至于现在给了我一种错觉就是你的随想录每天都是在更新的
我和大猫每过一段时间都会去看你写的东西
大猫还和我说当时也许是你太懒了
写的东西太少了，夜却漫长得很
你看，他还是这个样子，偶尔深沉得不像话
那天大猫在南城工作室的账号里写了个心情
大概是又许了自己一个五年
我猜他一定等着你和他一起庆祝
关于我的梦想
是你一点点的让我从迷茫变得不迷茫
让我无数多个小梦想都一一实现了
你知道我要想的是什么
其实我都无所谓的，你知道我会等的
你知道我会把所有勇气都留给你的
你也知道你给我的所有我都能给你的
这一次换我替你去看看这个世界
换我替你去实现你所有梦想
换我为你奋不顾身
往后再不可能出现和你一样的人
所以你最珍贵

最后我想再认认真真的想你一遍
以后我再也不和别人分享你了
所有人都会走，但我不会
此生故事太漫长，又何妨
余生把你写成一首歌
一字一句全记在心头
所以你好，所以再见
全世界对我最好的你

你出现在我的面前
拿着三年之约
你笑的那么甜

你曾经说过
三年后再见面
如果我有钱
我们就结婚

,城市里散播着讯号
,关于你我却找不到
,当天空聚集了飞鸟
,他们就在风雨中依靠
,你在寒夜里失眠
,盯着窗台期待着夏天
,汽车被雪埋在路边
,而我忽略了时间
,你爱的他已经走远你却更怀念从前
,你写的诗篇飘在了昨天
,你对镜子许下的诺言却像熊熊的火焰
,是你爬向明天的锁链
,你又一次熬到了五点 在你自己的房间
,告诉自己最后一次然后许愿
,把痛苦一次次修练，在你自己的空间
,有个人正在和你飞向零点
,城市里散播着讯号
,关于你我却找不到
,当天空聚集了飞鸟
,你在寒夜里失眠

,看了眼手机上的时间 下次再也不能晚睡
,幻想着我能闯出片天 希望谁都不会反对
,和我兄弟从来没有胆怯 直视眼前的 山
,像树叶随风中摇曳 要挂最华丽的 帆
,为攀登生活中的高山 我买了新的登山服
,发誓要霸占山顶 要做一只下山虎
,规定的目标 我和兄弟伙 一起慢慢实现
,也有过错的 惹了祸的 大不了再来一遍
,人活着 不可能 每件事 像希望 中那样圆满
,发过誓 要做的 拼全力 就让它 陀螺般旋转
,我可能像你像他或她被生活一次次 打败
,但我知道你们也和我一样不想在 这里被淘汰
,抱怨的话题说太多会像祥林嫂
,少刷点微博吧因为明天要起早
,不想再被拉开距离 所以开启了疾跑
,但愿你们都能一样 一起为所有人祈祷

,I close my eyes and I see your face
,But you're not there
,Like a vision
,It haunts me everywhere
,Every night I'm on a journey
,Cold sweat in my hair
,I'm going crazy
,And I'm deep down in despair
,I fancy nights - I'm lost in passion
,I just can't wait
,It's right before me
,But it fades just when I wake
,Don't you know - I'm falling
,I'm hiding in my fantasy
,You know - I'm calling
,But you just slip away from me
,Won't you please come back again
,I still hear the words like magic
,Calling out your name
,My search for you
,Is drivin' me insane
,What does it take - what can I do
,Who's telling me
,I want you back in my arms
,Set me free
,Don't you know - I'm falling
,I'm hiding in my fantasy
,You know - I'm calling
,But you just slip away from me
,Won't you please come back again
,So won't you please come back again
,I can't remember what went on in my head
,Why did this happen to me - to be
,Wait for an answer that I never will get
,'Cause it's just my fantasy
,Don't you know - I'm falling
,I'm hiding in my fantasy
,You know - I'm calling
,But you just slip away from me
,You know - I'm falling
,I'm hiding in my fantasy

,喜欢在家里抱你 特别当雷鸣暴雨
,你可以做任何的尝试我不会觉得暴力
,想对你做一些 乱七八糟的事情
,然后按照剧情的发展我们情不自禁
,或许因为费洛蒙 闻到你甜甜的气息
,或许靠的太近 分不清是你还是自己
,太刺激 都是你

,不再为了谁而赌气
,不会再漫无目的的追寻着自己
,当你落寞无助的时候
,再把这首歌给唱起

,这首献给那些没长大的小朋友
,时间还早呢其实离长大还有足够久
,记得三岁我就想要一只小猫或者小狗
,今年六月十二我领养了女儿叫豆豆
,一开始它很胆小甚至不敢吃东西
,在房间寻找角落想躲进某个小阴影
,我越是想抓它它越是把我给挠挠醒
,满手臂都是抓痕和摔出来的小淤青
,高贵的小动物怎么可能听我的命令
,我只好躺在床上关灯再顺便玩玩手机
,这时它反而慢慢朝我靠近
,假装不看我只是
,发出呼呼呼的声音躺我肚子中心
,善良与天真
,是你的宝藏 宝藏
,好奇的眼神
,要看的更广
,更广
,铲屎官不停给你献上一根根鱼干
,请理下逗猫棒
,我们的关系开始越变得越来越亲密
,从我满衣服的猫毛你就能看出我的无奈
,每天做铲屎官还要拌个海鲜包做午餐
,而它12小时睡觉6小时在发呆
,手机一充电它就挠挠手机充电线
,在键盘上瞎跑顺便再按按我的录音键
,当我指着它的鼻子骂它却装作不听见
,我打了个电话告诉蒋蒋 这家伙有多难养
,才十秒转头它已经拆了我的吸音墙
,我大喊一声你怎么不去领个多动症奖
,说完这句豆豆就跳上我膝盖给了我一个巴掌
,善良与天真
,是你的宝藏 宝藏
,好奇的眼神

,铲屎官不停给你献上一根根鱼干

,如果你不敢出门就别再每天对外叫
,真的带上了链子到了野外又怂的无可救药
,在家里称王在外面被别的野猫给欺负
,我用朋友圈小视频记录
,细数它日复一日 原形毕露
,这就是所谓的因果报应
,从你偷吃鱼干那刻这现实就已经注定
,你活在幸福的温床就要好好珍惜现在
,有多少的野猫可以度过城市的冬季在现代
,在人来人往的世界生存空间变的拥挤
,我不止一次看见小动物在被人遗弃
,那些人是否记得抱养曾是以爱的名义
,它最信任的你请陪它走完短暂的生命

,Verse 1:
,打开陈旧的电脑又一次敲起了键盘
,房屋中都是新的可生活都让我厌烦
,到底如何才能够把你全部都忘记
,五年的相识经历无论如何都无法放弃
,多么想见你一面看看几年来的改变
,还想要陪你完成去你梦想中的海边
,曾经约你出门游玩你从来不会说改天
,最深刻的一次我在网吧 你替我买烟
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱
,可我已把你输掉 可我已把你输掉
,Verse 2:
,我们第一次登山照片还在橱柜里面
,几年前最后的分手在一个下雨天
,种种的回忆 脑海中形成了很多的画面
,你不知道 我对你有多么挂念
,录的每一首Demo来自你送我的设备
,那时穷屌丝一个并且刚刚踏入社会
,你不嫌弃并支持想起来至今都落泪
,当初的年少轻狂致使我分不清错对
,太多的误会幼稚导致让我把你失去
,写很多歌但一半都是关于你的诗句
,我忘不了青春时所留下的每份记忆
,想要对你关怀说爱也许只能在梦里
,我知道你想要的不多只是图个安稳
,可当初的满腔热血只想在社会中翻滚
,到最后 任性的结果你选择了离开
,记得那杯白酒和那首 I want fly
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱
,可我已把你输掉 可我已把你输掉
,Verse 3:
,ye 有人说时间能够帮我磨灭一切
,可为何唯独我的思念一夜又一夜
,耳边还能想起你对我说的 一生一世
,这个美梦太漫长了做到 今时今日
,离开我这么久你是否会 感到遗憾
,那个他对你的好 你是否会习惯
,希望他知道你最喜欢的 不是汽水
,也许某一天我会出现但是我会闭嘴
,我明白 这失败你不怪我我不怪你
,最后我想说分手后我一直 还爱你
,Hook:
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱
,可我已把你输掉 可我已把你输掉
,怪我曾爱你爱的太深 一直都活在梦里
,想到你新娘的装扮 想在你身旁送你
,寒冷的冬夜没有温暖 想给你一个拥抱

,我藏在你的背后
,也找了很多的借口
,我只是顺路走走
,是太热不是害羞
,想解开疑惑的谜团
,又不让你怎样
,你要往北我家在南
,也想悄悄的跟上
,hey my boy
,就想跟在你身后
,看着你背影依旧
,脸红心跳是偷偷幻想中能牵你手
,hey my boy
,有很多的办法
,不让你知道我的存在
,可是你会知道吗
,我现在好孤单
,他喜欢清纯女孩 戒了浓妆超可爱
,喜欢简单的唇彩 感性同时也要骨感
,所以薯片丢了吧
,把它换成纯牛奶
,当然爱一个人的同时
,先学会自爱
,怎么让完美的自己
,能够站到你的身边
,这是一个大问题
,一直让我很纠结
,害怕自己不够好
,得到的答案是无解
,所以一直都在当透明人
,藏在你后面
,他们不了解
,总以为是腼腆
,baby别看表面
,只是不爱表现
,哪有那么肤浅
,对你的爱蓄势待发
,所以要唱这首歌
,大声的跟你说句话
,想陪你走到世界尽头
,我早已经丢掉所有
,如果能够在你左右
,想陪走你到时间尽头
,逛遍世界每个角落
,因为有你已经足够
,很多的时候 我只能记得你的背面
,偶尔眼神碰撞
,却连忙道歉说抱歉
,sorry诶 我有错吗
,总默默的偷看 你的侧脸
,想和你说句话
,思前想后又是止步不前
,再也不要这样的暗恋
,想大胆和你谈恋爱
,会觉得很草率吗
,可你的笑在脑袋里不断的绕
,我是真的喜欢你啊
,恭喜你占便宜了
,我是暗恋你的她
,不是坏人更不是变态呀
,想说我喜欢你啊
,撒拉嘿呦 在一起吧
,肯定要问我特别多的问题
,为什么要喜欢你
,干净的衬衣配着你
,所以甘愿变成你的kiyomi
,想给你写一首史上最暖的情歌
,想和你一起感受寒冷或炽热
,想热恋牵着你走过春夏秋冬天
,你知道都是不多言的我为你而写
,想陪你走到世界尽头
,我早已经丢掉所有
,如果能够在你左右
,想陪走你到时间尽头
,逛遍世界每个角落
,因为有你已经足够
,想给你写一首史上最暖的情歌
,想和你一起感受寒冷或炽热
,想热恋牵着你走过春夏秋冬天
,你知道这是为你而写

,关心那短信不会翻新 一个三字问题情书
,简单又浪漫不需要特别的烛光午餐
,我要睡了你呢没事只是想道个晚安
,你已经成为我的习惯 这小小羁绊
,让喜欢在空气中弥漫 这问题不替换也没关系
,多想有说不完的话题 把你和我的生活拉扯在一起
,三个字也许单调 但感情十分立体 找刺激 的自己
,只能停留在记忆里 尽管相隔几亿里 也要拥抱你
,哪怕相隔一厘米 也在想念你 即使看不见的脑袋里
,也能看到你的*体 让我随时随地都能一下子*起

,颜韵YCY:
,他时常做着梦，微笑也带着痛。
,他不知自己出生的目的，还有什么用。
,以为离开了家。离开了爸和妈。
,可以只手遮天。不会倒下自己才是老大
,他错了，才明白成长需要过程。
,先学会做人，才能够拥有哪些获得。
,他以为可以，让自己变得得体。
,他忘乎所以，才发现自己也是命运的蝼蚁。
,当他开始踏如社会，自己活得越来越累。
,才明白有些事情失去后才叫真贵
,上帝不会发慈悲，不会眷恋生活的累赘。
,只有脚踏实地努力，才不会活得颓废。
,当你做到一家独大，想没想过汗如雨下。
,就算前方太多荆棘告诉自己不要害怕。
,你总是说你老了 但是你还有你的家人。
,你可以对不起全世界，但不能对不起他们。

,他也渴望有人陪伴会对他说声晚安
,他也想要去很多地方看看世界的璀璨
,他也讨厌做很多事但他不能去厌烦
,为了生存 他也只能每天埋头苦干
,试图去接近他想要的那个彼岸
,他有的时候也会感觉到心烦意乱
,但他坚信只要度过一切都会变得简单
,生活总会带来潮起潮落的波澜

,而他们不在乎我成与败只在意我的身体
,当我长大了要在这个现实的噩梦中醒
,拖着七尺之躯也要扛起来我的一片天地

,您一定要好好过 我会跟您常联系

,小胖KungFu-Pen：
,看过全是阴的天
,走过全是泥的田
,想要地球绕一圈
,却困在人类动物园
,赚了没必要的脸
,花了没必要的钱
,只希望没必要的争端
,没必要再出现
,我的胡思乱想总是流露出
,我像一个游牧民族
,到处种下自由的树
,一路感谢兄弟们的求助
,在姑娘家的留宿
,也留不住我通向自由之路
,于是背上了背包 耳机play loud
,当所有人都睡着
,而我在路上飞高
,三千里路云和月
,音乐让有心的耳朵都听得见 uh uh
,我爱上这个世界的五颜六色
,却痛恨风景依旧却不念旧客
,它告诉我你只将自己灵魂拥有
,其他一切生在自然 死不带走
,还有三千人没会 还有三千事不会
,才走三千里所以 才饮三千杯不醉
,当我走过人生第一个三千里
,才发现我还走在这小山间里
,小胖KungFu-Pen：

,继续走着
,西奥Sio：
,前有三千里的沙漠
,后有三千鲜艳花朵
,三千块的出场费
,差不多我为你花过
,三千花丛中间过去 忍住 你不要墨迹
,所有逢场作戏在我这里消失得彻底
,当我走到沙漠中才发现周围的人大都疯
,拿着剑 互相劈砍 像积攒 了许多年的怨言
,难怪人们渐渐的 变得十分危险
,可怕的嘴脸 对彼此垂涎
,更让我看不明白的是海市蜃楼楼阁亭台
,天边那一片云彩 并不是我要的
,所以往前走
,拆穿地平线的谎言
,我不管地球是方是圆
,我都要一往直前

,我过的浑浑噩噩
,和homie燃烧生命保持街头的特色
,妞爱得瑟我随便策策 冷饭你拿去热热
,这一路上无聊就拿你当段子逗大家乐呵

,长沙下雪了 我这里好冷
,好怀念你的体温和你的咬吻
,突然好想回家我被孤单瞄准
,抱歉 没衣锦还乡妈你还得啃老本
,那年离开家带的很少行李
,外面世界很大原来一直在井底
,很少电话你 虽不用去电话亭投硬币
,你知道我煽情的话总像病句
,外面的月亮根本没家里圆
,是否会怀念那个bad boy乱花你钱
,总问命运 梦想实现还差几年
,在没有cblock 没有遇到她以前
,颓废了无数次 也做了糊涂事
,学会了抽烟曾今靠 度日

,背井离乡像顽疾根本无处治
,这几年不好不坏 过得中等也会想家
,外面的世界比想象中冷那年我太傻
,关上床头灯的夜晚
,思念总在我耳边烦
,故人西辞黄鹤楼 游子还在楼这头
,点上一根来消愁
,在异乡漂流 像一只小舟
,看着长江岸上的游客和导游
,游客和游子 是不同的感受
,对家的乡愁只有靠照片挽救
,好想告诉家人我在武汉的奇遇
,拿起电话 却又说不上几句
,走之前把baby照片偷偷藏下
,还没离开几天就想着长假
,原谅我太自我不善于表达
,但说真的 有你们在的地方才叫长沙
,我还是那年温馨圣诞的那个笨蛋
,从长沙到武昌还在演着阿胖正传
,我知道想要战胜思念没有太大胜算
,我只想听爸爸骂吃妈妈做的饭
,这几年不好不坏 过得中等 也会想家
,外面的世界比想象中冷那年我太傻
,关上床头灯的夜晚
,思念总在我耳边烦
,太多回家的列车我却不能回去 bring me back home
,每次节日里狂欢之后的party  bring me back home
,孤单的夜里电话那头你的声音 bring me back home
,那是梦里湿透枕头的一首旋律 bring me back home
,这几年不好不坏 过得中等 也会想家

,北方的村庄住着一个南方的姑娘
,她总是喜欢穿着带花的裙子站在路旁
,她的话不多但笑起来是那么平静悠扬
,她柔弱的眼神里装的是什么 是思念的忧伤
,南方的小镇阴雨的冬天没有北方冷
,她不需要臃肿的棉衣去遮盖她似水的面容
,她在来去的街头留下影子芳香在回眸人的心头
,眨眼的时间芳香已飘散影子已不见
,南方姑娘 你是否习惯北方的秋凉
,南方姑娘 你是否喜欢北方人的直爽
,日子过的就像那些不眠的晚上
,她嚼着口香糖对墙满谈着理想
,南方姑娘 我们都在忍受着漫长
,南方姑娘 是不是高楼遮住了你的希望
,
,昨日的雨曾淋漓过她瘦弱的肩膀
,夜空的北斗也没有让她找到迷途的方向
,阳光里她在院子中央晾晒着衣裳
,在四季的风中她散着头发安慰着时光
,南方姑娘 你是否爱上了北方
,南方姑娘 你说今天你就要回到你的家乡
,思念让人心伤 她呼唤着你的泪光
,南方的果子已熟 那是最简单的理想
,啦……啦……

,我的理想把我丢在这个拥挤的人潮

名もない花には名前を付けましょう この世に一つしかない
冬の寒さに打ちひしがれないように 誰かの声でまた起き上がれるように
土の中で眠る命のかたまり アスファルト押しのけて
会うたびにいつも 会えない時の寂しさ
分けあう二人 太陽と月のようで
実のならない花も 蕾のまま散る花も
あなたと誰かのこれからを 春の風を浴びて見てる
桜の花びら散るたびに 届かぬ思いがまた一つ
涙と笑顔に消されてく そしてまた大人になった
追いかけるだけの悲しみは 強く清らかな悲しみは
いつまでも変わることの無い
無くさないで 君の中に 咲く Love・・・
街の中見かけた君は寂しげに 人ごみに紛れてた
あの頃の 澄んだ瞳の奥の輝き 時の速さに汚されてしまわぬように
何も話さないで 言葉にならないはずさ
流した涙は雨となり 僕の心の傷いやす
人はみな 心の岸辺に 手放したくない花がある
それはたくましい花じゃなく 儚く揺れる 一輪花
花びらの数と同じだけ 生きていく強さを感じる
嵐 吹く 風に打たれても やまない雨は無いはずと
桜の花びら散るたびに 届かぬ思いがまた―つ
涙と笑顔に消されてく そしてまた大人になった
追いかけるだけの悲しみは 強く清らかな悲しみは
いつまでも変わることの無い
君の中に 僕の中に 咲く Love・・・
名もない花には名前を付けましょう この世に一つしかない
冬の寒さに打ちひしがれないように 誰かの声でまた起き上がれるように

Empty a clip of hollow tips into your daughter's face'
Cause that's just the type of shit that 
I'm onCollect my dough make the fuckin' hit and

Infrared to your head will make sure

Fly one more time for good luck
For what? 
He was already dead, what the fuck?
I be breakin' my shit up off in a nigga
When I don't see nothin' but soft in a nigga
Fuckin' coward 
I wonder how it feels
To have to look at your moms squeal after 
I hit her with the steel
Ill that's how a nigga blows shit up believe whoever 
I hit up will never get up
Tell me how it's goin' down nigga if 
I'm bein' a fuckin' clown nigga
Take a couple of rounds nigga, 
I keep a toast real close
In case I gotta turn the rest of your peeps into ghosts
Fuck it I'm ready for combat with a gat
That'll make any nigga become a meal for the fuckin' rats
There won't be nothin' left of money but a soup bone
Big motherfuckin'

I was gonna make it happen that's the way 
I feltYou know

Doin' it my way you bitches strugglin' for help

But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it go head let you warm up the crowd for me
I hate to even be like this you all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me 
I scream it out
Sick wid' it ain't a bitch that can get wid' it
Admit it I'm that bitch you can't live wid' it
And I'ma keep it comin' long as

Now I'm done with you fuck out my face wastin' my time

Yeah, aiyyo, 
I got a wet haze coke and a 
P-blow block
But you all still missin' the point like a free throw shot
Get it this ain't some you learn this is some you earn
Turn it up and give me some to burn
That boy kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone so try to get a hell of a plan'
Cause most dudes left the hood broke
A couple knew what they was doin' so they came back like good coke
Down south they'll tell you, kiss is good folk
Up north I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out west they ridin' with me now 
I'm back hard
I'm just worried 'bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys one's 
God and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 
Kiss is the monster
D-Block and double 
R is my sponsor
Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk

,Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
,Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
,I had to figure it out;
,"It's the best," no, that's a lie
,Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
,High on my own, it took time to realize
,Because the Internet, mistakes are forever
,But if we fuck up on this journey,
,At least we're together
,Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
,Make 'em believe in themselves,

,First person to move, first person to speak
,My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
,Losing my frame of reference,
,These pieces of shit for breakfast
,Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
,I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
,She beautiful in the face,
,But her voice is truly amazing
,Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
,Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
,No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
,Niggas take her props like a musical live and learn
,She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
,I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
,Every night I text her "I wanna solve the world,
,I think I need your help"
,She text me "How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
,I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
,And I could've died like my iPhone,
,But I kept going like a psycho
,And I took chance like a dice roll,
,Dropping jewels like it's puberty
,Wrote a note on the glass:
,"You see what these labels do to me?"
,Texts said, "I'm wet";
,I said, "Hold up, wait up a minute"
,H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep all my failings exposed?
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good just can't function no more?

When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

,Now let me just go home I'll go home alone
,Oh baby I just don't know I don't know I don't
,Now let me just find my way home on my own
,Was it you that, in the midst of my dreams
,Never let another fall for you
,Endlessly, I see all the faces they go, go alone
,But why'd you make me, believe indefinitely

,I said I'm doing fine that's not the truth
,Can't handle life and I'm not in a boot
,You say you got a gun but I know you won't shoot

,And I plague on how the hell to plan for that
,I have a plan to buy her her first bicycle
,I have a plan to walk her to school
,I have a plan to take pictures of her on her prom
,I have a plan to walk her down the isle to get married
,How am I gonna plan to buy her a dress to be buried in?
,And I'm trying to keep it to Kevin
,Cause I'm the man,and I'm the...the man in the house
,And I'm the one he cry on when it's coming.
,And I'm trying to tell my wife,tell myself,Tony.
,I'm trying to beg the world,jus...jus...just give me chance
,Jus...jus...just give me chance,jus..jus..just let me take a breath
,Just stop just for a minute
,I want to call my parents...and tell them what do I do?
,I don't know what to do,I'm a grown man,and I don't know what to do.
,And a man,a voice in me comes up like...like they all from training day
,'Man up!Nigga!you think you're the only one losing kids today?
,25 kids walked in here with cancer and only 5 walking out!
,This ain't no sitcom,it don't wrap up all nights' entirely 30 minutes

,
,You do whatever you want to me
,Insult me, kick me, shit on me
,And the only thing I can do
,To get some fucking respect from you
,Is to hold a gun on you
,This is pathetic!
,And this is your fault!
,You thought I was weak.
,Weak, huh
,How weak am I now
,They teach us
,That man evolved from apes.
,I think that's wrong.
,I think man evolved from dogs!
,You know what happens when you kick a dog
,One too many times?

,You know? And it used to scare me so much
,That I didn't know what was coming in my life.
,You know, like, like I would always think
,Uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move?
,But maybe there isn't any right move.
,You know? I mean, look at us.

,We all watch the same TV.
,Nobody's really different
,Even if they think they're different.
,
,"Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"
,And see, that's what makes me freak.
,Because I can do anything I want
,As long as I don't care about the result
,Anything is possible
,It is night on planet earth
,And I'm alive
,And someday I'll be dead
,Someday I'll just be bones in a box
,But right now, I'm not
,And anything is possible
,
,Nothing ever changes, man
,Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead
,And there'll be new people standing here
,Drinking beer, eating pizza
,Bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos
,And they won't even know we were ever here
,And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust
,And bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers
,Trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet
,And they'll all be full of shit
,It's all so fucking futile
,
,I don't need money, man
,I don't even need a future.
,
,Every night I lie awake
,I can feel you walk inside my brain
,Can't expect a change to take
,Place inside my mind, you've earned to stay
,Every time you talk to me
,I feel like someone finally understands
,Never thought you'd fall for me,
,I never thought you'd give me one last chance
,Every time you talk to me
,I feel like someone finally understands
,Never thought you'd fall for me,

,Tell me what you want to know
,In the shotgun, lover, and I want it all

, I can see what I've become but
, Will it ever end the song inside my head?

, I wash up on shore, and listening to the wilds
, I can see what I've become but
, You said there was the time and the place
, To be honest, I just wanted the taste of your insignificance
, And other disbelief I spend to win a game
, Look at the dice I said it's time to go
, I don't see from but the answer's always close
, Don't complain that complicated wishes
, Is it even worth blowing kisses?

,Verse1：Aydo$
,城市里散播着讯号
,关于你我却找不到
,当天空聚集了飞鸟
,他们就在风雨中依靠
,你在寒夜里失眠
,盯着窗台期待着夏天
,汽车被雪埋在路边
,而我忽略了时间
,你爱的他已经走远你却更怀念从前
,你写的诗篇飘在了昨天
,你对镜子许下的诺言却像熊熊的火焰
,是你爬向明天的锁链
,你又一次熬到了五点 在你自己的房间
,告诉自己最后一次然后许愿
,把痛苦一次次修练，在你自己的空间
,有个人正在和你飞向零点
,城市里散播着讯号
,关于你我却找不到
,当天空聚集了飞鸟
,你在寒夜里失眠
,盯着窗台期待着夏天
,汽车被雪埋在路边
,而我忽略了时间
,Verse2:Noor-99
,看了眼手机上的时间 下次再也不能晚睡
,幻想着我能闯出片天 希望谁都不会反对
,和我兄弟从来没有胆怯 直视眼前的 山
,像树叶随风中摇曳 要挂最华丽的 帆
,为攀登生活中的高山 我买了新的登山服
,发誓要霸占山顶 要做一只下山虎
,规定的目标 我和兄弟伙 一起慢慢实现
,也有过错的 惹了祸的 大不了再来一遍
,人活着 不可能 每件事 像希望 中那样圆满
,发过誓 要做的 拼全力 就让它 陀螺般旋转
,我可能像你像他或她被生活一次次 打败
,但我知道你们也和我一样不想在 这里被淘汰
,抱怨的话题说太多会像祥林嫂
,少刷点微博吧因为明天要起早
,不想再被拉开距离 所以开启了疾跑
,但愿你们都能一样 一起为所有人祈祷

,陳：呢个係加勒比海嘅海盗嘅故事
,佢有一个相恋嘅情人
,只可惜個女仔係出生貴族
,所以佢哋根本冇可能可以喺埋一齐
,個一晚,係一个月色好靓嘅晚上
,于是個海盗决定要劫走佢最心愛嘅人
,上咗呢只海盗船上面
,从此一齊離開呢个地方
,張：我估个女仔應該系自願跟果男仔走嘅
,陳：唔同嘅人，睇法唔一样嘅
,張：系呢，既然果晚月色咁樣靚
,點呢幅畫裡面又唔畫埋上去嘅?
,陳：因為最靓嘅月色
,只有佢两个人在船上面
,先至會睇得到。
,——《東芝月色》
,張：離開書店嘅時候，
,我留低咗把遮
,希望拎咗佢返屋企果個
,係你啦
,——《這麼遠，那麼近》
,蘇：係我
,若果有多一張船飛
,你會唔會同我一齊走
,周：係我
,若果有多一張船飛
,你會唔會同我一齊走
,蘇：你想講乜啊
,我仲以為得我一個人知
,——《花樣年華》
,我記得佢條校服裙呢，
,永遠都係好乾淨嘅，
,燙得好直。
,戴著副好幼邊嘅金絲眼鏡，
,紮住對紅孖辮，
,皮膚好白好白，
,斯斯文文，
,講嘢好細聲。
,但係佢同你講嘢嗰陣時咧，
,佢啲口氣好似啲花香噉，
,吹埋你嗰度。
,每一次我企近佢身邊咧，
,我個心就會「噗噗噗噗噗噗噗」噉跳。
,成晚都瞓唔著，
,好開心。
,——《初戀》
,树林中有两条路
,而我选了那条较少人走的路
,这就造成了所有人的差异

,Love, love mmm...
,We would be the band to play it.
,My ghetto butterfly flew away from me.
,I wait patiently, by windows and doorsteps.Play, make believe, as my tears, poor chest,won't succeed to breathe, if not to hear of you.
,Surely there has never been a shade so blue. A stank attitude, so not mad at you.
,Not a magnitude to encompass the latitude of my love for you.
,No space and time compatible.
,What do I have to do? What do I have to do? Uh..my friends say I got it bad for you.
,I do. But there's nothing in this world I'd rather do, but you.
,I want to make love to your existence, drenched in colors of your energy, then ********** to the memories.
,I wanna lose myself inside yourself... Until you find me. Confine me,
,to the freedom of your prison.
,Exist in the same space, same time.
,Combine until your thoughts slow grind with mine.(x3)
,My, I wanna drink the sweat of your intellect,
,reflect, and watch your light passion walk my neck. Caress the sights of your presence with no question, undress to the nakedness of love, pure love.
,I want to make love to my soulmate... my soulmate... make love to my soulmate...my soulmate...
,make love to my soulmate, uh shit...
,I wonder, how does it feel to make love to your soulmate. Kind of like writing poetry till climax,
,till the point and place where space and time match.
,Can we cross the line, perhaps tell me would you like that. Now would you like that, tell me would you like that, would you like that, tell me would you like that,
,would you like that, tell me?
,I wanna love you more than madly.
,Wrap these legs around your words,
,until your speech is straddled deep, gladly. Swim the currents of your vibrations,
,be separate in one
,with the same meditation..
,Uh the same meditation..
,This is poetry.
,
,Ualy, play that saxophone right now!
,
,If love had a sound
,this would be that sound.
,And we would be the band to play it.

,With the ground uncovered, with the leaves all gone
,I can see your face and I know I was wrong
,When I left you there, I didn't know who I'd been
,So I waited for the rain to wash off all my sins
,Running through the forest when the leaves would fall
,Back then I didn't have you and I thought I had it all
,Back then you wouldn't touch me unless I was in pain
,Now you're gone forever and the memories replay
,All the bricks in the tunnel won't stop calling me back
,Just like every single letter always fades to black
,Cut my own skin breaking all the clocks for you
,Can't turn back time but I can see what I could do

,And going down with the sun
,Who's gonna believe you?
,One of these nights somebody's gonna leave you
,No one's gonna save you, save you
,Come the full moon
,who's coming to the rescue?
,What if tonight it's running, gonna get you？
,No one's gonna save you, save you
,When you cry wolf
,There's a knock at your door
,With the lights, with the lights out
,Turn the lock, hit the floor
,It's onto you, it's onto you
,Your tell-tale heart baby
,Beating like a drum
,Pounding out of your chest now

,It was a moment for the books.
,The calendar looked
,just like the novels we had only skimmed through.
,So I circled out the dates that I’ll skillfully waste.
,For now that’s going to have to do.
,
,It was the brightest summer day, after we swam in the lake,
,that you told me our luck is gonna end.
,So we better be concerned. We’re where the subway turns.
,We need a camera and some cash to spend.
,
,And our picturesque blame; we’ll put it in IKEA-frames.
,Up on the wall it looks profound,
,and reminds us Oslo is a small, small town. (Yeah)
,
,So it’s night and we dive into a basement that’s alive
,with stupidity that melts into pairs.
,But your good intent was clear when you split and left me here
,to regret I left my high horse upstairs.
,
,And with the way I say goodbye
,I could have ruined everything.
,But I’ll be seeing you around
,because Oslo is a small, small town.
,
,I’m keeping myself calm
,if just for the sake of staying warm.
,So with my eyes fixed on the ground
,Take me to the place
,I used to run
,Remember the house where I was born
,My baby you don't know me
,My baby you don't know
,
,I'll show you all the stars
,I used to hide
,No one ever seem to realize
,But baby you will know me
,But baby you will know
,
,But baby you will know
,But baby  you don't know
,
,But baby  you don't know

,
,
,
,Now I'm home, but I cannot stay
,
,I dream of you every day
,
,Got to know every inch of you
,
,Will you make my dream come true?
,
,There's no place like home they say
,
,You're my home, so hear me pray.
,
,I don't know you, but I need more time
,
,Promise me you'll be mine
,
,Birds are flying over Europe skies,
,
,Tell me please why can't I?
,
,Times have changed, but so have I
,
,I view my life through your eyes
,
,On the go in my tourist's shoes
,
,But I'll stay truthful to you
,
,Cause there's no place like home they say
,
,You're my home, so I guess I'll stay.
,
,I don't know you, but I need more time
,
,Promise me you'll be mine
,
,Birds are flying over Europe skies
,
,Tell me please why can't I?
,
,I don't know you, but I need more time
,
,Promise me you'll be mine
,
,Birds are flying over Europe skies
,Tell me please why can't I?
,
,The sun bleeds in hear the magpies sing
,For sorrow, it makes things better
,Maybe we get spread our wings tomorrow
,If luck will let us
,Can anyone fly into these gray skies
,Is there somewhere i'm meant to be
,Sea fog comes like a river rolls a stone
,it's rolling me
,I miss my turn in the dark i hear your voice
,It's makes things easy
,I stray to far from the road wish you
,Could always make things easy
,I wont fight through the rising tide
,If thats the way it has to be
,Sea fog comes like a river rolls a stone
,it's rolling me

,I'm just listening to the clock go ticking,
,lying waiting as the time goes by.
,I think of you with every breath I take,
,I need to feel your heartbeat next to mine.
,You're all I see, in everything.
,
,I just wanna hold you,
,I just wanna kiss you,
,I just wanna love you all my life.
,I normally wouldn't say this,
,but I just can't contain it.
,I want you here forever,
,right here by my side.
,
,All the fears you feel inside,
,and all the tears you cry,
,they're ending right here.
,I'll heal your heart and soul;
,I'll keep you *oh* so close.
,Don't worry; I'll never let you go.
,You're all I need, you're everything.
,
,I just wanna hold you,
,I just wanna kiss you,
,I just wanna love you all my life.
,I normally wouldn't say this,
,but I just can't contain it.
,I want you here forever,
,right here by my side.
,
,No one else will ever do.
,I got a stubborn heart for you.
,Call me crazy, but its true; I love you.
,I didn't think that it would be,

,And the moment will come when composure returns
,Put a face on the world, turn your back to the wall
,And you walk twenty yards with your head in the air
,Down the Liberty Hill, where the fashion brigade
,Look with curious eyes on your raggedy way
,And for once in your life you have nothing to say
,And could this be the time when somebody will come
,To say, "Look at yourself, you're not much use to anyone"
,Take a walk in the park, take a valium pill
,Read the letter you got from the memory girl
,But it takes more than this to make sense of the day
,Yeah it takes more than milk to get rid of the taste
,And you trusted to this, and you trusted to that
,And when you saw it all come, it was waving the flag
,Of the United States of Calamity, hey!
,After all that you've done boy, Im sure you're going to pay
,In the morning you come to the ladies salon
,To get all fitted out for The *****back Throne
,But the people are living far away from the place
,Where you wanted to help, it's a bit of a waste
,And the puzzle will last till somebody will say
,"There's a lot to be done while your head is still young"
,If you put down your pen, leave your worries behind
,Then the moment will come, and the memory will shine
,Now the trouble is over, everybody got paid
,Everybody is happy, they are glad that they came
,Then you go to the place where you've finally found
,You can look at yourself sleep the clock around
,sleep the clock around
,
,All the years that you have wasted
,Now you want 'em all back
,Long ago you stopped counting
,Because you couldn't keep track
,You were faced with a future
,That was bright as the Sun
,But the pressure, it was melting
,You decided to run
,Don't you fold
,When the mountain is high
,When the river is wide
,Don't you fold
,When you're out of your mind
,When you're walking the line
,An oasis in the desert
,Where the waters run clear
,And the only way to see it
,Is to believe that it's there
,Well, we always fight our battles
,No matter where you came
,So, be done with your excuses
,You're the only one to blame
,Don't you fold
,When the mountain is high
,When the river is wide
,Don't you fold
,When you're out of your mind
,When you're walking the line
,And all this time
,I was living a lie
,I was lost and petrified
,But I know that things
,Could change in time
,All the years dreams can buy
,Between the heart and the mind
,Don't you fold
,When the mountain is high
,When the river is wide
,Don't you fold
,When you're out of your mind
,When you're walking the line
,Don't you fold

,When the river is wide
,Don't you fold

,I still think of you
,On some cold winter's day
,I remember smiling
,Oceans away
,We heard the fireworks
,We heard our hearts beating fast
,The only thing we didn't hear
,Was how to make the dream last
,Do you even remember
,The things we used to say
,What is the love of dinosaur
,Has it fade away
,Away
,I can't resemble
,In the sorna(?) of fast？？？
,But it's only a memory
,A looking glass fall and cracks
,I don't know what's real anymore
,Everything's the same
,I've such a believing
,That my dreams remain
,I'll stand in the rain
,I'll ride on the trains
,I won't get on a plane
,I'll feel no pain
,No pain
,No pain

,小朋友 你是否有很多问号
,为什么 别人在念两句诗
,我却在练写字
,到最后失了智
,别人在下象棋
,我却在被服厂踩我的缝纫机
,我说我想要一门意大利炮
,却得到半斤劣质地瓜烧
,为什么要听政委的话
,长大后我就会开始懂了这句话
,长大后我开始明白
,为什么我
,跑得比别人快
,腰带比别人高
,将来大家讲的都是我搞的事情
,大家听的都是我饶的舌
,政委的辛苦不让你看见
,温柔的眼神却经常浮现
,有空就多陪他喝喝酒
,喝醉之后一起梦游
,听政委的话
,别让他受伤
,想快快长大
,才能保护他
,美丽的白牙
,幸福中责骂
,天使的魔法
,神圣的无暇
,在你的未来
,他们是你的王牌
,却被旅长一顿宰
,唉！旅长真他娘的坏
,还是听政委的话吧
,作战先通报吧
,我知道我所做的事
,旅长比我更无耻
,你会开始学孔二愣子给旅长端茶送水
,我建议最好说旅长我会遵守军规
,遵守军规 怎么会从我嘴巴说出
,旅长无赖 所以要叫你闷声发财
,政委交给你的歌曲你要好好的记着
,母亲节到的时候我要在B站唱给你们听着
,对了 我会遇到全明星
,所以我可以和战友炫耀
,姿势水平比你们高
,我找不到 那些年的战友
,那刻骨铭心的她
,暮去朝来花谢花开
,唯独你不败
,我会开始出道唱鬼畜歌
,而你将是我歌里唯一的主角
,听政委的话
,别让他受伤
,想快快长大
,才能保护他
,美丽的白牙
,幸福中责骂
,天使的魔法
,神圣的无暇
,听妈妈的话
,别让她受伤
,想快快长大
,才能保护她
,长大后我开始明白
,为什么我
,跑得比别人快
,腰带比别人高
,将来大家讲的都是我搞的事情
,大家听的都是我饶的舌

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ah, don’t look down
The party’s on
The spirit’s up
We’re here tonight
And that’s enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The children's choir sing their song

The children's choir sing their song
and everyone can sing along
The party’s on

,Flying and feeling the ceiling
,And barely dealing
,And the faintest, the faintest of praises
,Are too revealing
,Such a waste of a beautiful day
,Someone should say it
,Such a waste of the only impossible, logical way in
,A fly-in at LA was open
,I wasn't hoping for a win
,I was hoping for freedom
,You couldn't beat 'em
,So you crumbled, you doubled your dosage
,You wanna go, said the inhibitor blocking the passage
,That thing is massive
,And the sky will come for you once
,Just sit tight until it's done
,The sky will come for you once
,Just sit tight until it's done
,Got so hooked on a feeling
,I started dealing
,In a stage of grief so demanding
,I got a stand-in
,Every radio buzzing, it wasn't the dream of the moment
,Wasn't the current that carried me, keeping me going
,Only want to get to work
,But every morning I'm too sick to drive
,Suffering whiteout conditions
,Forget the mission, just get out alive
,Only want to glean the purpose
,Only to scratch the surface, raise the plow
,Suffering whiteout conditions
,Forget your mission, just get out somehow
,
,Everyone suddenly busy
,Suddenly dizzy
,You're so easy, it's pushing you over
,They're taking tours
,Of a treacherous trip of the badlands
,You have your demands
,Maybe you're right, but nothing is just a bad hand
,Only want to get to work
,But every morning I'm too sick to drive
,Suffering whiteout conditions
,Forget the mission, just get out alive
,Only want to glean the purpose
,Only to scratch the surface, raise the plow
,Suffering whiteout conditions
,Forget your mission, just get out somehow
,
,Finally flying the ceiling
,I see myself
,And the revival, it suddenly hits me
,It's going viral
,Such a waste of a beautiful day
,Someone should say it
,Such a waste of the only impossible, logical way in
,Got so hooked on a feeling
,I started dealing
,But the days spent kicking the cages
,Are too revealing
,So committed to your misfortune
,But still a cheater
,Such a waste of a beautiful day
,Wish you could be here

,When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
,When you look so good, baby, you don't even know
,When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing

,Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
,You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

,You're the best thing about me
,The best thing that ever happened a boy

,
,Why am I
,Why am I walking away?
,Why am I walking away?
,
,I'll be crying out, "How bad can a good time be?"
,Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
,I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
,There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall
,

,For all the times that you rained on my parade
,And all the clubs you get in using my name
,You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
,You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
,And I didn't wanna write a song
,Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
,I don't but, you still hit my phone up
,And baby I'll be movin' on
,And I think it should be somethin'
,That I don't wanna hold back
,Maybe you should know that
,My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
,And I never like to admit that I was wrong
,And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
,And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
,Cause if you like the way you look that much
,Oh baby you should go and love yourself
,And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
,You should go and love yourself
,But when you told me that you hated my friends
,The only problem was with you and not them
,And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
,And tried to make me forget where I came from
,And I didn't wanna write a song
,Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
,I don't but, you still hit my phone up
,And baby I'll be movin' on
,And I think it should be somethin'
,That I don't wanna hold back
,Maybe you should know that
,My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
,And I never like to admit that I was wrong
,And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
,And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
,Cause if you like the way you look that much
,Oh baby you should go and love yourself
,And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
,You should go and love yourself
,I'm so glad you made time to see me
,How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
,I haven't seen them in a while
,You've been good, busier than ever
,Small talk: work and the weather
,Your guard is up and I know why
,Because the last time you saw me will still
,burn in the back of your mind
,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
,
,So this is me swallowing my pride,
,standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you,
,wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
,I go back to December all the time
,
,
,These days I haven't been sleepin'
,Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
,And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
,I watched you laughin' from the passenger side and
,I realized I loved you in the fall
,Then the cold came, the dark days
,when fear crept into my mind
,You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
,
,So this is me swallowing my pride,
,standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December all the time
,It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you,
,wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December,
,turn around and change my own mind
,I go back to December all the time
,
,I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
,So good to me, so right
,And how you held me in your arms that September night
,The first time you ever saw me cry
,Maybe this is wishful thinking
,Probably mindless dreaming
,If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
,
,I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
,So if the chain is on your door, I understand
,
,This is me swallowing my pride,
,standin' in front of you, sayin' I'm sorry for that night
,And I go back to December
,It turns out freedom aint nothin' but missin' you,
,wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
,I go back to December, turn around and make it aright
,i go back to December turn around and change my own mind
,I go back to December all the time
,
,All the time
,
,
,I've been in a season
,Where the leaves are changing
,You're calling
,Like a whisper in the wind
,Taken by your glory
,I can't believe you know me
,With all my scars, you want this heart
,All I am
,And you, you're everywhere
,And you, you're always there
,Your peace is washing over me
,Your love has set me free
,Nothing can compare
,I'm found in the arms of your embrace
,Captured in this place
,You help me catch my breath
,In you I find my rest
,Take my life it's yours now
,On my knees I fall down
,Before my king, before your throne
,I am known
,Cause you, you're everywhere
,And you, you're always there
,Your peace is washing over me
,Your love has set me free
,Nothing can compare
,I'm found in the arms of your embrace
,Captured in this place
,You help me catch my breath
,In you I find my rest
,How beautiful to be
,Hiding under your wings
,I've never felt so safe before
,Cause your peace is washing over me
,Your love has set me free
,Nothing can compare
,I'm found in the arms of your embrace
,Captured in this place
,You help me catch my breath
,In you I find my rest
,In you I find my rest
,
,Look out of the window
,With all my heart
,But I'll find love in the same soul
,And fall apart
,Maybe we can be something new
,Are you ready for us?
,Cause I'm ready for you
,Are you ready for us?
,We can be something new
,Are you ready for us?
,Cause I'm ready for you
,Are you ready for us?
,To be something new
,We'll follow where the wind blows
,And see the heights
,Late walk just to let go
,Take in the sights
,Maybe we can be something new
,Are you ready for us?
,Cause I'm ready for you
,Are you ready for us?
,We can be something new
,Are you ready for us?
,Cause I'm ready for you
,Are you ready for us?
,To be something new
,In all honesty, we're slipping off slowly
,So hold on to me
,In all honesty, we're slipping off slowly
,So hold on to me
,We can be something
,Are you ready for us?
,Cause I'm ready for you
,Are you ready for us?

,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,I told the World one day I would pay it back
,say it on tape, and lay it, record it
,so that one day I could play it back
,but I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m saying that
,ya’ll starting to creep in, everyday it’s just so grey and black
,hope, I just need a ray of that
,cause no one see’s my vision when I play it for ‘em
,they just say it’s wack
,they don’t know what dope is
,and I don’t know if I was awake or asleep
,when I wrote this,
,all I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
,you picked me up, breeding life in me
,I owe my life to you
,before the life of me, I don’t see why you don’t see like I do
,but it just dawned on me you lost a son
,Demon's fighting you, it’s dark.
,let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
,I don’t think you realize what you mean to me
,not the slightest clue
,cause me and you were like a crew
,I was like your sidekick
,you gone either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
,or you go hug me

,I need a doctor,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,It hurts when I see you struggle
,you come to me with ideas
,you say there just pieces so I’m puzzled
,cause the shit I hear is crazy
,but your either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
,seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
,can’t make a decision you keep questioning yourself
,second guessing and it’s almost like your begging for my help
,like I’m your leader
,your supposed to fucking be my mentor
,I can endure no more,
,I demand you remember who you are
,it was YOU, who believed in me
,when everyone was telling you don’t sign me
,everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
,you risked your career for me
,I know it as well as you
,nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy
,Dre, I’m crying in this booth
,you saved my life, now maybe it’s my turn to save yours
,but I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
,but I ain’t giving up faith and you ain’t giving up on me
,get up Dre, I’m dying, I need you, come back for f-ck’s sake
,I’m about to lose my mind
,you’ve been gone for so long
,I’m running out of time
,I need a doctor
,call me a doctor
,I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life
,bring me back to life
,bring me back to life
,(I need a doctor, doctor
,to bring me back to life)
,It literally feels like a lifetime ago
,but I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
,you walked in, yellow jump suit
,whole room, cracked jokes
,once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
,went through friends, some of them I put on
,but they just left, they said they was riding to the death
,but where the f-ck are they now
,now that I need them, I don't see none of them
,all I see is Slim
,f-ck all you fair-weather friends
,all I need is him
,fucking backstabbers
,when the chips were down you just laughed at us
,now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots
,you go see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f-ck we been?
,you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
,little crack a jack beat making wack math,
,backwards producers, I'm back bastards
,one more CD and then I’m packing up my bags and as I’m leaving
,I’ll guarantee they scream Dre don’t leave us like that man cause…
,I’m about to lose my mind

,Iar e seara si nu esti acasa
,M-am saturat sa te astept
,Sa vii cu aceeasi scuza proasta
,Si sa te astepti ca eu sa iert
,Si tu stii ca nu e prima oara
,Dar sigur va fi ultima
,Eu sunt singura de asta seara
,Chiar daca doare
,E o, e ok
,Sa nu crezi ca nu pot trai fara tine
,E o, e ok
,N-am sa plang si n-o sa-mi para rau
,Am mesajele din telefon
,Pozele cu noi din dormitor
,Hainele aruncate pe covor
,Au ramas doar de decor
,Pozele in care ai zambit
,Clipele in care m-ai mintit
,Nu faceai decat sa joci un rol
,Totul a fost doar de decor
,De decor, de decor
,Cand nu mai vine de la sine, stii ca n-o sa mearga
,Nodul care l-ai facut acuma se desleaga
,Decorul se destrama, vreau sa uit si cum o cheama
,Dintr-o mie de mesaje, 900 sunt de pomana
,Am sters din telefon tot ce aveam, acum e gol
,Papa nu te lasa la mare, acum ai alt rol
,Ne certam si ne-mpacam, asa ne place noua
,Afara e soare tare, dar in casa parca ploua
,Si ma seaca tare lumea toata si apare
,Toata lumea-si da cu presupusul, altceva n-are
,Si cand suntem separati, noi suntem impreuna
,Eu, cand mint, spun adevarul, si asta e o minciuna

,Dis moi que si tu es là ce n'est pas juste pour mes jolis yeux
,Dis moi qu'au delà de ça y'a d'autres raisons qui te rendent heureux
,Dis moi si tu aimes biens bien nos paresses et nos matins d'amoureux
,Dis moi que c'est un début mais que tu vois déjà la suite à deux
,Dis moi que je suis la seule que tu n'aies jamais autant désirée
,Je n'ai pas de rendez vous, plus de rencard que j'ai envie d'accepter
,Avec toi c'est évident je suis prête à oublier mon passé
,J'ai toujours aimé charmer mais peu importe s'il n'y a qu'à toi que je plais
,Moi je me dis que c'est toi
,Et je sais que tu y crois
,Tu es celui qui rythme mes bonheurs
,Qui rythme mes humeurs
,Juste comme ça
,Et je me dis que c'est toi
,Et pour la toute première fois
,Pardonne moi mes doutes et mes colères
,Le temps fera l'affaire
,Et toi et moi
,Oh ça ira
,J'aime les airs assurés que tu empruntes aux plus beaux monuments
,Ton regard doux comme un secret tes caresses aux limites de l'indécent
,Tu comprends tous mes silences chacun de mes petits moments d'absence
,Si je vais au paradis j'suis pas sure de voir la différence
,Moi je me dis que c'est toi
,Et je sais que tu y crois
,Tu es celui qui rythme mes bonheurs
,Qui rythme mes humeurs

,Au pire on aura des souvenirs des jolis moments dans les tiroirs
,J'ai peur de ta gentillesse elle promet tant de bonheur
,Oh tu sais j'ai peur

,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Hey baby
,Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
,She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
,Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
,Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
,It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
,So baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,She was sippin’ on southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
,We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
,She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
,"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck"
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
,It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
,So baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,When that summer sun fell to its knees
,I looked at her and she looked at me
,And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
,Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
,I put it in park and
,Grabbed my guitar
,And strummed a couple chords
,And sang from the heart
,Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin’
,Hell I can’t get you out of my head
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
,Every little farm town with you
,Baby you a song
,You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
,Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle

,从吐字吐不清楚，说话也会结巴
,到能组织着音符，Hip-Hop 界的学霸
,把不可能，变成不，可能，我的路可能
,有点突兀，但我还是把这球投出得分
,松垮的裤带，这固执的书呆子
,步子迈得酷，开始，爱，那种态度
,踩着 Michael Jackson 的月球漫步拍子
,无奈的父母，在打探他的衣服牌子，
,节奏把他覆盖着像个布袋子
,从来不会感觉到被人羡慕，的孩子
,被人说他不行，说未来的路已塞死
,张着口在电视机前看着音乐录影带
,是，他，最爱的事，在那一刻开始
,他就想创造出全新的系统，就像比尔盖茨
,随便借了张纸，打开他的笔盒盖子
,燃烧的 Mic, but I just need the lighers
,打开他的电脑，把声音开的最高，在旁边开始尖叫，he's workin' let go
,拿着他的笔，随手下了一个 Beat，写着 "who I wanna be", let go

,我的 Rap Flow 像河水，而我喝咖啡像喝水
,只要我想我就能做，但碰巧我不想合嘴
,让我的对手想撤退，不然就让他躺车轨
,当他们在夜场喝醉，只想着被人抢着睡
,他选择，把他的 schedule 拍好，斜着带帽，
,写着快稿，夜色太好，能让灵感叠着来到，
,以前低估他的人，都列着排好接着拍照
,说一直以来都看好他，完全不觉得害臊
,街的拐角贴着海报，容易被忽略的外表
,10 年前，初学的菜鸟，10 年后，这列车开跑
,我想试着把年轻的 Rapper 带好，
,把坏习惯都戒了排掉，只管做你自己，别的还好
,怕自己见的太少，几年后，就变得太老
,穿了几遍的外套，我知道身体很重要
,但这几天，在我的字典里面没有睡觉
,想变成最好，it keep me awake now

,一起生活 有你感觉特别fun
,我要你给我的占有欲到天亮
,最美的地方带我去 oh baby
,清晨拉开窗帘天空渐渐放晴
,早起等待给我发的每条消息
,猜猜我会爱上怎样一个女孩
,她的品味怎么样穿的衣服大不大
,我想要抓着你的手吃遍市井烧烤
,喜欢搂着你的脖子回家和你洗澡
,用双手攀绕在你身体说点情话
,那种油腻的舒适感气氛不会尴尬
,总是想寻找机会把你一口吃掉
,总是在夜里对着手机呆呆傻笑
,听爵士乐的伴奏给你打通电话

,她优雅的脚步 嬉笑中带着腼腆
,棕色眼睛投射出夏天的灵魂
,寻找着保护 灯光下如此的显眼
,在第一次见面的凌晨
,大脑乱成一团 结结巴巴
,又跌跌撞撞的神志不清说我是她爹爹
,大大咧咧的坐在我的旁边
,问我什么时候可以把她带回房间
,遗忘了懵懂的概念
,已经不是青涩的爱恋
,和过去的女孩说再见
,高三时的女神现在变得浓妆艳抹
,受够了前女友的脾气叫上闺蜜骗我
,不会和她有个家 不会和她去买家具
,不会把她的手塞进口袋继续为她哈气
,我们的关系像玻璃 像top1的歌曲
,热情退却后把你的日记垫在桌底
,为什么莫名的说 和兄弟过情的喝
,我为了旁边的姑娘为她写首色请的歌
,既然有了旁边坐的女孩干嘛去找备胎
,和她喝完最后一杯酒把酒杯举到最嗨
,我要你给我的占有欲到天亮

,又想起你曾对我说的话
,分开时又曾挨了多少骂
,我也一直尝试坚持还是一直对你偏执那些日子里面为你打的架
,不知为什么一切成了空 你像是雪里抓不住的风
,微信里给你发的消息百里挑一伴你朝夕在我脑海里面不停发着嗡
,我在记忆里每天不停寻找 我开始懂得何为岁月陈好
,每天幻想着你的身体却找不到你的身影一个人去你最爱的群岛
,这感觉就好像是陷入泥塘 可我却演变成了踏故习常
,寂寞它让我猝不及防在这圈子里面迷茫挥之不去的是你的皮囊
,你在我思绪里面神出鬼入 不知不觉间就能扰乱我的纬度
,那时你经常说我幼稚生活让我丧失斗志到现在我才突然悔悟
,可我已寻觅不到你的踪迹 思念它像一把刀一样锋利
,脑海里两个我在争议像是蜜蜂丢了蜂蜜房间里消失不见的空气
,Baby i love U u know 在每一秒钟 I love U u know 还想牵你的手
,淋雨一起走 要这不是梦 陪你到最后 永远都不回头
,Baby i love U u know 在每一秒钟 I love U u know 还想牵你的手
,和你淋雨一起走 要这不是梦 陪你到最后 永远都不回头
,我想起我曾跟你探讨到底什么才是恋爱 想和你永远都能一起保持现在
,时常和你争吵对你声讨 到头来发现感情是我欠债
,还想你能够回到我的身旁 想把你珍藏 不去浪漫的土耳其更不去敦煌
,我只想带你回到那天夏天 回到那天 想和你拥抱在无人的大街
,在萧条的夜里带着高潮的液体 你就像行走的春药让我根本不能自已
,在那个安静的凌晨两个干净的灵魂 把你拥入怀中就是对我操劳的谢礼
,我愿意为你甩掉我的那些坏习惯 陪你在身旁让你感受我的爱弥漫
,把你放在我的朋友圈然后等有天 做个炫妻狂魔那种感觉太奇幻
,Baby i love U u know 在每一秒钟 I love U u know 还想牵你的手
,淋雨一起走 要这不是梦 陪你到最后 永远都不回头

,Hey girl 每当你眯着眼对我笑
,全世界都融化在你的眼角
,为何你的脸总是在我脑海萦绕
,突然发现原来我早就已经悄悄爱上你
,（verse1：松格森）
,你的出现像交通灯 指挥我停止行驶
,像士兵服从长官 绝对令行禁止
,这是命运注定 在爱情里服刑
,这感觉说不清 捉摸不定 我却更加笃定
,baby 你的笑容美得让人醉
,wait me 你总是有一堆的男人追
,don't hate me 我们都应该给对的人机会
,你像病毒黑进我体内 我的内心没准备
,每个早上都想象 能和你相遇在小巷里
,如果麻烦找上你 我一定会奋不顾身跑向你
,提前替你解决掉问题 让一切变得稳妥
,你是我的主公 我是守护你的忍者
,如果你需要的话可以拿走我所有的东西
,但请别拿走你的微笑 它对我就像是空气
,像夏天里的甘霖 把我心灵洗涤干净
,我愿为你爱上这个世界从现在开始running

,周围的一切都变成了背景
,想去跟哆啦A梦学会飞行
,带领你环游世界看遍所有的美景
,你走进教室说声老师早
,怎么最近有点瘦了 我知道考试好辛苦
,但还想提醒你早餐一定要吃饱
,为了你我要努力变好不能做个小赤佬
,每次当你走过来 我就心跳加速
,想要向你表白 却被你盯到发怵
,为什么我这么的害羞
,这么的没用
,这样下去怎么可能追到你
,当我看到你就像看到天空在微笑
,怎么唱起欧若拉 我知道那是你曾经最喜欢的歌
,想在你耳边诉说
,我有多爱你
,想骑车载你 坐在一起看
,着远方天空落大雨
,Hey girl 每当你眯着眼对我笑

,我脑海中的风景 都关于你
,看着你和别人聊天假装不在意
,baby you know you know you know
,如果可以 那我要定居在你的心里
,你出现在我的世界 我为你遮风挡雨
,思念穿过了日夜 不只是三言两语
,总担心自己不够努力 担心配不上你
,是你让我 对别的异性都产生抗体
,陪你去吹着海风 渴了帮你拧瓶盖
,走遍你想去的地方爱都装满旅行袋
,都说在你有困难的时候我都会在
,但总嫌自己关键时候出现的不够快
,那就呆在你身边 陪你过每个冬天
,答应陪你走的路都没有终点
,对你的爱在心间 每天 都保持新鲜
,为你比个爱心再给它镀上金边

,把忤逆带进学校
,逃学我找到诀窍
,警察把我找到
,妈妈哭着说我还年少
,那是我觉得所有人都跟我作 对
,我在我自己的世界尽情的落 坠
,离家出走的我那时还是未满十五
,我打架抢 劫成为了全家人的耻辱
,我讨厌约束 讨厌被禁锢
,用最极端的方法让伤害过我的人记 住
,你是否有时觉得
,命运它对你不公
,但有时又会学着
,在沉重里找轻松
,我仰望星空 把过去冰封
,我发誓 绝不会像 他们一样 过得那么平庸

,你我都一样想永远名留青史
,从小我就知道脚要踩地天在头顶
,佛在上方俯瞰众生 就像蝼蚁
,不用害怕 黑暗战胜不了光
,你 保持真实就会 得到爱的表彰
,我想要什么我会通过努力独立去争
,不是像个孩子在我身后狂喷
,想要梦想的路永远亮着绿灯
,就算跪着也要朝着目标狂奔
,我才不管 你有什么看法
,当我需要精神救赎 你又在哪
,太多必要交际 在不停交替

,过的过了 算的算了
,看谁不爽 就把谁办了
,所以我干了这杯酒
,从夏天的头，醉到了最后
,
,Don't let it be a sad, sad song
,Baby tell me something I don't wanna hear
,Come say you need me, turn around and disappear
,Come take me deeper, kick my heart and make my soul
,Come say you love me, turn around and let me go
,Like a knife do it right, cut me deep cut me slow
,All my life, you would try but you'll never know
,Am I a masochist to let them in each time
,What don't kill you makes you stronger, I know I'll be fine
,Better than the last time
,Oooh, oooh
,Motivating
,Yeeeeaaaaaaaah
,Hit me with your best shot(best shot)
,Trust, I can take it (i can take it)
,Exactly, yeaaah
,Yeah, I'm staying focused like a camera lens
,I beat the game up, somebody call an ambulence
,I eat the fame up -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner, bitch
,Hungry like orphanage, tell me, I don't give a shit
,Run it, yup I'm killin' it
,and this is the massacre
,Sittin' on a shotgun, but I'm no passenger
,
,
,It's like every day's Christmas
,On my Saint Nick shit, scratchin' up my wishlist
,Fresh kicks, racks on racks on riches, my misses
,Sprout it like a title fight, can I get a witness
,Raise your gloves up, and throw your noose out
,And keep your guard up, or life will know your tooth out
,Cuz' it's a cold world, homie, but I'm loose out
,I hear em calling for me, howling was loose out
,
,And when they told me that I'll never be
,All that I dreamed of, baby I still believe
,Ooohh, nothing can break me, or they'll take me
,I'm a dreamer, and baby dreams will come true
,When you believe, when you sing
,Because it's happening to me
,It's happening to me
,Ooooohhh
,Trust that I can take it (take it)
,Hand and knees are shaking(shaking)
,Dreams are meant for chasin'(chasin')
,Nothings gonna break me
,Trials and tribulations testing(testing)
,See em as a blessing(blessing)
,Harder push me harder, I grow stronger hear them calling
,and you can watch me(yes you can)
,BUT YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
,Nah, cuz’ I ain't slowing down for nothing
,The power's inside, so I'm blowing up - Combustion
,My pens blowing, the inks bleeding, the paper soaks it
,And I read it, recite it, and ya'll feel it
,Because I've been practicing writing for 12 seasons
,Jesus, I'm working towards the dreams that I believe in
,I'm sorry mama I'm a goner, straight leaving
,Shooting for the stars, and they callin' , I can hear it
,
,Much love to Japan, dreams come true baby
,
,GOON TRAX（
,
,And when you told me that I'd never be
,All that I dreamed of, baby I still believe
,And baby dreams will come true
,When you believe
,
,All that I dreamed of, baby I still believe
,When you believe, and you'll see
,
,It's happening to me
,We get it on most every night
,when that moon is big and bright
,its a supernatural delight
,everybody's dancing in the moonlight
,everybody here is out of sight
,they dont bark and they dont bite

,
,I've seen you change a lot you seen me grow up
,From when my flow sucked threw shows but no one showed up
,And so what you still had my back through the rain
,It's crazy when I think about the change insane and lately
,They show me love so when I spit I represent you
,The 2-0 through gowe 6'ing instrumentals
,Killing any beat in itself I'm speaking
,Myself so when the heat peeks I'm keeping it seeking for help
,You light my eyes up when the night falls
,So I slow down on I-5 to get a better picture
,You're so pretty
,I could leave but I would miss ya
,And to breathe in the sea is where the air is never crisper
,I've seen people leave but I'm a stand right here
,So if the spotlight shines
,You're gonna be right there
,But tell me if I had no rhythm or flow
,Would you still have a place in the city for gowe
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I had a passion to write the pen was glued to my hand
,When I was writing these poems they were forming a band
,Alone did I stand my dreams still intact all the times
,I was smacked for even mentioning rap
,Now my folks love it and they just came to a show
,They don't catch all of the words but they applaud for gowe
,And as a son, that brings a big smile to my face
,So When I'm done
,I'll leave the bright lights of the stage and recline
,Reminisce on the times like my first battle At the Nippon kan theatre
,I lost that one Or my first out of state gig
,And the crowd was small
,Or the time we didn't have a stage at terry hall
,But we still rocked it
,and it's for the love of the art
,And a rest in peace goes out to the dearly depart
,So I bump biggie smalls one of the best emcees
,While I zone out at my spot as I reflect on me
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me? Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,I used to sit at this bench and just write rhymes
,So I could see the city lights and memorize the skylines
,So when I closed my eyes
,I would see without seeing you
,It was beautiful the nights were so colorful
,And now that I've grown up I return to the spot
,And take a seat on this bench you got me thinking a lot
,About the past and the present and Whether not I was destined
,Or is it really a question will I compromise in my message?
,Never, you also told me that my rhymes were too hard
,That it was a bit complex and so I took it to heart
,Now my parts are more friendly extending my hand
,Not as abstract as then so we can both understand
,See you relate to my words cause I experience you
,Not to mention we been close since the days of my youth
,So regardless of where I flew or might travel around
,Where there's gowe there'll also be Seattle my town
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't paint a picture with my words,
,Or bring you bright lights with a stage
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?
,If I couldn't fly around to all the different towns
,And represent you with my sound
,Would you still love me?
,Would you still love me?

,Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this
,I always thought it would only be one kiss
,One became a honey
,Oh, all of a sudden, I'm saying, "I love you"
,Plot twist, everything's happening so quick
,I only wanted a taste of your lips
,Lips became your body, nights turning to naughty
,You hit me with a plot twist
,Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy
,I might drive fast, but don't slow dance
,I fuck all night, I don't really fuck with romance
,I might be hands on, but I never hold hands
,Since you came into my world
,I had to leave that in the past tense
,Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy
,All my life I've been a player, player, player
,But I don't wanna play no more
,I guess that's the effect you got on me
,Somebody better say a prayer, prayer, prayer
,For the one I was before
,I guess that's the effect you got on me
,Chorus: Marc E. Bassy

,Verse 2: KYLE
,Don't know what it was, don't know what it was
,Baby, turn me up, baby, turn me up
,It was only one night, I was in and out
,How the fuck I fall in love? How I fall in love?
,Yeah, she got inside
,She built a brand new house in my mind
,And damn, she already close with my moms
,I couldn't even kick her out if I tried
,Oh, I had it figured out
,How'd she shoot me down?
,Now she's moving in
,Ah, shit

,See, I've never been in love
,But I've never been opposed to it
,I never really thought I'd ever get this close to it
,Where do we take a chance?
,You wanna make a go for it
,'Cause now you come into my world
,I'll chase you 'round the globe for it
,Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy

,Summer Is Over
,新浪微博 @harry鲍
,Autumn never seemed this cold before
,Here I am sleeping on the floor
,We changed just like the leaves
,Outside my house
,And my phone lay silent by the couch
,
,I remember June
,Back when I met you
,And your eyes were green
,And we were, too
,
,But summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,And we knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye to the lovers
,'Cause summer is over
,
,I can still see your silhouette
,In the white hot sand
,Still feel my ring on your hand
,The clock was always ticking down
,Behind that glass
,Singing “love, be good while you last”
,
,But we both knew
,What we were getting into
,The things we said
,Sounded true
,
,But summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,And we knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss
,goodbye to the lovers
,’Cause summer is over
,
,The distant innocence
,We are leaving far behind
,Your last words will be burning in my mind
,In the winter time
,
,Well summer is over
,We were tangled in the morning sun
,Felt you getting colder
,I knew that we would come undone
,And it’s back to my town
,back to your life
,Gray skies are blowing a kiss goodbye
,goodbye

,You got a way of making me feel insane
,Like I can't trust my own brain
,Unless it's screaming your name
,I'd have it no other way
,I'd have it no other way
,And maybe that's why I stay
,How many times can we pick up the same fight?
,Can we keep screaming all night?
,And make up until it's light?
,That's when I say that you're right
,And feel your body on mine
,Oh, maybe that's why I stay
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,Keep coming back
,Guess you can say I'm attached
,Last time we called it a wrap
,I came begging and all that
,You're like a habit, it's bad
,I gotta have it, it's bad
,Oh no, I'm not even mad, no
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,It's the way you keep me up all night
,It's the way you make me lose my mind
,Every time I'm saying one more night
,It's the way you know I'm yours
,It's the way you know I'm yours for life
,I could be somewhere, chilling on a beach
,I could be with someone, making me happy
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,I could put my phone down
,Just pick up my keys
,I could let you go and we could let it be
,But that would be too easy, love
,And I don't want no easy love
,
, We can take an Uber to the beach, babe
, Got a little seasick riding the waves
, Maybe take a trip up the mountains
, Get a little fresh air, eyeing the trees
,
, But pardon me, I know I'm being forward
, Really want you to be my lover
, 'Cause I cannot hide it and
, I don't wanna fight it anymore
,
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, 'Cause you come and you go and
, You never let me know when you come back
, I love it when you're here, here, here
, So won't you stay here?
,
, We can make a movie in the desert
, Nothing but your T-shirt on, on
, We can chase the Sun up on his elbow
, Watching all the clouds go by, go by
,
, But pardon me, I know I'm being forward
, (I'm being forward, baby)
, Really want you to be my lover(really want to)
, 'Cause I cannot hide it and
, I don't wanna fight it anymore
,

, I love it when you're here, here, here
, 'Cause you come and you go and
, You never let me know when you come back
, I love it when you're here, here, here

,cut you off the assembly line and in catalogs and still strongly
,pursued on the market like online dating
,servicing billion of records that are waiting to be slapped on
,and the needle to be played and be scratched on
,like all digi everything you gotta be kidding me, right
,how can they replace thee?

岚の中で辉いて　その梦をあきらめないで
伤ついた　あなたの背中の
天使の羽　そっと抱いて　抱いてあげたい
苍く果てない宇宙(そら)の片隅で
生まれた梦が　今小さくても
あなたの瞳に映る明日を
谁よりそばで　信じていたい
冻りつくような　强い风でさえ
その胸に辉く　梦を消したり
そうよ　消したりなんて出来ない
岚の中で辉いて　その梦をあきらめないで
伤ついた　あなたの背中の
天使の羽　そっと抱いて　抱いてあげたい
转载来自

伤つくたびに　孤独を抱いても
あふれる泪　勇气に变えて
户惑うことを　けして怖れずに
未来のドアを　その手で开けて
あなたの话す　梦が好きだから
まだ远い明日も　きっと迷わず
そうよ　迷わず越えてゆけるの
岚の中で辉いて　いつだってみつめているよ
伤ついた　あなたの两手で
明日がほら　生まれてゆく　辉いてゆく
岚の中で辉いて　その梦をあきらめないで
伤ついた　あなたの背中の
天使の羽　そっと抱いて　抱いてあげたい

,Anti-Flag The Press Corpse Lyrics
,The (Downing Street) memo says...
,...We gotta work to make the facts fit
,the false charges
,Pull the wool over the eyes of
,the filthy masses
,Stab the people in the back for
,the corporate choice
,Roll the propaganda out using
,The People's Voice
,We don't want to talk about it...
,The press scribble scribble
,every half-truth spoke
,Then shoot it round the country
,like an April Fools joke
,Hype the nation
,for a Desert Storm love affair
,Wave the stars and stripes
,like you just don't care!
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,And on the TV screen...
,...Diversion and aversion
,is the flavor of the day
,Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
,Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
,The White House Press Corpse
,only has one thing to say...
,"We don't want to talk about it!"
,The White House boils over
,"Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
,The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing
,the White House song
,While over in Iraq thousands
,are dead because of lies
,The spineless war
,drumming-press corpse have taken lives
,They talk it up all day
,talk it up all night
,Talk until their face turns
,blue - Red white and blue!
,But when the truth escapes
,the night and crawls into the day
,We find the picture still askew
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute
,hoho
,
,Fires fueled on endless lies
,Black shrouds coat desert skies
,A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
,As embeds report what they're fed
,
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,We don't want to talk about it
,the night and crawls into the day
,They don't want to...
,talk talk talk talk talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
,wowo
,They don't want to talk about it
,They want tiptoe, walk around it
,Wave the flag and cowardly salute

,当死亡将要来临
,如果距离死亡还差一周
,我会给你露上一手
,比如说穿着拖鞋
,在大礼堂里大声呼救
,和所有金属乐迷
,一起mosh或是pogo甩头
,我不敢保证自己
,死墙的时候兜里不会踹着砖头
,掰碎每张我觉得烂成稀屎的专辑
,冲进音像店里管你是
,英语韩语还是繁体
,再给自己拍个个人传记
,风格有点像八英里
,转头打开ps4
,通关我刚买的龙珠Z
,如果可以的话我
,还想报名参加UFC
,唉还是算了吧
,能多活几日就多活几日
,哪怕我的心脏已经快烂了
,反正也没有急事
,老实说我没考驾照
,但我偏要飙车在每个集市
,打给每个前女友
,破骂一顿结尾句加peace
,屈臣氏的导购
,要是和我比比
,我就踢爆他的鼻子
,解散活死人
,然后给每个成员出首diss
,突然眼前一黑 倒了下去
,如果死亡将要来临
,我到底该如何？
,是悲观在家等死
,还是出门扑克？
,如果死亡将来临
,我到底该如何？
,我想被别人记住
,哪怕是个loser！
,给自己留个遗嘱
,为了捉弄那个律师比如
,在信封里夹只
,干瘪的壁虎
,如果脸颊有眼泪流下
,就开玩笑说
,“这是大小便失禁的屁股”
,在病床努力起身
,拥抱那两个
,正在假笑的父母
,跟夹杂白发的爸爸
,道歉在青春期
,不尊重他的错误
,想说句妈妈我爱你
,怎么眼角也变的模糊
,Bullshit 我还有很多事没做
,我得跟XX好好打一架
,然后再假装认个错
,我这臭脾气让我
,失去了太多
,再给几秒拜托
,我还要说
,告诉我你是不是
,真的爱过我
,我在问你
,别假装不知道
,你知道我说的就是你
,这辈子只有你一个
,可以让我爱你爱到窒息
,....
,看我现在这样子
,X 我的大限将至
,对了
,我走了记得给我烧
,那堆放粉丝明信片的箱子
,作为回报我会先替你
,去看看梦芸如今的样子
,如果死亡将要来临
,我到底该如何？
,是悲观在家等死
,还是出门扑克？
,如果死亡将来临
,我到底该如何？
,我想被别人记住
,哪怕是个loser！
,黑不见底的黑不见底的黑色
,黑不见底的黑不见底的黑色
,我在梦里还是黑洞里飞着
,黑不见底的黑不见底的黑色
,黑不见底也见底了黑色
,有束白光在黑不见底闪着
,白色闪烁在白色间隙里闪着
,白色见底是白色天使在站着

,呃...什么
,你刚说什么
,我的注意力分散没有听清你刚说什么
,我的视线有点模糊
,有点看不清楚
,我觉得这种情况下的我们不用说很多
,可能只是需要放部电影 或者听首歌
,wut? 你问我每次dota都会听什么
,rastafaria 或者wutever
,但是拒绝太吵闹或者太恶心的口水歌
,可是我自己唱了这么多的口水歌
,至少一两首我相信你也曾听过
,如果你曾几何时也有一丝被打动
,打动什么?感动什么?
,是不是曾经给你一个梦啊…

,我拿手柄 在肆意的电视机里蹂躏
,每一次幸运的进球都是因为寂寞投进

,有不少漂亮的小姐姐会光顾我家门口
,虽然我们都很陌生 但是会有愉快的感受
,在黑暗中从不开灯 因为光线从不管用

,善良的内心和邪恶的外表快乐是唯一企图
,穿越爱丽丝梦游仙境 找寻最喜欢的人物
,把它带到你身边让你把所有的心事全部倾诉
,夏天穿可爱的短裙 带你买喜欢的宠物
,不要轻易动了感情 你的眼泪总是反复
,听说你看个电影都能哭上一个中午
,而剧情却只是猎人开枪打死一只松鼠
,为什么如此可爱 像只粉红色的精灵
,每次离开都带着冰淇淋般融化的心情

,ayo 好久不见 想了解你现在过得怎么样
, 你能否再次出现 在一次给我关心和体谅 
,自从你走了以后其实我过得也不怎么样 
,你觉得我过得很好 可没有你我又怎么能放得下 
,你说那就算了 我们的爱已经走到了尽头 
,我该怎么办呢 我会满足你一切一切的要求
,你的温柔 不再有 你说要走 不回首 
,我还爱你但却没法再一次的说出口
,我们的爱情像是一场游戏 怪我没有能力 
,把我双眼蒙蔽 再也找不到一个人来代替
,陌生的你在哪里 我爱你 
,曾经对你的未来幻想其实都tm的是在骗自己
,Ok所以现在的我终于彻底明白 
,其实爱里包含的多是痛不欲生的无奈 思绪澎湃
,当我回过神来发现其实她已不在
,那么现在我也不会为了爱而在去等待

,Dx45:
,不知道从哪里开始说起 至少现在还在想你
,就像在三年之前 我们从星巴克里聊起
,一天一天都在那里 
,故事也许就在那里 慢慢走起 和你一起 
,一起走过许多春夏秋冬 
,我们走过的路其实也不算是普通 
,但我现在心里空空 脑袋懵懵
,想再体验一次心跳砰砰 头脑空空 
,好想再和你 重新认识 
,就从你叫什么开始 
,我们堪称完美星座匹配 
,到最后 爱是那么憔悴 爱到支离破碎
,爱的过程都会成为你的阅历－我那么努力 努力对别人说那是经历 
,她会过去 我会忘记
,三年其实不是那么容易 也曾经想过放弃

,我们依旧不在一起 不能去打扰你 我知道你很好很优秀 我也在改变 变成你喜欢的模样 
,只是不知道何时还会与你面 
,但是以后的日子我只想有你 抛下一切和你在一起
,多希望这只是场噩梦 梦醒了便能带过一切
,有你在我才能安心


,现在的我真的很想忘记 试图放弃
,你的小情趣 小淫欲 還有你的那些小情绪
,但对你 我重来都没有发过脾气
,或许是因为你觉得我tm太爱游戏 
,还会记得那个夏季 烤肉吃一百次都不会腻 
,我会永远把你当作我的唯一
,再说爱你万遍都不会嫌弃
,可最后 还是把我抛弃 离我而去 
,安静的夜里 何曾你才能再一次的把我想起
,我再也不会存在于你心里 
,或许是你早已把我忘记 把我放弃 就当我们承诺都他妈是放屁
,现在每天都很晚睡 每天都在买醉 就想在深夜里自己喝到烂醉
,这种感觉或许是你无法体会 
,所以别在为过去的事而感到身心疲惫

,听 这声音来自最熟悉的人
,心 没错走进了塔城的大门
,这里热情和空气都保持着最纯
,没有太装的人无时无刻跟你讲英文
,不用去吹 我哥们都是满腹经纶
,没有暴乱也没上过那坏的新闻
,看家乡被人诋毁我也感觉心疼
,所以想通过一首来描绘我的塔城
,这城市它不大 同样它也不差
,出生在这感觉这就是我的福啊
,这城市有许多不一样民族
,不同的宗教当然会有不一样的信徒
,不同的职业所以会有不一样的辛苦
,但我们都是塔城人都一样过的幸福
,每个人都想要自己有更好的生活
,所以为了自己也为这座城市而拼搏
,我想把它做我的给爸和妈
,感谢他们让我出生在这有个家
,如今的我17岁我早就已经长大
,童年的往事也在这里面生了根发了芽
,故事里的他还没有发生大的改变
,最起码他依然屹立在我的眼前
,我爱他的每个夜晚爱他的每个清晨
,我爱他的每个大街爱陌生的行人
,有些人问我为什么生活在这里
,我说家乡是不可能选择去放弃
,我想我可以 活得比你们得体
,因为 因为 因为 This My City
,我懂得这个城市每次流泪的滋味
,也体会的到这个城市每次给我的机会
,现在才发现和他相处是多么的珍贵
,这些年成长我改变了我自己的模样
,但唯一没改变的就是塔城在我心中的重量
,0901占据了我的半个心脏
,他是我的信仰他我的臂膀他教我如何去变得坚强
,他融入我的血液里面一直在流淌
,我对这里有太多回忆和太多构想
,现在特别想回到曾经战斗的球场
,但那里已经拆了盖起一栋栋的楼房
,我喜欢每次晚饭后街边的一次邂逅
,我爱这个城市不紧不慢的节奏
,我习惯每次伤心都看看这的天空
,你知道我爱这个城市但我不知道如何歌颂
,有些人问我为什么生活在这里
,我说家乡是不可能选择去放弃
,我想我可以 活得比你们得体
,因为 因为 因为 This My City
,时间还能继续 给塔城新的机遇
,有些人为了利益而把这座城市离去
,塔城hiphop让我走着这条道路很崎岖
,我只为有一天能让全国的目光在这聚集
,但我希望它以后能够一直普通
,就像是文化广场大妈能够一直舞动
,再过个几百年还会有这样蓝的天空
,我愿为这座城市做一个挡死的先锋

,昧着良心做的事江湖终会有人偿命
,要感谢擂台下的商人吹捧迎来全新

,切莫以身犯险 说唱圈图穷匕见
,江湖的争端 攻占江山 切磋也难免常见
,如若因此而产生看法 先收起自我的偏见
,小心刀剑无眼不给你好看 趁早滚蛋！

,爱恨情仇难判断 阻碍被我干翻
,生死有命 江湖儿女情长已被我看淡
,路上泛滥着要阻挠你路途的恶鬼
,待我踏平险阻 再与你共同跋山涉水
,With My bro My team My crew
,一步一步 这路的故事不停被我们续写
,江湖险恶 人心难测 暗箭难防
,射来多少的暗箭带着毒也带着对我的曲解
,君子之交淡如水 对我好的我都会记得
,这世道一直在变化着关系被践踏的虚伪的分久必合
,真真假假 亦假亦真 真假虚实 难以区分

,他也是上帝的孩子吗
,我怎麽想要把他换掉 脱罪以后表情依然的自然
,以他的智商 可以逃过这世上 所有的罪不够让他受 就算全身是伤
,试图脱罪的人 蒙羞祖先的魂 在挖掘魔鬼的坟 以为能灌醉了神

,主 请祢让他 对天微笑 感受 祢的仁慈
,让他的心可以重头 像是溪流清澈的源头
,其实他 并没有错 只是被人怂恿
,他的心有太多恨 不愿意尝试了解就先下定论
,受够了这些鸟事 不想被笑笨
,他只想要相信人 但是遇到的都是好人 那也不见得
,就算站在悬崖边 有绳子不愿抓
,昧著良心讲话 好话也不愿夸
,他们不是帮派 但是捨不得拿下真面具
,唯有武装自己才能得人尊敬不变的定律
,他不想被取笑 总是被人比较
,他只能树立敌人才显得没乱阵脚

,渐渐 的我也开始没了朋友
,被当作异类的人呐 也或许不只是我
,我讨厌现在的规则 想回到小时候
,没有察言和观色 情绪也没隐藏过
,可是时过境迁 只能走走走走
,在风中颤抖的手 又又是一年后
,没了命的拼凑 就即使关了聚光灯
,就算无法双脚落地 也仍想看黄昏
,我始终无法适应 只能够活在想象中
,你可以看看我的日记 但每一篇都是空
,Ice Paper（HOOK）：
,It's killing me inside
,Maybe
,还有谁在意你是否感同身受
,你不高兴什么
,你又忘记了什么
,说不完的故事总被冷落

,那些粉碎的坚贞 没有人来验证
,为了我永远回不去的天生
,你被环境同化了 你的个性融化了
,你自己的昨天也变成了一个黑色童话了
,宏大的想法全都被打碎了
,你也是娇生惯养的孩子爸妈从小哄大的
,你终于变得不再谈论理想
,因为今天你变得跟所有人一样
,为自己想 只为人民币想
,你要亲手杀死昨天的年少轻狂
,开始了变脏也开始了变胖
,白衣少年变得人模狗样一切开始走样
,昨天的坚强和今天的牵强
,你最鄙视的现象现在做得毫不勉强
,你曾经嘲笑这平凡的世界
,直到一天醒来你融入入这平庸的一切
,那么和谐又那么苟且那么狗血
,你竟然成了差不多先生
,想杀死差不多先生 为了我远去的天真
,那些粉碎的坚贞 没有人来验证
,为了我永远回不去的天生
,再见 所有的义薄云天
,再见 脑海里金色的明天
,再见 所有的好奇和新鲜
,再见 你从理想国回到人间
,开始习惯说假话开始圆滑
,忘掉你曾经说过的每句大话
,忘掉昨天的那一句 I don’t give a fuck
,开始做人 你成了差不多先生
,但我依然做不到别人嘴里所谓的成熟
,但我依然执着于自己的那点胜负
,有些东西注定要用一生来追逐
,除了自己没有谁能把EB挡住
,就算罔顾自己立下的每句誓言
,被网住 的天真少年开始陷入恍惚
,这脚步 变得犹豫变得不由自主
,但我讲述 的是每一个人的成长
,我们来到世间空着双手一无所有
,我不怕失败只怕自己不曾伸出双手
,掐住命运女神的脖子我不要活得像条狗
,放手 让我杀死差不多先生
,我杀死差不多先生 为了我远去的天真
,那些粉碎的坚贞 我们一起见证
,为了我永远回不去的天生
,我杀死差不多先生！

,这每一年 每一个 每一天 每一刻 每个人都不停的寻找的自己的另外一半
,他们对自己的病态习惯 生活糜烂 如果只能够留下遗憾 那么我不如不要和你这场胡闹
,这剧情太过于俗套 你的爱就像是慢性毒药 不知不觉中一天一天一点一点的把我除掉
,你是脱了缰的野马 可惜我没有草原 朋友劝我可别傻她的笑真的好甜
,虽然我们不够般配 我大了你足足三岁
,我还记得你父母特别干脆的问我 你来自哪个单位
,我知道那一秒种你的心里也不太好过
,纸里包不住火 地下恋情被挑破
,如果这是一场梦 请不要把我叫醒
,优柔寡断的我只能够 看着你倒影
,i feel my pain 你知道的 我总是不善言表
,我已经透支了全部 可是他们还是嫌少
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应我你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味
,你可知道这样会让我心碎
,我还是把你当成了我的至宝
,可你依旧选择离开让我如何是好
,虽然我不能够继续陪在你身边
,I just wanna 至少让能把你思考
,离别的话很少 一共没两句
,可是我还没有 拿到我的奖励
,那可能是朵花
,可能是温暖的家
,可能是人海中迷路的那个只属于我的她
,突然觉得自己多余 好像是末日来临这个世界
,发誓不再把你说起 我决定忘记你的一切
,在浪涛中跌跌撞撞 一个人闯荡
,如果不想看到我的泪水请你把后视镜给档上
,时刻提醒自己为了你 我不能够继续反抗
,白天很煎熬更何况是没有你的晚上
,深夜中一个人买醉
,心被掏出来狠狠的踩碎
,你带给我的痛苦比幸福竟然还多了百倍
,我再也不愿见你在深夜里买醉
,不愿见别的男人见识你的妩媚
,你该知道这样会让我心碎
,答应你从此不在深夜里徘徊
,不要轻易尝试放纵的滋味

,Now I'm on the outside
,Oh-oh,
,We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
,I'll show you what it feels like,
,Now I'm on the outside (eeeey)
,I'll show you what it feels like,
,Show you what it feels like,
,Now I'm on the outside
,Oh-oh,
,We did everything right, now I'm on the outside
,So we talked all night about the rest of our lives
,Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
,I keep thinking times will never change.
,Keep on thinking things will always be the same
,But when we leave this year we won't be.ing back
,No more hanging out cause we're on a different track
,And if you got something that you need to say
,You better say it right now cause you don't have another day
,Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
,These memories are playing like a film without sound
,And I keep thinking of that night in June
,I didn't know much of love but it came too soon
,And there was me and you
,And then we got real cool
,Stay at home talking on the telephone
,We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
,Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
,And this is how it feels...
,As we go on, we remember
,All the times we had together
,And as our lives change,.e whatever
,We will still be, friends forever
,So if we get the big jobs
,And we make the big money
,When we look back now
,Will our jokes still be funny?
,Will we still remember everything we learned in school?
,Still be trying to break every single rule
,Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
,Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan?
,I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
,Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
,And this is how it feels....
,As we go on, we remember
,All the times we had together
,And as our lives change,.e whatever
,We will still be, friends forever
,（la la la la la la la la……）
,（We will still be, friends forever）
,Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
,Can we survive it out there?
,Can we make it somehow?
,I guess I thought that this would never end
,And suddenly it's like we're women and men
,Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
,Will these memories fade when I leave this town
,I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye
,Keep on thinking it's our time to fly....
,As we go on, we remember
,All the times we had together
,And as our lives change,.e whatever
,We will still be, friends forever

,So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins and I saw you
,But that's not an invitation, that's all I get
,If this is communication I disconnect
,I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
,You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
,In the corner of your eye
,I'll never really learn how to love you
,But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky where I see you
,And that's not an invitation, that's all I get
,If this is communication I disconnect
,I've seen you, I know you but I don't know how to connect, so I disconnect
,Well this is an invitation, it's not a threat
,If you want communication that's what you get
,I'm talking and talking but I don't know how to connect
,And I hold a record for being patient with your kind of hesitation
,I need you, you want me but I don't know how to connect so I disconnect
,I disconnect

,Tonight after you were gone
,I thought a lot
,About you
,And how you've been treating me
,And I thought
,Why do I love you?
,
,Living with the memory in the glass
,Everything is so white in the past
,Cant see, everything I try to be
,Just ends up failing in front of me
,
,Brown hair, brown eyes
,You can’t compare someone’s soul by size
,So I’m living with the floorboards
,Buried with our childhood lies
,
,Out by the back were our dog used to sing
,Place me next to him
,Well never speak of this again.
,
,I found lust in petty smiles
,I got lost in you for awhile
,The ghost by the chair
,Looking at us still pulling out my hair
,I was the residence of your bed
,The emotions you never fed
,Even at this point in life
,My psychiatrist says I was better off dead
,
,So little birch, come grow on my spine
,Be the one who says you’ll always be mine
,But the fire inside, never burns that bright
,Dim with the shadows, a soul not in sight
,
,Being a wall flower is far from new to me
,Its blasphemy thinking this is what love could be
,Suicidal thoughts creeping up the back my neck
,Hanging the noose with good intentions and a welfare check
,
,Maybe I’ve just been wishing too much
,Maybe I’ve just been wishing
,
,Living with the memory in the glass
,Everything is so white in the past
,Cant see, everything I try to be
,Just ends up failing in front of me
,
,Brown hair, brown eyes
,You can’t compare someone’s soul by size
,So I’m living with the floorboards
,Buried with our childhood lies
,
,Ill park in the drive way
,Where this rain never seems to end
,Flooded gutters, flooded eyes
,Stories of a time when we can mend
,But seriously since when did anxiety become too much to swallow
,My back burner is burning a hole
,Straight through my bones leaving me hollow
,
,I guess I’m just calling
,Just to say I’ve been thinking a lot lately
,With dreams of dying
,I was stupid to think that you would change me
,I became used to breathing nicotine
,Every time our lips seem to touch
,I guess this is a stretch
,But black lungs never really meant much.
,
,I never did really mean that much did I
,I never really meant that much to you.

,行こうと思う
,A tornado flew around my room before you came
,Excuse the mess it made
,It usually doesn't rain in
,Southern California
,Much like Arizona
,My eyes don't shed tears
,But boy, they pour
,When I'm thinkin' 'bout you
,I've been thinkin' bout you
,I've been thinkin' bout you
,I've been thinkin'
,Do you think about me still?
,Do ya, do ya? Do ya, do ya
,I've been thinkin' bout you,
,You Southern California

,知らない顔しても意識し合ってる
,背伸びしたメイクドキドキだけど
,気付いてくれなきゃダメなんだから

,誰が好きだとか付き合ってるとか
,流行りの服とか期末試験とか

,会えない時間に負けない
,可愛くなるから見つけてね？
,
,ちょい大人なシャンプーいい感じかも！
,自撮りも何だか調子いいかも！
,毎日毎日騒がしいのは
,女の子だから仕方ないじゃん
,陰口や噂はやっぱ少し気にします
,カワイ子ぶってるったってカワイく見られたいんだし
,悩める少女は恋をして強くなる
,振り向いてほしいだけなの
,そばにいさせて！ね？
,話したくて話せなくて逃げちゃうんだ
,新作のチークも真っ赤に見えて意味ないじゃん…
,ずっとずっと君だけだよ？そんな事言えるはずないよ

,「照れくさいな、分かってるよ。」
,だからそばに居んだよ
,好き to 好き = 見つめ合うキセキを
,欲しがって問いかけた解き合って見つけた
,今世界は腹を立てて
,報われない恋や愛をほったらかしにしてる
,お陰様で気持ち弱る
,やるせなくて君に当たる
,誰も悪くないのに
,君 to 僕 = 惹かれ合うキセキを
,全力で追いかけた不器用に走った
,どんな願いでも一つだけ叶うのなら
,君以外の全員を幸せにしてこう言うんだ
,「あとは君だけ“僕の力”で幸せに」
,僕は君に気づかれない声で

,拖草枝平安京溜
,一蹦一跳晃悠悠
,呱呱也会谈论还是蝌蚪时候
,
,年纪还小没式神有兴趣来找茬
,偶尔漂浮一下还会收获吃的
,黑白没长大 个子小小哒
,呱呱跟随家人努力寻找妈妈
,找着找着没想到只留下呱
,他们怎么突然消失不见了
,不想思考呱呱要努力变强大
,听人说实力是最大赢家
,开心每一天 从没有忧愁
,遇到危险随身携带着一堆的召唤兽
,星辰与大海 挣脱小水沟
,实现梦想得用力跳跳抖三抖
,青蛙为什么这么优秀
,呱呱想了很久也想不透
,也许答案是被揍理由
,算了不想了再睡一宿
,今天偷酒吞的酒
,明天撩拨大天狗
,练习逃跑时要用到的猥琐流
,学习诗人向天讴
,明明嘴馋天鹅肉
,向往这么久从来没有机会得手
,
,每天(都)被莫名其妙砸家门
,热情待客最后
,又是胖揍一顿
,除了胜负这都是什么鬼啊
,好在没受伤又不会想太多
,虽然有召唤兽还是 害怕！
,遇到危险不免 闪躲！
,也会自恋一下大家其实很喜欢青蛙
,找碴同样需要很多耐心啊
,要漂漂亮亮 绿油油盛装
,听说穿成这样就算犯错也容易被人原谅
,为了灵活度 不能吃太胖
,每天起床都要蹲在田埂边放声歌唱
,今天呱呱也帅不可当
,仿佛听见全世界的夸奖
,从不曾畏惧暴雨风浪
,要出发去远航
,【呱呱可爱 特别可爱
,呱呱漂亮 特别漂亮
,呱呱强大 特别强大
,呱呱善良 特别漂亮
,呱呱聪明 特别聪明
,呱呱帅气 特别帅气
,呱呱高冷 特别高冷
,呱呱总攻 永远霸气】
,
,迟早有一天 能自由飞翔
,挣脱物种的束缚强大到能让所有式神仰望
,脚踩阴阳师 做水族之王
,努力向这个目标一步一步奋斗看得见成长
,少年人千万别太猖狂
,有只青蛙正在追赶而上
,单挑还是他习惯日常
,这累断气模样
,
,呱呱每天打架忙
,呱呱划水不用桨
,呱呱走路外八字步伐大摇大晃
,呱呱要得意洋洋
,呱呱躲藏芦苇荡
,今天的呱呱还是一如既往嚣张

On the corner
Staring at the street again
Stormy weather
Like the clouds before the break to rain
Through my head
Images I've red
Here I am
Watching light reflecting in my face
Only you can make me wonder
I don't want to cross and I remember
It's either now or never
We're made to be together
Let's make it last tonight
Memories of mad desire
Hoping that this love will last forever
It's either now or never
We're made to stay together
Let's make it last tonight
REFRAIN:
Mad desire
Burning through the night
Mad desire
Dancing in the night
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
Tried to call you
Phone was off the hook again
Passing hours
Staring through a cold and windy day
In my mind
Images I find
Here I am
Waiting for the moment you appear
Only you can make me wonder
I don't want to cross and I remember
It's either now or never
We're made to be together
Let's make it last tonight
Memories of mad desire
Hoping that this love will last forever
It's either now or never
We're made to stay together
Let's make it last tonight
Mad desire
Burning through the night
Mad desire
Dancing in the night
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat

在上一集中，易中天先生认为，任何历史人物都有三种形象：历史形象、文学形象和民间形象。而三国中，形象最复杂、分歧最多的当属
曹操。从北宋的时候，人们谈起曹操，就非常痛恨。到了《三国演义》里面，曹操更是被看作是一个谋权篡位的奸臣。那么，历史上的曹操究
竟是一个什么形象呢？厦门大学易中天教授用当代视角回顾三国史料，他心目中的曹操究竟是什么形象呢？
* 易中天：
今天我们讲曹操，讲三国是不可能不讲曹操的，所谓三国就是魏蜀吴嘛，而魏的开国皇帝实际上是曹操。当然曹操在位的时候没有称帝，
是他死了以后他儿子曹丕才称帝，追认他为魏武帝，但可以肯定曹操是魏的实际上的开创者。曹操这个人在历史上的名声不太好，客气的说法
叫奸雄，不客气的说法叫奸贼，但是鲁迅先生说，曹操其实是一个有本事的人，至少是一个英雄。我虽然不是曹操一党，但非常佩服他。鲁迅
先生可以说是近代以来第一个为曹操翻案的人，这样一来对曹操就有了三种评价——英雄、奸雄、奸贼，那么哪一个评价是准确的呢？
但是当我们弄清楚曹操的历史形象的时候，我们又发现了一个问题，就是这个历史形象它也不是那么好弄清楚的。比方说，民间都说曹操
奸，很多人不喜欢曹操。苏东坡就讲到，在北宋的时候，民间有很多讲史的，就是说书的，说三国，一说到刘备失败，听众就痛哭流涕；一说
到曹操失败了，大家拍手称快。那么说明至少在北宋的时候，曹操就是一个不讨人喜欢的人。那么曹操为什么不讨人喜欢呢？他又干了些什么
不讨人喜欢的事呢？那么也无非是三条：
一个是曹操这个人为人奸诈。但是这个不能算数，因为兵不厌诈嘛，打仗的人总是要诈它一诈的，不过你说敌人你就说他是奸诈狡猾，说
自己就叫足智多谋，实际上一回事，兵不厌诈。
第二件事情呢说他篡汉。这个事情跟我们没有关系，这个王朝的皇帝为什么一定要姓刘呢，为什么就不能姓曹呢？说这个姓曹的代替姓刘
的就是奸，这个说不过去。
那么最为民间所不满意的是曹操说了这样一句话：宁肯我负天下人，不可天下人负我。所以一个人宁肯自己对不起普天下的人，也不能让
天下的人对不起自己，这个人就太坏了，所以老百姓讨厌曹操。那么我们就要搞清楚这个事情是事实，还是不是事实；如果不是事实，那岂不
是一桩冤案吗；如果是冤案的话，我们岂不是就该给曹操平反吗。那么这个事情史书上的记载是矛盾的，大体上是这样一个故事：就是曹操因
为董卓要迫害他，曹操从京城里逃出来，路过了他一个老朋友家，这个老朋友的名字叫吕伯奢，曹操到吕伯奢家里的时候吕伯奢本人不在，于
是就发生了曹操杀吕伯奢一家的惨案。
这个故事有三个版本。第一个版本说的是吕伯奢不在，吕伯奢的儿子和吕伯奢家里的那些客人看见曹操带着钱财很多，起了歹心，要抢劫
曹操，而且拉走了他的马，这个时候曹操起来拔出剑来把这些人杀了。这个叫做正当防卫。这个故事记载在什么史书里面？在《魏书》里，《
魏书》是他们魏国人写的史书，所以也不一定靠得住，因为曹操是他们的太祖啊，那他们可能要给曹操打一个圆场，这个也很难讲。
那么第二个记载是说，曹操住在吕伯奢家里面听见吕伯奢的孩子在那弄锅碗瓢盆，有声音，曹操自己又是受董卓通缉追拿的罪犯，他起了
疑心，“疑其图己”，把吕伯奢一家杀了。这个叫做误杀。
第三个版本，差不太多，也是说曹操怀疑吕伯奢的家里人要害自己，然后把他们一家都杀了。杀了以后，曹操凄怆曰：宁我负人，毋人负
我。我们现在来看第三种情况，就算我们相信曹操是误杀了吕伯奢一家人，也说了那句话，看看是个什么样的场景。是曹操怀疑这些人要害自
己，当然这个疑心太重了一点，太过分了，然后把他一家人杀了。杀了以后发现是误杀，然后凄怆曰，“凄怆”这两个字很重要，就是杀错了
人，然后，唉，他也是很难过的，算了算了，宁肯我辜负别人，不可以别人辜负我啊。我们体察一下这个语境，曹操说这个话是一种自我安慰
、自我排解，所以很勉强地为自己的错误行为做了一个辩护。而到了《三国演义》里面他变成了理直气壮，而且把“宁我负人，毋人负我”前
面加了天下两个字，这个就大不一样了。曹操当时说这个话只是就事论事，虽然我错了，我错杀了人家我对不起人家，我现在也没有办法，我
现在走投无路，也只好是宁肯我对不起人家，不要让人家对不起我了。这里面应该说他还保留了一部分善意在里面，而到了《三国演义》变成
理直气壮说我对不起天下人，不可以天下人对不起我，那就是一个大大的奸贼。
所以曹操的奸险歹毒这一点，应该说是有疑问的。但是即便如此，《三国演义》的毛批还说了这样的话，他说什么呢，他说“此亦孟德之
过人处也”。他说即便是这样，这也是曹操比一般人不一样的、超过我们的地方！他说为什么呢，他说如果换了别人一定说，宁肯天下人都对
不起我，不可以我对不起天下人的。他说换了别人都会这样说，但是实际上怎么样呢？实际上他们干的就是曹操的勾当，只有曹操一个人坦率
地说出了这个话。那么也就是毛批认为，曹操虽然奸诈，但是奸诈里面也有坦诚，他至少敢把奸诈的话公开地说出来，他是真小人，不是伪君
子。所以他说这是曹操超过其他人的地方，因为这个世界上伪君子实在是太多了。
奸诈当中有真诚，恰恰是曹操性格的一个特征。曹操这个人是奸诈的，这一点是不可否认的，但是他也有坦诚的一面，甚至有可爱的一面
。我们就来看看曹曹性格当中矛盾的地方。
先说曹操的奸诈，最能体现曹操这个人奸诈的例子，是在他和袁绍战争中发生的一件事。我们知道三国时期有三大战役，第一次战役就是
曹袁官渡之战，第二战役是曹孙赤壁之战，第三大战役是孙刘彝陵之战。曹操就是在官渡之战以后奠定了他的历史地位，这场战争打得非常地
艰苦，非常地艰巨。当时两军对峙相持不下，而曹军军粮已经不多了，我们知道打仗拼什么？除了拼勇敢、拼武器、拼实力以外，很重要的是
拼粮饷，所谓“兵马未动，粮草先行”，没有粮食这个仗是打不下去的，曹操这个时候实际上是快要断粮了，一筹莫展。这个时候袁绍阵营里
面有一个谋士叫做许攸的突然来投奔曹操，曹操听说这个消息以后大喜过望，“跣足而出”。什么叫跣足呢？就是光着脚，那么曹操这个时候
跣足而出迎接许攸是什么原因，什么意思，有两种可能：一种是叫做来不及穿鞋，可能在洗脚在干什么，一听说许攸来了光着脚就往外跑，大
喜过望；第二种可能是表示尊敬，因为古礼光脚是尊敬。我们知道曹操后来地位很高了以后，汉献帝给了曹操一个特殊待遇，叫做带剑鞋履上
殿，叫“剑履上殿”，剑就是带剑，你可以佩着剑去见皇帝，履就是穿鞋，这说明一般的人是不能穿鞋见皇帝的。能不能穿袜子呢，看地位，
地位高的人可以“袜而登席”，穿着袜子走到席位上，地位再低一点一定要光脚。所以光脚可能是表示尊重。
这个曹操光着脚冲出去以后怎么样呢？抚掌而笑，摸着手掌哈哈大笑，说哎呀呀呀，子远你来了，“吾事济矣”，我的事情就好办了，然
后把许攸请到军帐里坐下。许攸就问了，说曹公，你的情况怎么样啊，“军粮尚有几何”，还有多少军粮啊？曹操说呵呵呵，这个我的军粮很
充足啊，足够用一年的。许攸说，错了，重讲。曹操说，半年。许攸说又错了，见到老朋友都不说老实话，说实话吧，再给你一次机会。曹操
说，哎呀这个，不好意思，刚才开玩笑，实话告诉你，只够一个月。接着曹操说了一句刘邦最爱说的话，“为之奈何”，怎么办吧？许攸说：
“公孤军独守，外无救援，而粮谷已尽，此危机之日也。”说你带着一支军队，孤军深入，粮草已经没有了，这是非常危险的，怎么办呢？我
告诉你，在某某地方袁绍藏了一批粮食，有一条什么样的小路你可以过去，你赶紧率轻骑到那个地方焚其粮草，不出三日，袁军必乱。
曹操说太好了，然后自己亲自率领五千骑兵，连夜抄小路过去，换上袁军的服装，碰上沿路的岗哨说是袁公让我们来干什么什么事的，冲
到袁营。袁营一看，来了曹军烧粮食，当然也拼死奋战，当时情况非常地紧张。曹操左右的人跑过来说，曹公，敌人来了。曹操说，慌什么？
敌人到我背后以后再说这话，上。然后把袁绍的粮草全部烧光，从而扭转了这个局势。
所以曹操的这个性格里面确实有奸诈的一面，但是我觉得他这种奸诈某种意义上也是逼出来的。那样一个险恶的环境，他如果事事都说老
实话，这还能够克敌制胜吗？他不能不撒谎啊，他甚至养成撒谎的习惯了。
曹操也是一个温情的人。在曹操和张绣的战争中，他的长子曹昂在战斗中牺牲了，他的原配丁夫人悲痛得死去活来。因为丁夫人是曹操的
正妻，她是没有生育能力的，曹操的妾生下了长子，这就是曹昂，生下来以后曹昂的母亲就去世了，生母就去世了，就把曹昂交给丁夫人来抚
养，丁夫人把这个儿子看作自己的儿子，情感非常地深。而曹操之所以打败这一仗，是因为他当时得意忘形，他跟张绣的战争没有怎么打张绣
就投降了，投降了以后曹操不但收编了张绣的部队，还收编了张绣的婶婶，张绣的婶婶是一个美女，曹操这个人是很好色的，走到哪他都要收
编一些美女，于是把张绣的婶婶收编了。张绣的面子上就下不来，再加上其他的原因张绣后来就反叛他，对他进行突然袭击。这次战争中曹昂
也死了，曹操的侄子草安民也死了，还有曹操的爱将典韦也死了，丁夫人就不愿意了，就哭着闹着跟曹操要儿子，你还我儿子，你把我儿子弄
哪儿去了！而且就是你这个家伙，一天到晚地泡烂妞，害得我儿子死掉的，不依不饶。曹操一烦，滚，回你老家去。走就走嘛，我回娘家去，
不跟你过了，真回娘家了。
过了半年，大概几个月以后，曹操后悔了，然后自己驾着车子，就到丁夫人的娘家想把丁夫人接回来。这个事情在我们今天也稀松平常啦
，小两口一吵架，老婆跑回娘家去了，那还不是老公最后赔个笑脸，说点好话，就把老婆接回来了。曹操这样做就不容易了，是吧，你想曹操
那阎王脾气，他也这么做，也去接丁夫人。丁夫人在家干什么，织布，曹操来了以后她也不站起来迎接，也不搭理，曹操很没意思，讪讪地走
过去：织布呢？……别织了，跟我回家吧。……曹操就走过去，用手摸着丁夫人的背：唉，别使小性子了，宝贝，跟我回家好不好？我们坐车
子回家好不好？要知道这个动作是很重要的，这个“抚其背”是男人对女性的一种爱的动作。丁夫人继续“咔嚓”“咔嚓”。曹操就很没意思
啦：你不回啊？不回那我可是走了啊。“咔嚓”“咔嚓”。曹操就走走走，往外走，走到门口的时候又回了一次头：别闹了，跟我回家，好不
好？“咔嚓”“咔嚓”。唉，看来我们夫妻缘分已尽，算了。然后找到老丈人：岳父大人，是我对不起你女儿，但是她也不肯跟我回去，这样
吧，她还年轻，别让她守着，你把她嫁了，让她改嫁。
你想想以曹操那种铁石心肠、阎王脾气，做到这一步已经是非常非常不容易了，说明他是很重情的。当然，最后丁夫人的父亲也没敢把丁
夫人嫁出去，丁夫人没有改嫁，最后也没有改嫁。估计老丈人也不敢嫁，丁夫人也不肯嫁，也没人敢娶，你说谁敢娶阎王的前妻？不是找不自
在吗。这个事情曹操一直耿耿于怀，曹操临死的时候说了这样一句话，他说我这一生好事干过，坏事也干过，有成功的地方，也有错误的地方
，我不在乎，只有一件事情，就是我到了地下、到了九泉，子休——子休就是曹昂的字，曹昂字子休，就是指曹昂了——说子休如果哭着闹着
跟我要妈妈，我不知道怎么回答。你想曹操这一生犯多少错误，他居然认为他最大的错误就是这个，就是把她的妻子气走了！说明曹操是一个
多情的人，是一个儿女情长的人，是一个重感情的人，这是曹操的温情。
但是你要认为曹操多么温柔，那就错了。曹操是很狠毒的，可以说是翻脸就不认识人。比方说我前面说的那个许攸，许攸来投奔曹操是起
到了关键作用的，所以许攸也很得意，许攸经常跟曹操说，哎，阿瞒，他不叫他什么曹公啊、什么明公啊、或者什么丞相这些，他叫他小名。
曹操有两个小名，一个叫吉利，一个叫阿瞒，叫他小名：阿瞒啊，要是没有我许某人，你可是没有今天啊！曹操只好赔着笑脸说，啊是是是，
许先生说得对，没有你的帮忙我确实是没有今天。但是许攸不停地说，这个就很讨厌了，对不对，这好比说你送了我这件衣服，我穿上很漂亮
我当然很高兴，但是我每穿这件衣服你就要站出来对着大家说，哎大家伙看看啊，他这件衣服是我送给他的，我要不送给他这件衣服他可是没
衣服穿啊。我能高兴吗？那何况是曹操呢？有一次曹操打下邺城，许攸又在那儿对大家说，大家看，如果没有我的话，他们曹家人就进不了这
个门了。曹操实在是忍无可忍，杀了，把许攸杀了，这就是曹操的狠毒。
曹操杀了于他有恩的许攸，却放了很多对不起他的人。比方说有一个人叫做魏种，原来是曹操的手下。曹操有一段时候我们知道他是不顺
的，处于逆境，处于困境的，那个时候很多手下的人都背叛曹操，曹操非常自信地说让他们走吧，我的人不会走完的，比方说魏种，他就不会
背叛我。结果呢，这个魏种也背叛了，魏种也跑掉了。曹操气坏了，曹操说好你个魏种啊，你也背叛我，你有本事跑到天涯海角，北边有本事
你跑匈奴去，南边有本事你跑到越南去，你只要跑不了那么远我就要把你抓回来，绝饶不了你。
后来在后面的战斗中，魏种被俘虏了，所有的人都给魏种捏一把汗，说曹操肯定要杀他。曹操怎么样？曹操想了一下，算了吧，魏种是个
人才，放了，该做什么官还做什么官。这是曹操的宽容啊。
曹操确实是一个很宽容的人。曹操和袁绍作战的时候，袁绍找了一个文人，叫做陈琳，起草一篇檄文。什么叫檄文呢，就是声讨书，因为
古代作战他讲究师出有名，就是你要打谁谁谁你总要有个名目，有了名目以后你这个军队才叫做正义之师，袁绍就请陈琳写一篇檄文。陈琳是
个笔杆子，下笔千言，洋洋洒洒，痛骂曹操。从哪骂起呢，从曹操的祖宗骂起，这实在说起来是在中国文化当中一种很不好的东西，一骂人就
骂到人家父母亲，一骂人就骂到人家祖宗八代，动不动就是怎么你祖宗八代，这是不好的一个传统，陈琳也是这样。那么后来袁绍打败了，陈
琳做了俘虏，下面人把陈琳抓到曹操跟前，曹操说：陈琳啊，两军交战，都要发表这样的声讨书，这个很正常，不过呢，你骂骂我就算了嘛，
你骂我父母干什么，我父母又没得罪你，不好吧！陈琳说，对不起啊，箭在弦上，不得不发。曹操说，好好好，算了算了，你也是个人才，还
做你的笔杆子吧。陈琳以后就成了曹操的笔杆子，所以曹操是很宽容的。
但是曹操又是一个报复心极强的人，但凡是得罪了曹操的人，几乎没有不报复的。当时有一位名士，叫做边让，边让是个大学问家，也是
大文学家，文章著作写得非常好的，看不起曹操。因为曹操这个人出身不好，曹操的祖父是个太监，这个东汉朝代是叫太监给搞坏的，所以那
些读书人、那些文化人、那些士大夫最看不起的、最痛恨的就是太监。那么曹操的父亲是太监的养子，曹操就等于是太监养子的儿子，他们看
不起，边让也看不起他，很说了一些侮辱曹操的话。所以后来曹操过去把那个地方打下来以后，毫不留情地就把边让杀了，和边让一案的还同
时有好几个文化人，有的就跑掉，跑掉以后又逃不掉，然后又回来自首。其中有一个叫桓邵的向曹操自首，跪下来求，磕头，痛哭流涕，求饶
，曹操怎么说呢？哼哼，呵呵呵呵，哭了，怕了，下跪了，求饶了，下跪就不杀吗？求饶就不杀吗？拖出去，杀了。这件事情影响极坏，当时
就引发了一场叛乱，就是你怎么可以这样对待文化人？你怎么可以这样对待以前得罪过你的人？
其中有一个叫陈宫的，就是由于这个原因离开了曹操，投奔了吕布。《三国演义》里面说，陈宫离开曹操是因为曹操杀了吕伯奢一家。不
是，史实是曹操杀了边让、桓邵这些人陈宫看不下去，离开曹操，死心塌地地帮助吕布打曹操。后来吕布战败以后，陈宫做了俘虏，曹操还不
想杀他，曹操跟陈宫说只要你投降，既往不咎。因为曹操这个时候他也觉得以前的做法不对了，他也觉得宰相肚里要撑船，将军额上跑马，应
该有一些大将风度了，所以他也不杀陈宫。陈宫坚决不投降，曹操没办法，只好杀他，临杀他之前曹操问了这样的话，陈宫的字叫公台，他说
公台啊公台，你要是死了，你的母亲可怎么办啊？陈宫说，我听说以孝治天下的人不会杀害他人的父母，我的母亲怎么样，就靠曹公你看着办
。曹操说好，公台啊公台，你死了以后你的老婆孩子又怎么办？陈宫说，我听说以仁治天下的人不伤害人家的子女，我的老婆孩子如何，也请
曹公你看着办。啊，曹操说好吧，那我送你上路。然后就开始哭，一边哭一边送陈宫上刑场去死，然后把陈宫的家人接到自己家里来，对待陈
宫的家人比陈宫和他翻脸之前还好。
所以曹操这个人是个很复杂的人，刚才我们已经讲到了他的方方面面，这还不是他性格的全部，是他性格的一部分。他既狡诈又老实，既
温情又狠毒，既宽容又报复。如果你只看曹操的一个故事，只看曹操的一面，你得出的结论就是盲人摸象，是不全面的。那么在我们看来，曹
操可能是中国历史上性格最复杂、形象最多样的一个人。他这个人聪明透顶，又愚不可及；狡猾奸诈，又坦率真诚；豁达大度，又疑神疑鬼；
宽宏大量，又心胸狭窄。可以说是大家风范，小人嘴脸；英雄气概，儿女情怀；阎王脾气，菩萨心肠。他是这样的一个人，他身上好像长了很
多的脸，一会儿出现的是这张脸，一会儿展示给我们的是另一张脸。但是大家注意一条，不管哪张脸，都是曹操的，不会认做是别人的。能够
把这样一个复杂的性格统一于一个人，这本身就是了不起的事情。体现的是什么呢？体现的是曹操的大气。什么叫大气？海纳百川，有容乃大
，曹操恰恰是一个能够容的，一个容量非常大的人，什么样的矛盾的东西到他这儿都统一了。
而且他奸诈一生，最后归于真实，曹操临死的时候留下了一个遗令。当时写这个遗令，就是遗嘱，写遗嘱，大人物写遗嘱有一个格式的，
说说我一生做了哪些功劳啊，也检讨一下自己，然后说我要埋在什么什么地方等等，是这样的遗嘱。曹操的遗嘱不是这样，曹操的遗嘱对于自
己的政治生涯提得非常少，他只说了这么一句话，他说我这一生做了很多的事情，有对的也有错的，总的来说是对的，至于犯的小错误、发的
大脾气不值得你们效仿。就这一句话交代完了，下面讲什么呢？就唠唠叨叨地讲一些家务事，他说我死了以后，我那个房子里放的那个香，就
是熏香，香料，你们把它分掉，不要浪费了。我的那些小老婆，还有我那些歌女，她们一生都很辛苦，为我服务得很好，很到位，不要亏待她
们，让她们继续住在铜雀台，不要把她们赶走了，这些人闲着也是闲着，没有事做，可以学习做什么呢，学习用丝带编草鞋，万一将来我们曹
家破产了，可以拿这些鞋去卖换点饭吃。唠唠叨叨讲了一大堆这种事，所以他这份遗嘱当时很被人看不起，说一个大英雄临死之前也不说点豪
言壮语，也不说点励志的话鼓励一下我们后来人，“分香卖履，留恋妾妇”，成何体统！连苏东坡都给了八个字的评价，叫做“平生奸伪，死
见真性”，说这个家伙一辈子狡猾奸诈，临死之前露了马脚，狐狸尾巴露出来了，原来是这么一个小人。
但是我对苏东坡先生一贯尊敬，对于他这句话是不以为然的，我认为这恰恰表现出曹操的大气。我就不说豪言壮语，我就不谈政治功劳，
我就不谈国家大事，我就要谈这些小事，你们把我怎么样？你能把我咋地？你们说我是小人我就是小人又怎么样？我曹操就是曹操，我曹操才
不在乎你们怎么评价我呢，我就是这样的人。这叫什么？“惟大英雄能本色，是真名士自风流”，曹操能够如此地本色，说明他是英雄，而且
是大英雄！不过这个英雄是很狡猾的，很奸诈的，因此是奸猾的英雄，简称奸雄。而这个奸雄呢，又是非常可爱的，所以我认为对曹操的评价
就是这五个字——可爱的奸雄，那么曹操又如何是个奸雄呢，他怎样地奸雄呢，他又怎样地可爱呢？请看下集奸雄之谜，谢谢。
在上一集中，易中天先生分析了曹操的多重性格，认为性格复杂的曹操是一个肚量很大的人，有海纳百川的胸怀和气魄，这体现了曹操的
大气和本色。但是据史书记载，曹操在小时候游手好闲，喜欢胡作非为，这样的人长大了为什么会有出息？曹操又为什么被称为奸雄？对于曹
操是乱世奸雄的说法，易中天先生的看法是什么呢？他是怎样分析和评价的呢？
* 易中天：
今天我们继续讲曹操，在上一集我们提出了一个观点，就是曹操是可爱的奸雄，是不是这样呢？我们先来说“奸雄”，再来看“可爱”。
什么叫奸雄？“奸雄”这个概念包括了两个内容，就是奸和雄，只有那些又奸又雄的人才能够叫做英雄。比如像明朝的奸臣严嵩，鬼鬼祟
祟，偷偷摸摸，使用的是阴柔手段，奸而不雄，这个只能叫奸贼；如果像东汉末年的董桌那样，横行霸道，专横跋扈，雄而不奸，使用的是暴
力手段，那只能叫枭雄。枭雄就是强硬而又有野心的人物，奸贼就是奸猾而又有贼心的人物，奸雄是奸诈而又有雄心的人物，那么曹操是不是
这样的人呢？是。
曹操这个人从小就奸猾。曹操的家庭出身是不太好的，史书上的说法说他是相国曹参之后，这是胡说，为什么呢？因为曹操的父亲叫曹嵩
，曹嵩是什么人呢？是太监曹滕的养子，太监是不生孩子的，曹嵩是养子而非生子，那么我们即便考证出曹腾的祖上是西汉初年的相国曹参，
跟曹操有什么关系？而且在东汉末年我们知道，“乱国者宦官也”，那么一个宦官的养子的儿子，在当时的上流社会是没有地位的，人家是看
不起的，认为这是一个孽种。所以曹操的出身是不好的。
当然家境很好，因为他的这个养祖父和他的父亲都在朝廷中做官，家境好，而出身门第应该说不好。曹操小时候受的教育也不好，曹操后
来有一首诗回忆自己的童年，“既无三徙教，不闻过庭语”。什么叫“三徙教”呢？三徙教就是大家都熟悉的孟母择邻的故事，孟子的母亲为
了给自己的儿子有一个好的教育环境，三次搬家，叫做三徙，所以孟子母亲的这种教育叫做三徙教，曹操说这个事儿我们家是没有的；“不闻
过庭语”是什么意思呢？讲的是孔子和他儿子孔鲤的故事，说有一天孔子站在庭院里，他的儿子孔鲤“趋而过庭”，什么叫“趋”呢，“趋”
就是小步快走，是表示恭敬的动作，在上级面前、在长辈面前你走路要“趋”，低着头，很快很快地这样走过去，这叫“趋”。那么孔鲤看见
父亲孔子站在庭院里面，于是低着头“趋”，孔子说站住，学诗了吗？没有。不学诗何以言，你不学诗你怎么会说话？是，退而学诗。又一天
，孔子又站在庭院里，孔鲤又“趋而过庭”，孔子说，站住，学礼了吗？还没有。不学礼何以立，不学礼你怎么做人？是，退而学礼。这个故
事就叫做“过庭语”，也叫“庭训”，父亲对儿子的教育在古代就叫“庭训”。曹操说这个事情我们家也是没有的。所以家教不好。
曹操出身不好，家教不好，小时候的表现也不好。喜欢什么呢？飞鹰走狗，四处游荡，不务正业，游手好闲，和一群纨绔子弟胡作非为。
那他的纨绔子弟的朋友有袁绍，有张邈，都是些高干子弟了，这些人当中就数曹操的坏主意和鬼点子最多。大概当时也是闹得不太像话，于是
曹操有个叔叔就跟他父亲说，说你这个儿子实在是调皮捣蛋，不守规矩，管教管教。曹操的父亲就来管教他，曹操就对他叔叔有意见，他就想
了一个歪主意，有一天他叔叔走过来以后，曹操马上把嘴巴一歪，叔叔说你怎么了？中风了。叔叔一看很紧张，马上向他父亲报告说你儿子中
风了，你快看看。曹操的父亲过来以后，曹操非常正常。他说你不是中风了吗？谁中风了，谁说我中风了，没中风啊，谁说的？你叔叔说的啊
，你叔叔说你中风了。爸，我叔不喜欢我，看见我就烦，他说我中风爸你能相信吗？曹操的爸爸从此不相信他的叔叔。
更离谱的是什么呢？是有一天这几个高干子弟在那儿百无聊赖，说今天都没有什么好玩儿的，那个时候的确好玩的东西也不多，不像现在
可以上网。我们都无聊啊，有什么好玩的吗？曹操说，有件好玩儿的事，今天有人结婚，我们去闹一闹。袁绍他们说，闹什么闹？偷新娘子。
袁绍说好，我们就去偷新娘子。然后一伙人就跑到结婚的人家，到了晚上快要入洞房了，大家都在喝喜酒，曹操就大喊一声：有贼啊！所有的
宾客都跑出来抓贼，贼在哪儿？曹操就冲进洞房，把新娘子偷出来，偷出来往外跑，袁绍笨一点，一头钻进一个灌木丛，灌木把衣服都钩住了
，跑不脱。袁绍说曹操你快帮忙，我这个地方跑不出来了！曹操又把手往袁绍那一指：大家看，贼在这儿！袁绍一听着急，这么一使劲蹦出来
了。所以曹操是一个从小就调皮捣蛋的家伙，也很狡诈，这样的孩子大概是不讨人喜欢的。其实啊依我看，这个男孩小时候也是要捣蛋一点，
男孩小时候不捣蛋长大了没出息，可是大家都不喜欢他，史书上的说法是世人“未之奇也”，当时的人也没把他当回事。
［画话音］通过易中天先生的讲述我们可以看到，小时候的曹操鬼点子多，调皮捣蛋，不讨人喜欢，也不被人重视。但曹操在青年时期却
受到当时最高军事长官的另眼相看，而且还得到另一个著名人物的高度评价，这个评价竟然流传千古。那么，这个著名人物是谁？他到底是怎
样评价曹操的呢？
但是有一个人非常看重曹操，这个人就是当时的太尉桥玄，太尉是什么官？三军总司令，全国最高军事长官，桥玄非常看重曹操，说曹操
这个人是个难得的人才。所以桥玄找到曹操说，我们现在遇到的将是一个乱世，这个乱世非“命世之才”不可，我看你就是将来平定天下的人
，我桥某已经老了，我把我的妻子和我的子孙就托付给你了。那时候曹操才二十岁啊，那么桥玄为什么这样看重曹操呢？就是因为曹操虽然调
皮捣蛋，不守规矩，胡作非为，但他不是一般意义上的纨绔子弟。第一，他才艺过人，文章写得好，文笔非常之好，自己就是文学家；第二，
武功好，据说曹操有一次行刺张让的时候被人发现，他是用手武着戟，一边武戟一边往后退，全身而退。武艺好，而且好读书。这点非常重要
，好读书，尤好兵书，跟据史书上的记载，曹操终其一生都是爱读书的，即便是行军打仗的时候也手不释卷。那么这样一个文武全才，又很狡
猾，那就是乱世当中平定天下的人。
而且桥玄不但自己赏识他，还介绍他去拜见许劭，许劭是什么人呢？许劭是当时有名的鉴赏家。东汉末年有一个风气，就是要进行人物鉴
赏，或者叫人物品评，一个人要成为一个人物，要出人头地，要进入上流社会，必须有著名的人物鉴赏家给他写一个鉴定，这样才能得到社会
的承认。许劭就是一个有名的鉴赏家，他在，每个月初的初一，要对当时的人物发表一次评论，就像我们现在开新闻发布会一样，每月初一，
所以叫月旦评。桥玄就跟曹操说，你曹操要进入上流社会，出人头地，你一定要得到许劭的评语。那么曹操就决定去找许劭，许劭拒绝发表意
见，许劭为什么拒绝发表意见呢现在我们不知道，也可能他是看不上曹操，也可能他觉得曹操这个人不好说，也可能有别的什么考虑反正不知
道什么原因，许劭是死活都不肯讲。但是我们现在也不知道曹操使了一个什么手段，这个没有任何记载，但是我估计曹操是使用了一点不正当
的手段，逼着许劭发表意见，许劭逼得没有办法说了一句有名的话，他说你这个人啊，是“治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄”。
那么曹操听到这句话后的反应是什么，也就是说曹操是否认奸雄可这个评语？正史上的记载是这样的，“太祖大笑”，就是曹操一听许劭
说你是“治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄”曹操就哈哈大笑，哈哈哈哈……这句话到了《三国演义》里面做了改动，改成什么呢，“操闻之大喜”。
一个是大笑，一个是大喜，一字之差，有天壤之别，表现了什么呢，表现了小说的肤浅，《三国演义》这个小说他是要贬低曹操的，它为了贬
低曹操他不惜把大笑改成大喜。“大喜”给人的感觉就是曹操这个人好像从小立志就要当一个奸雄，听说我可以当个奸雄，他高兴得不得了！
这不是事实，它也不合逻辑，你说哪有一个人从小立志我就是要当个贼，我从小就下定决心要当个强盗，我从小就立下志向要当窃国大盗，不
可能的，奸雄那是逼出来的，奸雄要碰到乱世嘛，碰到乱世他当能臣当不了，他只好去当奸雄了。所以改成大喜是很肤浅的。
我们来看许劭的这个话，“治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄”什么意思？有两种解释：一种是你曹操如果身逢治世，那你能够成为一个能臣；你
如果身逢乱世，那你就是一个奸雄。那也就是说曹操是做能臣还是做奸雄，看什么呢，看客观条件，是不是，看你处于一个什么时代。第二种
解释是你曹操如果治理天下，那你就是能臣；如果扰乱天下，那你就是奸雄。成为能臣还是成为奸雄看曹操的主观愿望，所以他这一句话是有
两种可能的，有两种解释的，而甚至可能许劭说的这两层意思都有。
那么曹操大笑就有三种可能。第一种可能，我怎么会是治世之能臣、乱世之奸雄呢，太可笑了，呵呵太可笑了，大笑。第二种是，哦，我
如果处在治世就是能臣，处在乱世就是奸雄，成为一个能臣“固所愿也”，哎，打个折扣，成奸雄也不错，哈哈哈哈哈大笑。第三种，哦，我
要想成能臣我就能成能臣，我想做奸雄就能做奸雄，我想治理天下我就是能臣，想扰乱天下我就是奸雄，反正我什么都能干，哈哈哈哈，这太
好了。那么曹操完全有可能是这三种原因大笑，但是在我们看来曹操这个人可能是后两种原因大笑，因为曹操这个人是一定要做一番事业的，
这个是肯定的，我立志要做一番事业，我要轰轰烈烈地活在这个世界上，逢治世则造福一方，逢乱世我就称霸一方，反正我不能碌碌无为地平
平淡淡地了此一生。这就是我曹操，这话说到我心里去了，哈哈哈哈——。至于给我一个什么头衔，是能臣的头衔呢，还是奸雄的头衔呢，无
所谓。这种无所谓的精神正是一种大气，是一种雄视天下、笑傲江湖的英雄气。所以我们说曹操虽然被称为奸雄，虽然很多人都关注到他的奸
，但是我认为更本质的是雄，曹操一生都表现出了这种雄，我行我素，笑傲江湖。曹操是非常喜欢笑的，如果我们去读历史，我们会发现许多
书上讲到曹操遇到什么事情的时候都有笑这个字。当然曹操的笑有各种各样的笑，有放声大笑，也有自我调侃的苦笑，还有讥笑，还有冷笑，
甚至是充满杀机的冷笑，但是曹操始终在笑。
如果比较一下《三国演义》里面的刘备我们就会发现，这两个人的性格有很大的不同，刘备在干什么呢，刘备不停地在哭，而曹操不停的
在笑。曹操也哭，他的战友去世，他的朋友去世，他的亲人去世，曹操也会嚎啕大哭，但是曹操如果做错了事情，曹操打了败仗，曹操遭到人
家的羞辱，曹操绝对不会哭，他一定会笑。因为曹操是一个大气磅礴的人，我们去读读曹操的诗，就可以感觉到这种大气，所以古人评价曹操
说“曹公古直，甚有悲凉之句”。你去读读曹操的诗，“东临碣石，以观沧海……秋风萧瑟，洪波涌起。日出之行，若出其中；星汉灿烂，若
出其里。”多大的气派啊！所以毛泽东后来回忆说，“往事越千年，魏武挥鞭，东临碣石有遗篇。萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间。”指的就是曹
操的诗，是非常大气。
［画话音］通过易中天先生的分析我们可以看出，曹操是一个大气的人，他虽然被称为乱世之奸雄，但他身上的奸和雄更本质的是雄，在
他身上自有一种英雄气概。而曹操除了英雄气概以外，他的性格和普通人有什么区别呢？生活中的曹操又是怎样的呢？
正是由于这种大气，使曹操这个奸雄平添了许多可爱。曹操这个认识很可爱的，他在生活当中非常可爱，他是一个生活很随和的人，吃不
讲究，穿不讲究，住也不讲究，饭能吃饱就行，衣能穿暖就行，房子能避风雨就行，惟一的嗜好就是女人啊，不知道他这方面讲究不讲究，不
过我看他到处留情的做法，好像也不太讲究。他平时如果不是正式的场合，他是喜欢穿便服的，而且随身还带个小包包，包包里面装些个手绢
啊，七七八八的东西挂在腰上晃荡晃荡，他也不在乎，如果不是正式开会，不是讨论什么问题，不是上朝，不是礼仪性活动，和朋友们一起吃
吃饭，他是很随便的，说说笑笑，开玩笑，说段子，谁要说一个好笑的话，曹操哈哈大笑，笑得弯了腰，结果头会栽到菜盘子里面去，弄得满
脸都是汤水，他也不在乎。所以生活当中的曹操是一个非常可爱的人，战场上的曹操也很可爱。
有一次曹操西征，率领军队和敌人正面交锋，决战前夕对方听说是曹操亲自来了，秩序大乱，将士们都伸长了脖子，踮起脚尖看看曹操，
都想看曹操，结果后面的人往前面挤，前面的人也再往前挤，混乱不堪。曹操打马上前，一个人骑着马：诸位是想看曹操吧，我就是曹操，我
就是，大家看啊，看清楚了吧，两个眼睛一个鼻子，也是个人，跟你们一样啊，没什么两样啊，要说我比你们多点什么吧，告诉你，我比你们
多一点智慧。非常精彩，大实话，是啊，你我都是人，不多手不多脚，但是我多智慧，很可爱吧！
那么朋友之间的曹操，就更可爱了。我们知道使曹操能够进入上流社会，最先给予曹操极高评价的就是那位太尉桥玄，桥玄死了以后曹操
曾经去祭奠他，曹操路过他的坟前的时候，举行了一个盛大的祭祀仪式，使用了太牢的标准，太牢的祭祀仪式，至少要用一头牛。然后发表一
篇祭文，悼词。曹操的悼词怎么说呢，说桥公啊，我来看你老人家了，记得你老人家当年和我约定，说将来我路过您的坟前的时候，如果不拿
一只鸡、一壶酒来祭拜的话，我走出三步以外我肚子就要疼。这是你老人家当年跟我的约定吧，今天我带着太牢来祭奠你老人家了，我的肚子
就不疼了吧！你说有这样的悼词吗？这也就是曹操写得出来。这个是曹操性格所使然，也是当时的风尚所使然，当时的风尚，鲁迅先生有个说
法，叫“尚通脱”，就是大家都很开朗，曹操的儿子曹丕也是这样的。曹丕有个好朋友叫王粲，也是著名的文学家，建安七子之一王粲，王粲
去世以后曹丕这个时候已经就是接班人，虽然不能叫皇太子，但已经是接班人，地位很高，五官中郎将，他带着一帮文学界的朋友，就是当时
文联作协的人一起去给王粲送行，开追悼会。那当然是曹丕出来致悼词，曹丕怎么致悼词呢，曹丕说咱也别说什么套话、官话、屁话了，王粲
这个人生前喜欢听驴叫，我们每人都学一声驴叫。结果王粲墓前响起一片驴叫声，追悼会就开完了。非常可爱啊。
那么曹操最可爱之处，是他说真话。大家可能要说了，曹操不是个奸雄吗，不是个奸诈的人吗，他会说真话吗？是的，曹操也说假话，他
要进行政治斗争，要进行军事斗争，要在官场上混，一点假话不说那是不可能的，但是曹操只要有机会他就说真话。他有一篇有名的文章叫做
《让县自明本志令》，又叫做《述志令》，这可以算得上是曹操的政治纲领，那是一点官话都没有，说得非常实在。
曹操一开始说，我这个人其实是没有什么雄心壮志的，因为我知道我出身不好，当然他没有说我是太监的养子的儿子，他说我知道我自己
不是那种很清高的、很知名的那些人士，所以我最大的理想就是当一个郡守，“好作政教”，好好地把这个地方治理好，让大家都知道我曹操
虽然出身不好，工作能力还是有的。后来国家遇到了动乱，我觉得一个男子汉应该为国家效劳，建功立业，我出来带兵打仗，这个时候我的要
求也不高，我想当个什么呢？我想当个征西将军，我死了以后能够在我的墓碑上写上一行字，“故征西大将军曹侯之墓”，哎呀，我就心满意
足了。可是后来董桌造乱，诸侯并起，我这个时候不能不出来保卫国家，保卫皇上。即便是这个时候，我也不想多带兵，所以我每打一次胜仗
，我的部队增加了以后，我要裁军。为什么呢？因为我的实力越大，我的敌人就越多啊，人家都要来打我，我保不住自己，所以我胜利一回我
裁军一回。这说明什么，说明我的志向是有限的，但是我也没有想到怎么现如今我给弄出这么大动静来了！那么现在我的野心大一点了，我想
当个什么呢？当个齐桓公，晋文公，因为现在是天下大乱，诸侯割据，我只想称霸，不想称帝，我现在已经是汉朝的丞相了，作为人臣之贵，
已经到了极点，我心满意足，再无奢望。但是我必须在这个位置上坐着。
他下面说了句有名的话，他说“设使国家无有孤，不知几人称帝，几人称王。”不是我曹操在这个地方镇住，什么孙权，什么刘备，七七
八八的那些人不早就称皇帝了，就是因为我曹某人在这儿镇住嘛！我这些话不光是跟诸位说说，我经常跟我的老婆孩子说，甚直我对我的老婆
、我的那些妾们说，我死了以后你们一定要改嫁，为什么呢？以便把我这个志向传播出去啊。但是现在有人说我曹操应该功成身退了，我应该
到我封的那个侯国去安度晚年啊，我应该把我的职务和权力交出来了。对不起，不行，职务我是不辞的，权力我是不交的，为什么？我现在手
握兵权，才有了这一呼百应的权威，我一旦把这军权交出去，那你们不害我吗？你们肯定都起来害我，那我的老婆孩子就不能保全，而且皇上
也不得安全，所以我绝不交权。至于皇上封给我的一些土地，那是不需要的，我要那么多土地干什么呢？这个我让出去。
所以曹操说了这么十六个字，“江湖未静，不得让位，至于邑土，可得而辞。”就是我可以让一些虚的东西出去，实的东西那我是不让的
，这叫做“不得幕虚名，而处实祸也。”这话说得实在吧！说得再实在没有了，你说我没有野心，我有一点，而且我的野心是一点一点大起来
的；你说我有很大的野心，我不想当皇帝，我只想当晋文公，齐桓公，九合诸侯，统一中国；你说我清高，我不清高，我实在得很，我的权力
、我的实惠我一点都不让；你说我不忍让，我忍让啊，你封给我那些虚的东西，什么土地啊、头衔啊我都让出去。而且最可爱的在于什么，曹
操还明明白白说，我为什么要写这篇文章，我为什么要说这些话？就是想让你们天下人都没话可说，都给我把嘴巴闭起来。实在是不能再实在
了。这种话也只有曹操这样大气的奸雄才说得出来。
曹操这样做也是非常英明的，因为他非常知道在一个人人都说假话的时代最有力的武器是真话。因为人家都说假话，你说真话，人家就没
辙了，他的戏就演不下去了，西洋镜就拆穿了，把戏就不能玩了，只好不吭起了。当然曹操这样说也不完全是出于斗争的策略，也出于他的天
性，他确实是一个天性爱说真话的人，因此只要有机会，他是一定会说真话的。哪怕是说假话，或者说一些半真半假的话，或者是把假话藏在
真话的后面，曹操也做得非常自然。现在我们可以得出一个结论，曹操是可爱的奸雄，他的奸与雄统一于雄。
在汉朝，孝廉科是一项重要的用人制度，只有被推举为孝廉的人才会步入仕途。曹操因为被推举为孝廉，又有身为高官的的父亲做后台，
所以在二十岁的时候就顺利进入官场。然而不久一件突发事件却令曹操陷入了进退两难的政治漩涡：进，则得罪当今权贵，失去大好的政治前
途；退，则违背自己的政治理想，与权贵同流合污。那么，意气风发的曹操该何去何从呢？易中天先生将站在平民立场，通过现代视角为您精
彩品三国之——能臣之路。
* 易中天：
在上一集我们讲到当时的最有名的人物鉴赏家和品评家许劭，对曹操又一个评价，就说你是治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄。这句话可以有两种
解释，一种是处在治世就是能臣，处在乱世就是奸雄；第二种解释，你治理天下就是能臣，扰乱天下就是奸雄。那么曹操到底是做能臣还是做
奸雄呢？其实曹操原本是想做能臣的。
公元174年，二十岁的曹操被举为孝廉，担任郎官。孝就是孝子，廉就是廉士，一个人如果被举为孝廉，那么他就有了做官的资格，就好比
现在你有了一个学历、有了一个文凭你就可以去考公务员。那么担任郎官是怎么回事呢？汉代的官制，皇帝要从亲贵子弟当中挑选一些大家认
为道德品质、思想表现和外部形象都比较好的年轻人做郎。郎这个字有两个意思，一个是年轻人或者小伙子，还有一个意思就是侍卫，实际上
到宫廷里面去做郎，也就是做皇帝的侍卫，因为这个皇帝的侍卫是要在皇宫的走廊里站岗的，所以他称之为郎，侍卫长就叫做郎中令。那么在
皇帝的身边做了郎就参与了帝国的政治，耳濡目染可以得到锻炼，所以做了郎官以后很快就可以去担任别的官职，这是汉代培养干部的一种方
式，在皇帝身边，它不过是走向仕途的一个资格和阅历。
那么曹操举为孝廉，担任郎官，这就向仕途迈出了第一步。再加上曹操是朝中有人，曹操的祖父曹腾是皇上信任的宦官，曹操的父亲曹嵩
也在朝中为高官，所以曹操没过多久就被任命为洛阳北部尉，洛阳北部尉是一个什么官职呢？洛阳当时是帝国的一个县，但是是首县，因为洛
阳是东汉王朝的首都所在。汉代的这个制度，县一级的正印官，就是一把手，大的县叫县令，小的县叫县长，县令和县长有两个副手，一个叫
丞，一个叫尉，丞负责的是民政、财政，尉负责的是军事、治安。但是洛阳是一个大县，它是首县，所以它的尉不是一个人，曹操是担任洛阳
尉当中的一个，负责北部地区的治安，叫洛阳北部尉，他的级别是秩四百石，也就是说曹操担任的是一个副县级的公安局长。
这个官是曹操担任的第一个官职，所以曹操对于这件事记忆非常地深刻，后来曹操被汉献帝封为魏王，已经是王爵了，他还记得这件事，
他还记得推荐他担任洛阳北部尉的这个人，这个人是谁呢？这个人叫司马防，是司马懿的父亲。曹操担任魏王以后，就把司马防请到了他魏王
王国的都城邺城，摆开盛宴，款待司马防。酒过三巡以后曹操就想起这件事来了，就跟司马防说，司马公，你看看孤王今天还可不可以再去当
一次洛阳北部尉啊？这里面是有一点小人得志的嘴脸啊。司马芳说什么呢，司马防说大王啊，当年老夫推荐你去做洛阳北部尉的时候，你做那
个副县级的公安局长正合适啊！曹操听了以后哈哈哈哈，史书上的记载是曹操大笑。曹操为什么笑呢？那么一般的人认为这就是小人得志了，
自鸣得意了。不完全是这样。因为曹操这个时候想起了他当年担任洛阳北部尉的那些往事。
洛阳北部尉这个职务是不好担任的，为什么呢，洛阳是京都所在，是帝国的心脏啊，这个地方满城都是冠盖，都是权贵，这些权贵和他们
的家属，和他们的子弟，和他们的仆人，从来都是横行霸道的，从来就是不把王法放在眼里的，从来就是要为非作歹的，也从来就是没有人惹
的起的。可是首都地区的治安是不能不维护的，怎么办呢？所以非得有一个特殊的人，这个人得不信邪，这个人还得有很多鬼点子，能够治住
这些权贵，必须有这样的人去担任那个副县级的公安局长才镇得住这个地方。而曹操恰恰是这样一个人，胆子又大，点子又多，谁都不怕，愣
头青一个，所以说他去当这个副县级的公安局长那是非常的合适。司马防这个话还不完全是给自己打圆场，确实还是实事求是。
事实上曹操担任的副县级的公安局长，洛阳北部尉以后不辱使命。曹操上任以后，看见这个衙门破败不堪，一看这公安局就是不管事的，
自己办公室都没有打扫干净。曹操做的第一件事是装修，先把咱公安局装修一遍，像模像样；然后做了十几根五色大棒，挂在县衙门两边；然
后贴出一个告示来说，现在是我曹操主管这个工作了，我把我们帝国的这个法令重申一遍，一二三四五六七，哪些是不可以做的，然后谁要是
违反了法令，五色棒伺候。然后自己就坐在衙门里，准备审案子，果然就来了个不怕死的。因为这些权贵他哪里把王法放在眼里，他横行霸道
惯了，来了个什么不怕死的呢？蹇硕的叔叔蹇图，蹇硕是什么人，蹇硕是当今圣上最宠爱的宦官，权重一时，炙手可热，所以他的叔叔也不把
什么法令呐衙门呐放在眼里，公然违禁在晚上走，喝醉了就在街上走。当时发布了戒严令，也叫宵禁令，就是晚上是不能在外面走来走去。他
不但晚上在外面走而且是喝醉了酒，被曹操手下抓了进来，曹操升堂：蹇图，知罪吗？蹇图这个时候大概酒也醒了，哎呀，好像是不是犯了宵
禁令哪？曹操说对了，知道怎么惩罚吗？蹇图说这个我就不大想得起来了，要不你问问我侄子？曹操说你侄子是谁呀？蹇硕呀！曹操说我不认
识，我谁也不认识，我只认得法律，不知道该怎么惩罚吧？本官告诉你，乱棍打死，来啊，打。打死了，就把这个当时最牛的宦官的叔叔就在
堂下当场打死。
［画话音］曹操是聪明的，所以他才会想出五色大棒的施政策略；曹操胆子大，所以他才敢秉公执法，棒杀蹇图。在这里，曹操的能臣形
象跃然纸上。但是，聪明的曹操难道不知道棒杀蹇图有可能葬送他的政治前途吗？易中天先生又是如何看待曹操杀气腾腾的这一棒呢？
曹操这一棒是打得所有的人目瞪口呆，不知道这个二十岁的小伙子他要干什么！因为谁都知道一个年轻人刚刚走入官场就得罪权贵他是没
有好下场的，这个道理难道曹操他不懂？蹇图是蹇硕的叔叔，这个关系难道曹操不知道？更让人想不通的是，曹操的祖父——实际上是应该说
是养祖父——这个曹腾他也是宦官，太监的孙子打死了太监的叔叔你说这事怎么说啊？所有人都想不通。那么曹操为什么要这样做呢？
第一种可能，曹操要一鸣惊人，有没有证据呢？有一点旁证，曹操后来写过一篇文章叫《述志令》，又叫《让县自明本志令》，他一开始
就说了这样的话：
“孤始举孝廉，年少，自以本非岩穴知名之士，恐为海内人之所见凡愚。欲为一郡守，好作政教，以建立名誉，使世士明知之。”
这段话什么意思呢？就是曹操回忆起他二十岁举孝廉的那个时代，他说我那个时候很清楚，我年纪太轻，又没有什么名气，恐怕大家都认
为我是一个没有用的人，所以我当时就想做一个好官，做一点惊天动地的事情让大家知道我曹操还是蛮能干的。实际上这个时候的曹操应该说
条件是不太好，一个是出身不好，是个太监的家庭，这个让士人的家庭就是那些不是太监家庭的那些人是不大看得起的。第二呢年纪太轻，只
有二十岁。第三呢，名声不好，因为曹操小时候是调皮捣蛋、飞鹰走狗、游手好闲、不务正业，专门做一些胡作非为的事，名声也不太好。另
外估计形象也不是太好。
我们去读《三国志》，但凡是形象好的，《三国志》上都有记载，比方说周瑜啊，诸葛亮啊这些人《三国志》上都有记载。而对于曹操的
容貌、长相，《三国志》是没有一个字的，《三国志》它是以魏为正统的，如果曹操的形象高大魁梧、英俊潇洒，它肯定大书特书，避而不谈
说明形象恐怕不怎么样。那么其他的史书对他的形象有描述，据其他的史书记载曹操叫做容貌短小，就是个子不高，估计也跟我差不多，和那
个一米八四的诸葛亮比起来就基本上属于不太合格的产品，残次品一类。另外《世说新语》里面有一个故事，就说曹操当了魏王以后，匈奴派
使节来见曹操，曹操自惭形秽，说自己这个矮小的个子不足雄远国，因此请崔琰代替他穿上魏王的服饰，坐在魏王的椅子上接见匈奴的来使，
自己拿了一把刀站在旁边。结果接见完了以后，曹操就派人去问匈奴的使节了，你感觉怎么样，匈奴使节说魏王确实十一表人才，不过他旁边
那个拿刀的，捉刀的那个人那是英雄。可见一个英雄倒不一定高大英俊，关键是在他的气度。
问题是曹操这个人这个时候还谈不上气度，所以他必须有一件惊天动地的事情才能扬名立万，棒杀蹇硕的叔叔就是一个扬名立万的好机会
。这是第一种猜测。
那么第二种猜测，就是曹操要严明法纪。曹操这个人是主张法治的，他执法非常之严，令行禁止，不容含糊，这个性格可能在他年轻的时
候就表现出来了。曹操这个重法治有两个原因，一个是形势所迫，一个是性格使然。所谓形势所迫，因为当时是一个乱世，乱世用重典，乱世
就得严，这是形势所迫。另外曹操这个人哪，他也是很严肃的。曹操生活上确实很随便，吃不讲究，穿不讲究，长期在外行军打仗对于女人估
计也不能讲究只能将就。但是他的这种性格并不意味着他轻浮，很多人认为曹操是个轻浮的人这是看错人了，曹操确实是说笑话、听音乐、穿
便服、作诗词，那是他紧张工作之余的一种放松，也是他内心世界丰富的表现，说不定还是他迷惑敌人的烟雾弹，你要把曹操当做轻浮的人那
你就错了。曹操其实是很深沉的人，曹操身上也是有杀气的，这种杀气就在这一棒就体现出来了。
当然还有一种可能，那就是碰巧，这个时候的曹操因为刚刚出道，二十岁还不太懂得官场，是个生瓜蛋子。以为他当了一个副县级的公安
局长就怎么了不起了，他放出话来谁敢违令格杀勿论，结果蹇图这个大尾巴狼撞上来了，说出去的话泼出去的水，只好硬着头皮把他打死。
但是不管哪一种猜测，我们可以肯定，我们无法准确知道曹操当时的想法，但是可以准确知道的是曹操这一下把权贵是得罪了，把宦官集
团也得罪了。但是宦官集团拿他没有办法，因为第一，曹操是对的，执法如山嘛，你有什么话说。第二，曹操有后台。那么宦官集团想了一个
什么办法呢，就跟皇帝说，皇上，曹操可是个人才，执法如山啊，让他当个副县级的公安局长委屈了，应该升为正县级，但是调到边远地区。
升你一级你给我滚，别在我跟前晃。于是曹操就担任了顿丘令，没过多久曹操又被朝廷调回来，担任议郎，议郎是什么概念呢，用现在的话说
就是调研员，是个闲差；然后后来又派到地方上，又调回来当议郎。曹操想了，议郎就议郎吧，我就好好调研吧，到地方上就到地方上吧，我
就好好执政吧，可是怎么样呢？曹操把他治国的方略，以及对当前政治的一些建议写成文章交上去，泥牛入海无消息，根本没人搭理。他在地
方上打击豪强，整顿秩序，如以卵击石，蚍蜉撼树，根本没有什么大的效果。
曹操到地方上执政也是很严厉的，据说是给曹操的调令一下，比方说把曹操调到去当济南相，当地大大小小的权贵闻风遁逃啊，说曹操来
了我们在这个地方还能呆啊？窜入他郡，都跑别的地方去了。小报告一封一封地送达御前，不停地有人去告曹操的刁状。这个时候曹操感到，
他在官场上恐怕是混不下去了，他感觉到大汉王朝已江河日下，这个政权也行将就木，他做的任何努力都无济于事，只会给自己招来祸灾。之
所以没有惹出杀身之祸来，是因为他有曹嵩这个大后台，他的父亲官居太尉，也就是当时名义上的三军总司令，权贵还不敢把他怎么样。但是
长此以往，是肯定没有好果子吃的，于是曹操谢绝了朝廷的再一次任命，这次是任命他做两千石，级别两千石的东郡太守，曹操辞掉了这个任
务，借口自己有病，然后回到了自己的家乡，闭门读书，闲暇的时候打打猎来娱乐自己。但是曹操并没有忘记国家大事，他仍然关心着自己的
国家和民族。
［画话音］通过易中天先生的分析可以看出，年轻的曹操的确是个“治世能臣”，不管是做拥有实权的洛阳北部尉，还是做虚职的议郎，
曹操都尽职尽责。然而当时权归当道，使他空有以腔报国热情却难以施展，最终曹操托病辞官。曹操难道不想做能臣了吗？做能臣究竟需要什
么条件呢？
实际上呢，年轻的曹操可能还不懂得一个道理，就是做一个能臣是要有条件的，什么条件呢？第一，要看时世，只有在治世才可能做能臣
，如果在乱世，那恐怕就只能像诸葛亮《出师表》说的那样，“苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯”；第二呢，要看政局，政局如果混乱那也
是做不成能臣的，连孔子都说邦有道则智、邦无道则愚，什么叫愚呢，就是装傻，比装疯含蓄一点；第三要看人主，就是这个皇帝是个昏君呢
还是个明君，如果是昏君你也做不成能臣；第四，即便是治世、是明君、是一个好的政局，那你还要看皇帝的心情和兴趣。比方说汉文帝，那
不是昏君，汉文帝的时代也是西汉王朝最好的时代，号称文景之治，汉文帝也非常欣赏贾谊这个人，应该说是贾谊做能臣的条件都具备了，但
是怎么样了最后？“可怜夜半虚前席，不问苍生问鬼神”，还是不用他，最后把他打发到长沙，害得贾谊终日以泪洗面哭死在那里。所以做能
臣是要有条件的，而曹操所处的那个时代不具备这个条件。
曹操出仕的时候，还不能算是乱世，但已经是乱世的前夜。曹操这个出仕是在汉灵帝时期，而灵帝和桓帝，和他的叔叔桓帝，这两朝是政
治最黑暗腐败的代名词，一提起最坏的时代：桓、灵两朝。所以诸葛亮最后的《出师表》不是说嘛，未尝不叹息痛恨于桓灵也。那么灵帝是一
个什么样的人呢，他的兴趣在哪里，他的兴趣不在国家大事，在文学艺术，据说灵帝辞赋是写得很好的，对建筑艺术也有研究。他当时在宫殿
里研究什么呢，研究自来水和排水系统，在宫殿里设计了一整套上下水系统，非常之好。成功以后灵帝又下令说，要让老百姓都喝上自来水，
于是在京城里面大动土木。这个你是皇帝啊，你要管的是天下的兴亡，不是上下水，那么朝政交给谁呢？两拨人：外戚、宦官。而且这个灵帝
他因为要做这么多事情，他要有钱，钱从哪里来，卖官。灵帝朝是卖官的，而且明码实价、公开招标。价钱大概是级别一石是一万，比方说你
要买一个四百石的副县级的官做，四百万；你要买一个两千石的正部级的官做，两千万；如果你想位列三公，就是太尉、司徒、司空，再加一
千万，明码实价。这是公开买卖，如果朝廷的正式任命也要交钱，不过可以只交一半或者三分之一，可以讲价。
当时有一个叫司马直的人被任命为巨鹿太守，委任状一到，朝廷就伸手，拿钱来。司马直说，我哪儿有钱，我是个清官。朝廷说知道，你
生活困难，减免三百万，你交。司马直说我实在交不起，这个官我不做了行不行？朝廷说那不行，你不能辞官啊！司马直没有办法，只好在上
任的路上自杀，临终前写下一份遗书，痛斥朝廷卖官，实在是祸国殃民，是亡国的象征！
但是司马直我们现在看来是白死了，因为司马直死了以后朝廷卖官变本加厉。曹操的父亲曹嵩官居太尉，都是花钱买的，太尉是三公啊，
地位崇高啊，所以很多人都想去过一把三公的瘾，其中就包括一个叫崔烈的。崔烈也是个清官，家庭素有清名，靠着自己的工作努力当了郡守
，当了九卿，但是他总觉得我们崔家该出个三公。正好这个时候皇帝的一个保姆姓程，路程的程，程夫人跑来跟崔烈说，哎，我可以搞到内部
优惠价。崔烈说，优惠价是多少。五折。崔烈想这五折还是合算哪，就交了五折的钱。交了以后，哎果然皇帝就开会，正式宣布任命崔烈为司
徒。话说完了以后，你看皇帝昏到了什么程度，他说哎呀，你这才交了一半的钱啊，这个帝国做了一次赔本的买卖。他这个话音刚落程夫人不
干了，程夫人马上跳出来说，崔大人是个好官，他的官怎么是花钱买的呢，是我帮他弄来的嘛。公卿哗然，说你这个崔烈靠女人弄个官来你还
不如花钱买呢你，更没面子。
在这种情况下，曹操把当时的官场和朝廷都看透了，他不再提意见，也不再担任任何官职。他觉得在这段时间自己应该好好地学习，提高
自己的修养，为将来能够为国家尽忠尽力的时候做一个准备。等到曹操再次出山的时候，政局已经混乱不堪了。公元189年，汉灵帝驾崩，留下
两个儿子，十四岁的刘辩，和九岁的刘协，再加上刘辩的母亲何皇后，孤儿寡母根本控制不了局面。以大将军何进为首的士人集团，与宦官集
团展开了激烈的斗争和宫廷政变，两败俱伤。最后政权落到了西北军阀董卓的手里。
董卓这一伙人在当时的士大夫看来，那简直就不是人。董卓是虎，吕布是狼，他们的手下是野狗。董卓进京以后干了什么？废立皇帝。他
首先把在任的皇帝，就是那个十四岁的刘辩把他废掉，立那个九岁的陈留王刘协为皇帝，这是他一件事。第二，秽乱后宫，把先帝留下的女人
全部收编了。第三，就是屠杀百官。据说当时董卓最大的兴趣就是大宴宾客，把朝中的文武百官都请来喝酒，他自己公然地当着百官的面搂着
先帝留下的女人寻欢作乐，然后随机地从赴宴的大臣当中挑一个出去打死，或者是把反对他的人，被他抓来的那些反对他的人，当场拖过来挖
眼睛，砍手，削鼻子，扔在这个汤锅里煮，听他们惨叫，这些人越是惨叫，他的食欲和性欲就越旺盛。他的手下则在洛阳城里烧杀掠抢，奸淫
妇女，整个首都变成了惨绝人寰的重灾区。
董卓的这种倒行逆施和胡作非为当然要引起公愤。当时的情况是怎么样的呢？当时的情况是各州、郡的州牧、太守、刺史，他们都已经有
了自己的地盘和军队，朝廷已经不大指挥得动他们了。在这样的一个情况下，帝国的州、郡就宣布成立义军讨伐董卓。也就是说，在公元189年
董卓入京以后，东汉王朝在事实上已经灭亡了，虽然在名义上还没有灭亡。天下从此大乱。乱世英雄起四方，有枪就是草头王。这些拥有自己
军队的州牧、刺史、太守们开始了地方割据、诸侯兼并。在这样的一个时局下，曹操肯定是做不成能臣了，因为他遇到的是乱世。实际上在乱
世呢，也有三种选择，可以做乱世英雄，可以做乱世枭雄，可以做乱世奸雄。董卓、袁绍、袁术的选择是做乱世枭雄，那么曹操的选择是什么
呢？请看下集。
在《能臣之路》节目当中，易中天先生从曹操到底是“治世之能臣”还是“乱世之奸雄”展开了多方位的分析。在易中天先生看来，曹操本来的志向是想做一个“治世之能臣”，可是在那个乱世年代，随着中央政权失控，军阀割据一方，曹操的能臣之路肯定是走不下去了。这时，他的人生道路就面临着新的选择，那么曹操的选择是做什么呢？厦门大学易中天教授将从当代视角为我们精彩品读三国——何去何从。

易中天：

我们知道曹操再一次被朝廷招回来的时候，灵帝已经死了。灵帝死了以后，朝局大乱，董卓入京把持了朝政。董卓入京以后他也很明白一个道理，他自己带来的西北军，那是一群土匪，搞破坏可以，搞建设是不行的。要搞建设，要得天下，还得依靠东汉王朝原来的那些官员和将领。于是董卓他也拉拢人才，集中就包括曹操，董卓任命曹操为骁骑校尉。这个时候曹操的政治远见、政治敏锐和政治眼光就表现出来了，曹操一眼就看穿了，追随董卓的结果只能是祸国殃民和自取灭亡。于是曹操就从京城里逃了出来，准备逃回老家。

曹操走到陈留，陈留就在现在开封市的东南面，历来是兵家必争之地，他在这个地方停下来了。为什么呢，他得到陈留一个叫卫兹的人赞助，这个卫兹大概是家里很有钱的，赞助了曹操一大笔钱财，这件事情是非常重要的，而且历来不太被人注意。就是三国时代的那些英雄，比方说曹操，比方说刘备，他们能够起兵，能够成为一方诸侯，都是得到财团赞助的，而且这个地方财团通过资助他们认为的英雄人物来参与政治，是中国传统社会的一个政治传统。那么曹操得到了卫兹的赞助以后就在当地招兵买马，最后公开打出旗号，要成立义军讨伐董卓，这是曹操成为“乱世英雄”做的第一件事情：“首倡义兵”。曹操的这个倡议得到了天下英雄的响应，各路诸侯各路豪杰纷纷起兵，举起义旗，要讨伐董卓，匡复汉室。

公元190年，后将军袁术、冀州牧韩馥、豫州刺史孔伷、兖州刺史刘岱、河内太守王匡、渤海太守袁绍、陈留太守张邈、东郡太守桥瑁、山阳太守袁遣、济北相鲍信同时起兵，组成联军，并公推袁绍为盟主。这支军队由于他们的驻地都在函谷关以东，因此被称为“关东义军”，也叫“关东联军”，简称“关东军”。而董卓的部队则叫做“西北军”。曹操被“关东盟军”的盟主袁绍任命为“奋武将军”。

［画话音］曹操欣然接受了“奋武将军”的称号，因为据易中天先生分析，曹操从公元174年出山，到公元189年起兵，他一直是向做能臣的。这次，曹操接受这个称号，本来是想为国家、为民族做点大事，可是就在他准备为实现自己的理想而赴汤蹈火的时候，却感到了报国无门。那么，曹操究竟看到了什么而使他如此失望呢？

首先是“关东军”的盟主首领袁绍徒有其表。袁绍这个人被推为盟主也是有道理的，第一，袁绍出身高贵，他的家族号称“四世三公”，什么叫“四世三公”呢？就是他这个家族有四代人连续地担任了“三公”的职务，我们知道在汉代“三公”这个职务的地位是很高的，仅次于皇帝的可谓“一人之下万人之上”。袁家一连四代人，就是袁绍以上太祖、高祖、祖、父这四辈都有出任这样官职的人，那在官场上是炙手可热的显赫家族啊。第二，袁绍自己一表人才，长得非常漂亮，聪明伶俐能说会道，也善于处理人际关系，和当时的名流、士大夫都有来往。更重要的是袁绍因为反对董卓，而声名大振。

董卓进京以后就琢磨着换皇帝，他要废掉当时的皇帝刘辩，立陈留王刘协为帝，因此找袁绍商量。为什么找袁绍商量呢，因为袁绍的叔叔当时是太傅，于是董卓就想让袁绍传话给他的叔叔，请他的叔叔来支持一下这个事情。当场遭到袁绍的拒绝，这个皇帝怎么能随便换呢，皇帝就是你换的吗？董卓这个土匪勃然大怒，就骂袁绍，臭小子，竖子，天下的事难道不是我说了算吗？你以为我董卓的刀不快吗？当时袁绍是军官，按照制度军官开会是可以带刀的，董卓把刀拔出来这么一骂，袁绍唰一把把刀拔出来，一把横过来横在胸前，刀刃对外刀背对内，说天底下难道只有董大人的刀是快的吗？然后后退，退出会场，连夜逃出京城。那么这件事情裴松之在给《三国志》做注的时候认为这不是事实，《三国志》的记录也不是这样的，《三国志》的记录是袁绍对这个董卓说，那我回去跟叔叔说说，然后就跑掉了。反正袁绍确实是反对了董卓的，这个是事实。所以让他来做讨伐董卓的“关东联军”的盟主还是有道理的。

但是袁绍这个人没有政治头脑。董卓是怎么入京的，就是他袁绍弄来的。因为当时汉灵帝去世以后，士人集团和宦官集团在一个问题上发生冲突，就是谁来坐下一任的皇帝。汉灵帝是想立刘协的，就是小儿子，而且把这个事情交待给了当时西园八军的上军校尉蹇硕。而刘辩是汉灵帝的皇后何皇后所生，何皇后当然是希望他的儿子来当皇帝，而何皇后的哥哥，就是当时的大将军何进。大将军是真正的一人之下、万人之上，“三公”那个时候已经是名誉职务了，掌实权的是大将军。所以这两个集团就为这个事情打将起来，那么第一回合，士人集团取胜，上军校尉蹇硕被何进杀掉，何进接管了上军。这个时候袁绍就给何进出了一个主意，说既然如此我们乘胜追击，把所有的太监统统杀个一干二净，从此天下太平。这个何进是有点动心的，因为何进是什么出身呢，屠夫，本来就是个杀猪的。但是何进的妹妹何太后不同意，何太后为什么不同意呢，因为当年何太后毒杀了刘协的生母王美人，就是那个小儿子是一个叫王美人的这么一个级别地位比较低的女人生的，生了以后何太后给她送了一杯酒给王美人喝，王美人喝了就死了。汉灵帝勃然大怒要废皇后，是宦官们跪下来求情才保住了何太后的皇后地位，所以何太后就不愿意对太监下手。这时候袁绍又给何进出了一个主意，说那就请董卓进京，让董卓来吓唬一下何太后。这是一个地地道道的馊主意，老百姓都知道请神容易送神难，何况你请来的还是凶神。

这个事情当时曹操得到消息以后，哈哈大笑，曹操是非常喜欢笑的。曹操呵呵呵呵，哈呀，犯得着吗？不就是几个太监吗，几个宦官吗？太监和宦官为什么能够得势？那是皇上宠信他们，皇上不宠信他们他们能怎么样啊？当然不错了，有几个太监是很坏的，是要整治整治的，派一个刑事警察去就够了，“何必纷纷召外将乎”？我们从这个事情就可以看出来这个曹操和袁绍这两个人的政治水平了，曹操的观点很简单呐，杀鸡焉用牛刀，何况这把刀还不在你的手上，兵者凶器也，刀是不能随便出鞘的，刀出鞘，就要见血，没有鸡杀就要杀牛。何进、袁绍这是该着被杀的，犟牛，蠢牛，结果怎么样呢？董卓还没有进京，何进就先被太监杀了，何进被太监杀了以后袁绍再带着军队打过去再去杀太监，杀得一塌糊涂以后，董卓这个虎、这个狼就来了。再来杀他们。

是的，政治斗争是要先下手为强，那不等于到处树敌呀！最严重的打击只能施于最顽固和最凶残的敌人。所以正确的做法是团结大多数，打击一小撮，首恶必办，胁从不问。你怎么能把太监统统杀光呢？再说太监里面也有好人嘛。但是袁绍是怎么杀的呢，袁绍下一道命令，凡是没长胡子的就杀，弄得洛阳城里面那些还没来得及长出胡子的小伙子见了袁绍的军队就脱裤子验明正身。所以曹操硕我预见他一定会失败。

这个盟主是这样一个人，其他的人呢，也不咋地。比方说孔伷，是个夸夸其谈的，史书上的说法说他是“嘘枯吹生”，什么叫“嘘枯吹生”呢，就是能把死的说成活的，能把活的说成死的，反正是特能说，可惜不能干。又比方说济州牧韩馥，那是个没注意的，当时桥瑁写信给韩馥，说曹操那边已经起了义兵，我们也准备起义兵，大家联合起来去对付董卓。一封信写到韩馥这里，韩馥居然拿出来问大家说，你看，这个董卓和袁绍他们要打起来了，我们是帮董卓啊还是帮袁绍啊？居然问这样的问题。结果他手下一个谋士叫做刘子惠的，马上就顶回去说，我们起兵是为了国家，怎么要问是为了袁绍还是董卓呀！一句话说得这个韩馥满脸通红，“那为之奈何”啊，刘子惠就跟他出了个主意说，按兵不动，“兵者凶器也，不可为首”，啊，做人不要为天下先，枪打出头鸟，出头的椽子是先烂的，我们看一看人家怎么样，人家动咱也动，人家不动咱也不动。看来这个刘子惠也不咋的，但这个话韩馥他听进去了，因为韩馥他最怕的是丢地盘，因为韩馥是在冀州，冀州这个地方是很富庶的在当时，据说冀州当时的粮食足够吃十年的，所以韩馥最怕人家来墙他的地盘，尤其怕袁绍。

袁绍从这个京城里逃出来的时候，董卓准备是要追杀袁绍的，这个时候京城里面有几位名士跟袁绍关系很好，就去劝董卓。说大人不要这样，这个袁绍他是个年轻人，他不懂事，他不识大体，一不小心得罪了您老人家他又害怕，他当然要跑嘛，他没有别的意思，但是袁氏家族的“四世三公”门生故吏遍天下，您不如任命他做一个太守，他必然会感恩戴德，袁绍如果对董大人您感恩戴德，那么太行山以东不都是阁下的了吗？哎董卓说这有道理啊，好，任命他做渤海太守，就任命袁绍做渤海太守。袁绍当时逃出来以后逃到哪儿，逃到冀州，韩馥马上就紧张了，袁绍来了，还是渤海太守，怎么办呢，抢我地盘来了。韩馥马上派兵把袁绍看起来，直到最后“关东联军”成立，袁绍当了盟主，韩馥才把袁绍放出去让他行动。韩馥就是这么一个玩意，你说他怎么回去打头阵？

其他人也差不多，他们虽然组织了一直联军，谁也不愿意冲锋陷阵，都在观望。曹操看不下去了，曹操对他们说了这样的话：

“举义兵以诛暴乱，大众已合，诸君何疑？”

就是说我们成立这样一支义军，而且已经联合起来了，你们还有什么可怀疑的？而且曹操跟大家说，现在是消灭董卓最好的时候，为什么呢？这个时候董卓已经把洛阳城烧了，然后把皇上西迁到长安。曹操说了，如果过去董卓还在洛阳京城的时候，手上有皇上，我们去打他不大讲得过去；但是他现在已经把我们的首都都烧毁，把皇上都劫持了，按现在的话说那就可以定位为恐怖组织了，已经天下震动了，不得人心了。这个时候我们只要跟他决一死战，一战而天下可定。但是没有人听他的，曹操说好吧，好吧，你们不打我自己去吧，自己带了一支部队西进。这个时候只有张邈表示同情，派了一支小部队也随着曹操西进。但是这个时候曹操的实力是非常的弱小，根本不是董卓那个“西北军”的对手，所以一败涂地，曹操自己本人差一点阵亡，是他的堂弟曹洪把马让给曹操，曹操才逃出来。当时最紧急的时候曹洪跟曹操说，天下可以没有我曹洪，不能没有哥哥你，骑上我的马，走吧！曹操才逃回了他们的大本营，大本营在酸枣。

等曹操带着一身的尘土、一身的血污回到酸枣大营的时候，看见大营里面的各路诸侯在干什么呢？“日置酒高会，不图进取”，也就是说整天都在开Party，泡酒吧，打电子游戏！曹操实在是忍无可忍，说国家民族已经到了这个份上，你们还居然天天都在喝酒！曹操悲愤地说：

“今兵以义动，持疑而不进，失天下之望，窃为诸君耻之！”

我为你们这些人感到耻辱！还是没有人听他的，曹操再一次感到了报国无门。

［画话音］曹操为什么再一次感到报国无门？因为曹操已经看出，当时那些割据一方的诸侯都是一些自私自利、胆小怕事、无所作为的人。东汉王朝已经不可救药，天下大乱已不可逆转。即使不乱，腐朽的朝廷和官场也不需要什么“治世之能臣”，所以曹操不得不重新选择他的人生道路。那么，曹操做后选择了一条什么路呢？

曹操的选择是自己干。

实际上对于曹操人生道路的选项历来是有两种说法，一种是大家比较熟悉的许劭说的“治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄”；另一种说法见于《世说新语》，据说是桥玄说的，说法是“乱世之英雄，治世之奸贼”。所以当曹操处于乱世的时候，他其实是有两个选项的：一个是英雄，一个是奸雄。但是我认为至少，从公元190年到公元200年这十年当中，曹操不愧为“乱世之英雄”。因为只有曹操才用自己微弱的一己之躯担负起天下的兴亡。如果说还有人的话，那就是孙权的父亲孙坚，但是孙坚的谋略显然不如曹操。

那么在这十年间曹操干了些什么事呢？三件事：一是略地，二是募兵，三是屯田。这三件事情都与黄巾起义有关系，那么黄巾起义我们知道是地地道道的官逼民反，但是在曹操他们看来，却是必须予以剿灭的反贼。在这个天下大乱的时候，黄巾军趁着帝国的官僚、将领、诸侯们争权夺利的时候发展壮大起来了，于是在公元192年聚集在青州的黄巾军进入了兖州，兖州刺史刘岱不听鲍信的劝告，结果被黄巾军所杀。这个时候鲍信和陈宫就请曹操来代理兖州牧，曹操代理兖州牧以后就跟黄巾军作战，最后战败了黄巾军，黄巾军向曹操投降。这个黄巾军是个奇怪的军事组织，它并不是一个纯粹的部队，它还有随军的家属和农民，就是当时的青州的黄巾军战斗员是三十万，随军家属和农民加起来一共是一百万，而且还带着农具和耕牛。那么曹操接受了黄巾军投降以后，就把当中能打仗的人把他编成一队，叫做“青州兵”。代理了兖州牧，曹操就有了根据地；收编了青州军，曹操就有了战斗队。

但是曹操还有一个问题，就是这么多人你如何安置，如何养活？这个时候他的一个重要的谋士叫做毛玠，就向他提出了一个战略性的意见。毛玠说：“今天下分崩，国主迁移，民生废业，饥馑流亡，公家无经岁之储，百姓无安国之志，难以持久。今袁绍、刘表虽士民众强，皆无经远之虑，未有树基建本者也，夫兵义者胜，守位以财，宜奉天子以令不臣。修耕植，畜军资，如此则霸王之业可成也。”

毛玠的这一段话，我认为可以称之为曹操版的“隆中对”，他是从一个很高的角度对曹操提出了一种战略性的意见。毛玠说现在国家的局势是什么样的？天下大乱，四分五裂，国本动摇，皇帝被人劫持着走过来走过去，经济崩溃，所有的老百姓都不能安居乐业，灾难流行，又是天灾又是人祸。那么在这样的一个情况下，最重要的就是做这样一件事情：第一要把现任皇帝把他安定下来，国本就保住了，然后自己发展自己的实力。毛玠的这个曹操版的“隆中对”世纪上讲出了这样两个道理，就是在这样一个动乱的时代你要成就一番事业，也就是他所说的霸王之业，必须有两个条件：一是正义，二是实力。而实力当中首先是经济实力，战争确实拼的是武力，但是战争武力比拼的背后是经济实力的支撑，之有足够的经济实力来支持，你这场战才能打得久，才能打得赢，所谓“兵马未动，粮草先行”嘛，所以你必须修耕植、蓄军资。除了经济实力的比拼以外，战争作为政治的延续，还要比拼政治实力，政治实力靠什么呢？靠正义的旗帜，你必须表现自己是师出有名，是堂堂正正的正义之师，至少你必须有一面正义的旗帜。

所以毛玠的这个建议是一个纲领性的文件，包括三个内容：“奉天子”，就是整治策略；“修耕植”，就是发展农业生产，这是经济策略；“蓄军资”，这是军事策略。这番话说下来以后，曹操非常地高兴，《三国志》用了四个子，叫做“敬纳其言”，马上实行。

公元196年，曹操开始屯田，当时因为连年的战争，许多土地都已经没有业主了，也没有人耕种。曹操说，好嘛，无主田亩收归国有，统统收给他自己的政府所有。然后把这些田地拿出来一部分交给自己的军队和黄巾军投降的那些士兵去耕种，叫做军屯，还有一部分招募了那些失地的农民，那些流民来耕种叫民屯。耕牛和农具是由政府提供，然后军人和农民向政府交五成到六成的地租，这个就叫做屯田。屯的意思就是居住方式军事化，耕作方式集体化。也就是说，曹操建设了一个古代的生产建设兵团，曹操的军政府就变成了农场主。这是一个非常高明的政策，也是一笔非常合算的买卖：第一，土地是人家丢下来的，耕牛和农具是从黄巾军那里缴获的，曹操没有一点本钱的投入，叫做无本生意；第二点，收五成到六成的地租，这是高利啊，因为汉代初年定下的地租是十五分之一，后来收得最少的时候甚至到了三十分之一，你现在变成了二分之一，暴利，但是对于士兵和农民来说现在有饭吃了，总比原来饿肚子好，所以大家也愿意；第三，屯田制度是居住方式军事化、耕作方式集体化，这就等于建设了一个军民合一的新社会，和一支耕战合一的新军队，这些人平时能干，急时能战，既是兵源，又是粮库，岂不是一举两得，而且还解决了一个让人头疼的流民问题，这岂不是一举多得。

曹操的屯田制，证明他不愧为一个深谋远虑的政治家。曹操在颁布他的《屯田令》的时候说了这样一句话，他说：“定国之术，在于强兵足食。”就说怎样才能平定天下呢？第一要强兵，第二要足食，兵不强、(食不足)你何以得天下？而其他的那些诸侯就没有这个战略眼光，后来《魏书》有这么一段话：

“诸军并起，无终岁之计，饥则寇略，饱则弃馀，瓦解流离，无敌自破者不可胜数。”

这话什么意思呢？就是说在天下大乱、诸侯并起的时候，除了曹操，没有一支军队有一个长远的打算。“饥则寇略”，肚子饿了就去抢老百姓的，“饱则弃馀”，吃饱了以后就把多余的粮食都扔了。最后是什么呢？最后是不攻自破，因为你如果断了粮你就没有战斗力了。实际上就在曹操的军队丰衣足食的时候，袁绍的军队在河北吃桑椹，袁术的军队在江南吃河蚌，没有桑椹和河蚌吃的，就吃人。我们去读《三国志》可以多处发现这样的字眼，大灾人相食，蝗虫起人相食，人饥相食，人吃人啊。那样的军队怎么可能会有战斗力呢？这样的人怎么可能和曹操争雄？和这样的人相比曹操又怎么可能不是英雄？

从“首倡义兵”到“屯田备战”，曹操在战争中已经由一个血气方刚的青年将领成长为一个深谋远虑的政治高手。其他那些和他一起起兵的那些人却没有什么长进和出息，他们或者明哲保身、畏首畏尾，或者醉生梦死、得过且过，或者心怀鬼胎、混水摸鱼，或者争权夺利、自相残杀。那边西北军还在肆虐，这边关东军已经火并；先是兖州刺史刘岱杀死了东郡太守桥瑁，后是渤海太守袁绍干掉了冀州牧韩馥。那么这个事情闹完了以后，接下来就是袁绍和袁术兄弟两个开始窝里斗，当时袁绍在北方，袁术在南方，袁术怎么做呢？袁术联络更北方的公孙瓒来牵制袁绍；袁绍怎么办呢？袁绍联络更南方的刘表来对付袁术，兄弟两个都“沅交近攻”，祸起萧墙。不过实在地说起来，袁绍和袁术兄弟两个最大的问题还不是窝里斗，也不是不懂得备战备荒的道理，更重要的是他们兄弟两个，包括董卓，都在一个重大政治问题上犯了严重的错误，那么这个重大的政治问题是什么呢？他们是怎样犯错误的？曹操在这个问题上又怎样表现出自己的远见卓识呢？请看下集，一错再错。
在上一集我们讲了当时的乱世枭雄们对待皇帝的三种态度和做法，第一种是董卓的，叫做废立，就是把现任皇帝废掉然后再立一个皇帝；第二种是袁绍的，叫另立，就是在现任皇帝之外他另外再立一个皇帝，当然这个没有得逞，未遂；第三种是袁术的做法，叫自立，自己当皇帝，失败了，那么这三种态度和做法他们共同的问题是成本高、风险大、效益低。相比较而言曹操就高明多了，曹操他不换皇帝，他利用这个现成的皇帝，而且把这个皇帝客客气气地供奉起来，利用皇帝这张牌来号令天下、号召诸侯，这个就是我们通常所说的“挟天子以令诸侯”。其实这个说法是可以讨论的，曹操本人和曹操集团的人从来没有说过“挟天子以令诸侯”。
［画话音］在《何去何从》一集中，易中天先生告诉我们，曹操的谋士毛玠曾经向他提出了一个建议：“奉天子以令不臣，修耕植以畜军资”，曹操采纳了谋士毛玠的建议，并予以实施。也就是说，曹操的路线和策略是“奉天子以令不臣”，而不是“挟天子以令诸侯”。那么，“挟天子以令诸侯”这一说法又是怎么来的呢？
“挟天子以令诸侯”这个说法是人家说曹操的，比方说诸葛亮就说过这个话，他的说法是“挟天子而令诸侯”，但意思一样的。也就是说“挟天子以令诸侯”这话是曹操的敌人说他的，敌人的话不怎么靠得住吧！那么“挟天子以令诸侯”有没有人说过呢？有，谁呢？袁绍的谋士沮授，叫做“挟天子而令诸侯，畜士马以讨不庭”，可是袁绍手下其他的谋士不赞成，说这个皇帝现在是个废物啊，这么一个废物你把他接到我们这儿来干什么呢？你是朝拜他呢还是不朝拜他呢？你是请示他呢还是不请示他呢？那你肯定要朝拜、要请示，我现在把他弄来以后大事小事我都要跟皇帝请示，皇帝万一意见和我们不一样怎么办呢？我是听他的呢还是不听他的呢？我听他的显得我们没分量，我不听他的我不又是违法吗？算了算了。袁绍怎么想呢？袁绍一想，这现任皇帝那是董卓扶起来的，而且董卓要废立皇帝的时候我袁绍是不干的，我现在又去尊奉他，我不是自己打自己耳光吗？当然我现在又不可能把我主张的那个皇帝再扶起来，那个已经被董卓谋杀了，拉倒吧。那么这个事情袁绍一犹豫，曹操就抢先了一步。
［画话音］公元196年，被董卓劫持到西安的汉献帝在董卓死后，历尽千辛万苦，又回到了当时的首都洛阳。这时的洛阳已经是一片废墟，破败不堪，在洛阳，皇帝和百官的饮食起居甚至形同乞丐。曹操在得到这一消息后，果断地采纳谋士毛玠“奉天子以令不臣”的建议，想方设法把皇帝从洛阳接到了自己的根据地许县。
曹操把汉献帝接到许县以后，立即就把自己的行辕腾了出来作为皇帝的行宫，客客气气地供奉起来，礼仪、礼节那是非常地到家，绝不像西北军阀那样子无法无天、吆三喝四。当年皇帝在从长安迁到洛阳的路上，每天他也是上朝的哩，就找一个农民的院儿，往当中一坐，大家都来行礼如仪。那些西北军的军阀、军官和士兵们都在农家院外面看着闹，啊，这皇帝上朝是这样的。这种事情到曹操这里是没有的，曹操完全按照汉官威仪、大汉王朝的礼仪中规中矩地来供奉这个皇帝，而且安排皇帝生活的时候做得非常地周到和细心，很像一个大管家的样子。最让皇帝感动的是什么呢？是曹操送来了大量急需的生活用品，你要知道这个皇帝他是个逃难的，他可能脸盆都没有，曹操把所有的这些东西都送来了，然后上了一份奏折，叫做《上杂物疏》。《上杂物疏》怎么说呢，说陛下，现在臣献上来的都是当年先帝赐给臣祖父和父亲的，御用的器皿，这些器皿臣的祖父和臣的父亲放在家里从来就没敢用过，那是先帝的恩德，我们是供奉在家里的，现在臣觉得应该还给皇上了。
这一手是做得非常漂亮的，我们知道做人情的诀窍在什么地方？做人情最重要的是千万不要让对方觉得你在做人情，不要让对方觉得欠了你的。我们很多人不会做人情，钱也没少花，还老提醒人家，你看我送了你什么东西啊。那么在这个时候皇帝已经是跟叫花子差不多，有人给他他就很感谢了，当然他还得摆个架子。那么其他的军阀有没有送东西的？有，叫做孝敬，但是你再孝敬那也是我孝敬的，这东西还是我的；曹操说这东西都不是我的，这东西本来就是皇上的，现在我是还给皇上，我是还东西，不是送东西。这样表面上看曹操一点人情都没有，皇帝用起来当之无愧、理直气壮，大家想想这是种什么样的心理感觉。汉献帝虽然是个傀儡皇帝，他不是糊涂人，他是明白人，他马上就明白了曹操的这样一份用心。当然这个时候我估计汉献帝是从好的方面去理解的，怎么理解的：大大的忠臣，这是天底下最难得的忠臣，看来我们汉家的这个国运恐怕是要仪仗曹某人了。这是我猜测的，我觉得这个猜测还是合逻辑的，他会产生这样一种感动和这样一种想法。
［画话音］曹操的殷勤让汉献帝十分感动，他任命曹操为大将军，这虽然是虚衔，但曹操得到了一面在当时看来是正义的旗帜。做事情师出有名，在政治上大大地捞了一把，这让其他诸侯十分眼红。那么，当时实力强大的诸侯袁绍又是如何对待这件事情的呢？
袁绍这个人的特点是什么呢？是反应慢，我们将来讲官渡之战的时候我还要讲这一点，袁绍和曹操比他的反应总是晚半拍。曹操一抢先袁绍反应过来了，反应过来以后仗着他人多势众，他也提出来说他也要迎奉皇帝，他说皇帝不能住在洛阳，洛阳已经被董卓毁掉了；也不能住在许县，许县那个地方不好，地势很低，很潮湿，我们皇上住那儿不舒服，应该把他移到甄城来，就是移到袁绍的地盘来，准备和曹操共享这一张王牌。曹操听了以后肚子里好笑，我到手的肥肉说分一口给你，有这么好的事吗？嘴巴上不能这样说，于是曹操用皇帝的名义下一道诏书，一本正经地教训了袁绍一番，说袁绍啊，你确实兵多将广，你也确实实力雄厚，那么朕流离失所的时候怎么没见到你来勤王啊？怎么一天到晚看见你不是发展自己的势力，就是攻击别人啊？你对大汉王朝的忠心何在啊？袁绍也清楚这个东西就是曹操写的，那不会是皇帝写的，但是是皇帝的名义盖了皇帝的印发出来，只好写一封检讨书。你说这不是政治上他又吃了一亏吗？
曹操抢先一步把皇帝从洛阳迎奉到许县以后，大家才恍然大悟，说曹操没有吃任何亏啊！他得到了很多的头衔，得到了很多的封地，得到了很多人的拥戴，更重要的是他得到了一面在当时看来是正义的旗帜。曹操现在干什么事都显得理直气壮了，至少是“显得”，他动不动都可以用皇帝的名义来下命令，来出兵，他师出有名了，他堂堂正正了。而且更重要的一点是，曹操奉天子之后，就把自己放在了一个政治上永远正确的这样一个不败之地，所有的政敌先不先，政治上先不正确了。当然了，按照中国传统政治的规矩，其他各路诸侯也可以提出一个口号，叫做“清君侧”，那皇帝身边有小人呐，小人就是曹操啊，我们去把他除了。那总不如曹操用皇帝的名义直接下诏，说你就是小人，它来得便当嘛。所以现在曹操不管干什么事情，是打击他的敌人也好，是任命他的亲信也好，他都可以用皇帝的这样一个名义，一个在当时看来正当的名义。因此在这一点上，曹操所有的敌人政治上矮了一头。后来就连诸葛亮作《隆中对》的时候跟刘备他也说了一句话，他说曹操“挟天子而令诸侯，此诚不可与争锋”，就是这一点我们确实是抵抗不了，诸葛亮都说抵抗不了。所以曹操这个举动在政治上大大地合算。
实际上我们看，毛玠的建议和沮授的建议表面上看起来是一样的，毛玠的建议是“奉天子以令不臣，修耕植以畜军资”，一条是尊奉天子，一条是发展实力；沮授的建议是什么呢，“挟天子而令诸侯，畜士马以讨不庭”，也是这个意思。但是你仔细一咂摸，这两条建议的格调是不一样的，毛玠的建议比沮授的建议格调高得多，高在哪里呢？他是奉天子，不是挟天子，“奉”是尊奉，是维护；“挟”是挟持，是利用，这岂可同日而语啊！所以格调上曹操就高了一招。即便我们退一万步说，就算曹操的想法和袁绍一样，或者说毛玠的意思和沮授一样，也是利用先任皇帝，那你先把这个牌拿到手，它在策略上也高了一招啊。王牌只有一张，谁抢先拿到手谁就是王，可惜袁绍不听。
［画话音］曹操抢先在袁绍的前面将皇帝迁到了自己的地盘，就可以利用皇帝这张牌来发展自己的力量，号令不肯臣服的诸侯。小说《三国演义》中也提到皇帝迁到许县后，朝廷大小事物都有曹操决断。那么在真实的历史中，通过尊奉天子，曹操真的能够顺利发展自己的力量，号令那些不肯臣服的诸侯吗？
不能。第一个，袁绍就不听他的。曹操当了大将军以后为了平衡，也知道袁绍这个人的实力很大，必须安抚一下，再说袁绍怎么说也是他小时候的哥们儿，于是建议皇帝任命袁绍做太尉。太尉是位居三公，是当时名义上的三军总司令。谁知道袁绍不干，跳起来了，什么，我袁绍做太尉，他曹操做大将军，那我上朝的时候站班排队我不是要排在他后边，哪有这个道理，曹操是什么玩意儿，曹操这个人我跟你们讲，他曹操这个人死了好几回了，都是我袁绍救他的，现在他倒爬到我头上来撒尿了，他想干什么！袁绍说了这样一句话：他难道想挟天子以令我吗？这是原文。袁绍这个话说得是一点意思都没有，你要知道当时就是大将军也好，什么太尉也好，司徒也好，老实说那都叫做徒有虚名，因为当时天下已经分崩离析，每个地方都是地方军阀在把持着的，朝廷的号令出去，反正这是叫不说白不说，说了也白说，就是那感觉。大将军和小将军是没有什么区别的，关键是你的地盘有多大，你何必要争这口气呢？
但是曹操却是很大度，曹操一看，觉得这个时候还不能够和袁绍公开翻脸。于是曹操上表，辞去大将军职务，让给袁绍，你不就想当大将军吗？我让给你。最后，皇帝说，好，那就让袁绍当大将军，老实说这时候皇帝也实在是一个做不了什么主的人。袁绍当了大将军他才不闹了，其实袁绍得了一个什么？得了一个面子，一点实惠都没有得到，他现在虽然官位在曹操之上，他谁也指挥不了，包括曹操。袁绍是想指挥一下曹操的，他给曹操写了一封信说，你现在不是在朝廷当中吗，你不是大权在握吗，你给我把两个人杀了，一个叫杨彪，一个叫孔融，给我杀了。袁绍和杨彪、孔融有过节，他想借刀杀人，曹操怎么会听他的。第一曹操很明白现在是收拾人心的时候，不是滥杀无辜的时候，曹操不是王允，曹操也不是袁绍，他绝对不会扩大打击面，根本现在就不是杀人的时候，何况还是杀名人。即便曹操要杀杨彪和孔融，坦率地说曹操也是不喜欢杨彪和孔融的，孔融最后也是被曹操杀掉的，但是要杀第一不是现在杀，第二也不是你袁绍让我杀我就杀，我什么时候想杀再杀。于是曹操一本正经地跟袁绍回一封信，袁兄啊，现在天下大乱，所有的人都是不安的，所有人都觉得自己是朝不保夕的，人人自危啊，“此上下相疑之秋也”，在这个时候我们执政，哪怕我们用最坦诚的心来对待大家恐怕大家还不相信我们呢，如果我们还随随便便地杀几个人，那人家不是更不相信我们了吗！不能这样做。袁绍碰一鼻子灰，浑身气都不打一出来，没话说。
［画话音］碰了一鼻子灰的袁绍是不了解曹操的真实想法，曹操迎奉天子到许县当然有自己的打算。小说《三国演义》中，提到曹操把皇帝迁到许县后，大权独揽，要“挟天子以令诸侯”。那么，历史上的曹操他的真实想法是这样吗？
我们现在也无法确切地知道曹操本人当时的想法，但是可以肯定一点，曹操的智囊团是主张奉天子的，其中最具有代表行的人物就是曹操的谋士荀彧。曹操前期五大谋士：荀彧、郭嘉、荀攸、贾诩、程昱，第一个就是荀彧。荀彧跟曹操也有一番对话，荀彧他谈到这样两个观点，他说第一点，当今之世，维护汉室、保卫皇帝就是一面正义的旗帜。第二点，将军您一贯正义，董卓造乱的时候，是将军您最先举起了正义的旗帜，叫首倡义兵；关东联军停滞不前的时候，是将军您最先出兵去攻打董卓；皇上颠沛流离的时候，是将军您派去了使节；皇帝回到洛阳的时候，是将军您把他接到了富庶的许县，这说明什么呢？说明将军您一贯就是维护王室、维护皇帝的，您的心无时无刻不在皇帝的身上。那么这个时候你应该趁这个机会赶紧把迎奉天子这件事情完成，如果等到将来我们这个国家真的四分五裂，天底下的人都有了诸侯割据一方的心思的时候，那就为时太晚了。
因此，荀彧向曹操提出了三大纲领：奉主上以从民望，秉至公以服雄杰，扶弘义以至英俊。什么意思呢？就是尊奉天子以顺从民意，大公元私以降服诸侯，弘扬正义以招揽英雄。荀彧说，尊奉天子以顺从民意这是最大的趋势，他称之为大顺；大公元私以降服诸侯这是最大的策略，他称之为大略；弘扬正义以招揽英雄这是最大的道德，他称之为大德。大顺至尊，大略至公，大德至义，有此三大，将军您一定是所向披靡、战无不胜，即便有人出来跟您作对那也只能是螳臂当车、小丑跳梁，成不了气候。
那么我们比较一下荀彧的这段话，和沮授的那段话，也是叫做高下立现。荀彧反反复复强调的是一个字：“义”；沮授对袁绍反反复复强调的是一个字：“利”。荀彧反反复复说，尊奉天子是最大的正义；沮授反反复复说，挟持天子是最大的利益。所以沮授反反复复强调利，只能说明袁绍重利；荀彧反反复复强调义，只能说明曹操重义，至少在公元196年，也就是汉献帝建安元年的时候，曹操这个人还是讲义的，或者是这个时候曹操还是装着讲义的。
荀彧和毛玠提出“奉天子以令不臣”这个口号，他们两个人的想法是要通过尊奉现任皇帝维护国家统一，反对国家分裂。这两个人的心思我们可以肯定，但不能说这就是曹操的心思，曹操这个时候的心思，我们只能说他是可能是赞成这个观点。但是这个说法它也给曹操戴了一个紧箍咒，就是曹操不敢太膨胀自己的个人野心，尤其是荀彧的话，他是用曹操自己的话来给曹操戴了一个帽子，戴高帽子的同时代了一个紧箍咒。所以到曹操晚年野心膨胀的时候，这两个人就没有好果子吃了，荀彧据说被曹操谋杀，毛玠下了大狱，这是后话。
现在我们还是回到汉献帝建安元年这个时候，这个时候的曹操我个人认为，他还刚刚完成一个转变，就是由一个热血沸腾的青年将领，转变为一个政治成熟的乱世英雄。我个人的观点是，这个时候的曹操还不是奸雄，是英雄，他还是主张国家统一、反对国家分裂的，为了这一点，他要维护现任皇帝，因为现任皇帝在当时的情况下是国家统一的象征。
［画话音］易中天先生认为，历史上真实的曹操在建安元年的时候，还是想维护现任皇帝的。但小说《三国演义》中写曹操迎奉天子后是要独揽大权，朝廷上的事情是先禀告曹操，再上报皇帝。《三国演义》中这一段内容和历史真实一样吗？历史上的曹操在这个时候有个人野心吗？
但是你要说曹操这个时候是一点个人野心都没有，这个恐怕也不实事求是。据一条不太可靠的史料是这样说的，当时有一个太史令，就是王朝的史官，叫做王立的，就老去跟汉献帝说，说天命是要更改的啊，我是历史学家啊，我懂历史，历史的规律就是什么呢？就是天命靡长，这个老天爷它不会总是喜欢某些人的，或者某个家族的，据我这个懂历史的人看呢，这个天命现在要由汉移到魏了，将来能够安天下的不是姓刘的是姓曹的了。老在说，结果曹操有一天就把他请到旁边，拉着他的手说，说我知道先生是一个忠臣，但是天道微妙，天机不可泄漏，还是少说一点吧。那么这条材料我认为是不太可靠的，因为在这个时候如果就有人说是魏要取代汉，我总觉得不太可靠，但是你说曹操这个时候一丁点这个心思都没有，恐怕也很难讲。总而言之，就是曹操把皇帝接到他的地盘里面，自己位居三公以后，随着他的实力的强大，随着他敌人逐渐地消亡，他的野心也是开始在膨胀。估计曹操后来变得越来越专横，越来越跋扈，越来越霸道，越来越不把皇帝当皇帝，于是终于发生了衣带诏案件。
这个事情的案发时间是建安五年的正月，挑头的人就是汉献帝的岳父董承。据说董承从汉献帝手上接过了一个腰带，腰带里有一封密诏，密诏要他去杀了曹操。这个事情后来被曹操发现了以后，把董承这一伙全部杀了，刘备逃之天天，刘备据说也是参加了密谋的。那么这个事情，《三国演义》是大做了文章的，因为《三国演义》它是要反曹操的，逮住这个事情肯定是大做文章的，但是正史上只有寥寥几行字，而且也有历史学家提出质疑。那么我觉得至少这个事情可以说明两个问题，说明什么呢？说明这个形同虚设的皇帝他还是管用的，当时这些人要做什么事情他都要打皇帝的旗号，在朝的像曹操这样的人他就逼着皇帝下达对自己有利的诏书，那些反对曹操的人只好宣称自己有皇帝的密诏，反正曹操手上拿的是公开的诏书，反对派手上拿的是秘密的诏书，每个人都说我得到了皇帝的授权，可见皇帝还是有用的。第二个说明了曹操这个时候野心开始膨胀，对皇帝的侍奉和尊崇已经开始变得言不由衷。
那么这个过程完全是曹操有计划、有预谋地在完成呢，还是自然而然形成的呢？这个实话说，也搞不清。如果确有衣带诏一事，说明汉献帝恐怕也到了忍无可忍的地步，因为这个皇帝从来没有过过舒坦日子，应该说是早就学会了忍气吞声，如果不是太不像话，他不至于冒此风险。那么这件事情往往是用来证明曹操挟天子以令诸侯的一个证据，既然这件事情我们不能够很清楚地把它坐实了，我们也不能够很清楚地坐实曹操这个时候究竟是奉天子还是挟天子。
其实在我看来，奉天子和挟天子在曹操这里不矛盾，而且曹操还得到了另外一个好处，就是他可以利用这面旗帜，或者说利用这张王牌来最大限度地广纳人才，他可以名正言顺地在全国招贤。而当时国内的人才基本上都愿意到许都去，因为毕竟到许都去说起来是在中央做事情，它至少第一个有面子，第二个比较名正言顺。结果是什么样呢？是官位是国家的，人才是自己的，曹操做了一笔大大合算的买卖。现在我们知道曹操把现任皇帝弄到他的地盘上以后，他就获得了政治资本和人力资源，他的本钱翻倍地增长。于是，他一支手高高地举起维护王室、保卫皇帝这一面在当时看来是正义的旗帜，另一只手从背后悄悄地拔出了刀子，而且出手极快，他要用这把刀荡平四海、一统九州，实现他九合诸侯、统一中国的理想。那么曹操他顺利吗？请看下集，鬼使神差。
曹操迎奉天子迁都许县以后，拥有了最大的政治资本和人力资源，于是，他一手举起奉天子的旗帜，一手拔出征讨天下的刀子，试图以次号令诸侯荡平四海，一同行动。这当然并不容易，也不可能十分顺利。在这个艰苦卓绝的斗争中，曹操好几次差一点就全军覆没，死于非命。那么是什么原因使得他能够化险为夷，转败为胜呢？又是谁鬼使神差般地来到他的身边，给了他关键性地帮助呢？厦门大学易中天教授将为我们精彩品三国之——鬼使神差。
* 易中天：
在前面的讲座里面，我们讲到汉献帝建安元年，也就是公元196年，对于曹操来说是非常关键的一年，这一年他做了两件大事，一个是奉天子，第二个是屯田。第一件事情使他获得了政治上的优势，第二件事情使他获得了经济上的丰收。他现在有了一个在当时看来正义的旗帜，另外又有了丰足的粮草，他可以来实现他的政治理想。那么他顺利吗？
事情一开始叫做出奇地顺利。汉献帝建安二年，也就是公元197年的正月，曹操南征张绣。因为在当时的情况下张绣算是实力比较弱的，吃柿子拣软的捏，先拿张绣开刀。结果怎么样？曹操的军队开到宛城的时候，张绣举手投降。这是一个意外的胜利啊，曹操刚刚奉天子以令不臣，或者说挟天子以令诸侯，就兵不血刃地拿下了宛城，征服了张绣，曹操就开始飘飘然了，就开始得意忘形了。他做了两件不该做的事情，第一件事情是强纳张绣的婶婶，也就是张绣的婶婶估计是很漂亮的。曹操这个人他是喜欢美女的，他每到一个地方他都要搂草打兔子，除了占领这个城池，或者政治上的胜利以外，顺手牵羊也弄几个女人回去。他一眼看去，张绣的婶婶这么漂亮，哈哈，笑纳，这让张绣觉得很没面子，很屈辱。另一件事情，他就是和张绣的贴身侍卫胡车儿套近乎，曹操除了喜欢美女以外他也喜欢人才是吧，一看胡车儿这是个人才，又送钱又送礼又请客又吃饭，这让张绣感到紧张，什么意思啊？是不是要谋杀我啊？于是张绣突然反叛，这个反叛是在曹操措手不及的时候发生的，结果打得曹操落花流水、丢盔卸甲。曹操的长子曹昂，这是曹操最中意的接班人，牺牲了，曹操最贴身的爱将典韦牺牲了，还搭上了一个侄子叫曹安民，曹操自己也差一点人头落地。
所以这个人得意，不要忘形，得意的时候还是把尾巴夹起来好。曹操这个人是夹不住的，他一得意他就忘形，果然吃了亏了。那么策划这一次反叛的人叫做贾诩，贾诩是甘肃武威人，字文和，文章的文，和平的和，很好的字，可是这个人干的活儿可以称之为“乱武”，他是专门捣乱的。
［画话音］贾诩做了什么事情，会得到“乱武”的评价呢？公元189年，汉灵帝驾崩，西北军阀董卓入京，废立皇帝，震动朝野，并且滥杀无辜，株连无数。于是，司徒王允联合吕布在朝廷上刺杀了董卓，董卓旧部李傕、郭汜见主帅身亡，心灰意冷，准备解散队伍逃跑，在路上遇见贾诩。贾诩为他们出谋划策，结果却给国家带来了灾祸。
当时董卓的旧部李傕和郭汜这两个人准备解散了部队就回老家去，抄小路回老家，算了，不干了。路上碰到贾诩，贾诩说二位将军到哪里去啊？他们说你看董大帅都死于非命了，咱还回西北去吧！嗨，贾诩说，就你们两个这样就想回西北去，你们的部队呢？解散了。你们这两个人部队都没有了是个什么将军啊？告你吧，路上一个亭长就能把你们捉拿归案，你们这是找死去了。这两个说，那你说怎么办呢？贾诩说很简单啊，收拾旧部，杀回长安，为董太师报仇！你杀回去成功了，奉国家以令天下，这个和奉天子以令不臣、挟天子以令诸侯都是如出一辙的，这个话。你杀回长安去成功了以后你把皇帝当个宝贝抓在手上，号令天下；不成功你再走也不迟啊，你干吗现在就跑回去啊！两个人想，是啊，我们干吗现在就解除武装，灰溜溜地回去，杀回去！两个杀回去了，一塌糊涂，这是贾诩干的好事。
那么这两个家伙回到长安以后祸乱国家，祸乱人民，屠杀大臣，贾诩自己都觉得这事儿是不是干错了。所以这两个家伙要给贾诩封个侯，贾诩说什么救命之恩，这个是小事情了，我不要当侯。说那你就当个上书仆射吧，当个大官，贾诩说你看我这个人又没有什么名声，又没有什么面子，让我当这么大个官我怎么当得下来呢，不当不当不当。他不当，他不接受这个酬谢。就弄得这个李傕和郭汜这两个人对他是又信任、又尊敬、又崇拜、又害怕，那么这个时候贾诩倒利用这个关系做了些好事，比方这两个豺狼要杀谁的时候，贾诩就拦一拦，也做了点好事。
等到汉献帝被接回洛阳的时候，贾诩想，这个地方我就不能再待了，我不能再在朝廷待下去了，走吧！他就辞去了官职，出来了。出来了七转八转地最后就到了张绣这儿，张绣对他奉若上宾，言听计从。那么张绣想反叛曹操的时候，贾诩就跟他设计了，就说你去跟曹操说，说我们的部队要移防，就是部队我要调动一下，防区要变一下，问曹操可不可以？曹操说可以啊，曹操那个时候得意洋洋么。然后又跟曹操说，说我们这个军队的运输车比较小，很多东西装不下，能不能允许我们的战士把盔甲和武器都随身携带，我们盔甲就穿在身上了，武器就拿在手上，以免我搬运起来比较困难，行不行？曹操这个时候风花雪月啊，可以可以可以。于是这个张绣的部队就穿着军装，扛着武器，开着战车，堂而皇之地从曹操的军营前走过，突然调过头来，冲进曹营。那当然是杀了曹操一个措手不及，贾诩干的事情。
那么这一次对于曹操来说那是一个惨败了，但是曹操没有把责任推到别人身上，这是曹操了不起的地方，他甚至没有追究主张接受张绣投降的那些人。换了别人，比方说袁绍或者袁术，他肯定要追究：当时是张绣要假投降——他肯定现在要说张绣是假投降，——张绣当时假投降是谁主张赞成的？曹操没有，自己做检讨。他把部队召集起来跟将领们说：这次是我错了，而且我知道我错在哪里了，我接受张绣投降的时候我应该扣他一个儿子在我军营里作人质，我没做这件事，我错了，我下回不会再错了。这个应该说是曹操了不起的地方。
［画话音］曹操为什么会在南征张绣的战争中失利？根据易中天先生的分析，曹操是得意忘形，做了两件不该做的事情，结果导致了投降的张绣突然反叛，打了他一个措手不及。这是曹操不够成熟的表现，但是，曹操没有推卸责任，而是主动做检讨，承认了错误。那么，在接下来和张绣的几次较量中，曹操变得成熟了吗？
但是一个人要成熟也没那么快，曹操也一样。所以到了第二次，也就是汉献帝建安二年的十一月，曹操再次南征张绣的时候，就把张绣打了个落花流水。曹操这一次虽然是吸取了上次的教训，不骄傲了，不翘尾巴了，取得了胜利了，不等于他下次还要胜利。那么到了第三次，汉献帝建安三年的时候，四月份，曹操三征张绣，这一次又差点栽个大跟头。当时曹操的军师叫做荀攸，我讲过了，荀攸是曹操前期五大谋士之一，他当时的官职叫做军师祭酒，军师祭酒这个官职是曹操发明的，相当于现在的参谋，随军作战参谋。荀攸就建议曹操不要打张绣，他说张绣上次被您打到穰城以后，他就和刘表结成了联盟，由刘表提供粮草，而刘表这个人他是不会当真给张绣提供粮草的，所以张绣和刘表两个人总有一天他们自己要打起来，我们不如等一等。你现在把他们逼急了，他们两个就结成死党，联合起来打我们，对我们不利。曹操不听，结果怎么样呢？结果果然刘表和张绣结成死党，联合起来打曹操。
这个时候曹操就下令撤军，曹操一下令撤军张绣就高兴了，马上下令追击，贾诩拦住，将军万万不可追，你追，必败。张绣说，不会啦，这曹操已经逃跑啦，我们不乘胜追击啊？他说追！结果怎么样呢？结果被曹操打得大败，丢盔卸甲，灰溜溜地回来了。刚刚坐下，一口水还没喝呢，贾诩说，将军，赶快再追！张绣说，先生这话我就听不懂了，上次张绣要去追先生说不能追，现在张绣都打败回来了先生说赶快追，什么意思啊？贾诩说你不要问什么意思了，你现在追就是。张绣想这个，这个没道理啊，但是一想这个贾诩真是料事如神，那就追吧！好，了不起我再败一回。又收拾他的残兵败将，又追过去，大胜而归。这回来以后张绣就对贾诩佩服得五体投地了，先生，第一回张绣是以精兵追退兵，先生说必败；第二回张绣以败兵追胜兵，先生又说必胜，张绣左思右想它怎么都想不明白，先生能不能指点一下？。嗨，贾诩说，这个事情其实非常地简单，将军你想一想，曹操和我们作战，他有失利吗？没有；他有失误吗？没有；他有失策吗？没有，那他为什么要撤退？一定是他后面出事了，一定是他后院失火，朝中出事，所以他是撤退，不是溃退，他是有计划地撤军，因此以曹公之英明必亲自断后。将军您虽然是英勇善战，实话实说，论打仗，比曹公那还差一点，所以将军这样追上去以后遇到亲自断后的是曹公，你必败；而曹操之所以赶回去是他朝中出事了，所以他一定要匆忙赶路，他既然发现你已经被打败了，他一定不再亲自断后，他一定率领前军往前面走了，断后的一定是打不过将军你的，所以你必胜。哎呀，张绣说，贾先生你真是料事如神啊！实际上我们看《三国演义》总说诸葛亮料事如神，会打仗，那比贾诩老实说是不如的。
［画话音］神机妙算的贾诩在小说《三国演义》中所占的篇幅并不多，远远比不上同样神机妙算的诸葛亮。但通过易中天先生的分析我们知道，在真实的三国历史上，贾诩是一个非常聪明的人。那么，贾诩预料曹操撤退是事出有因，他的预料正确吗？
正确。曹操之所以撤军，是他得到了一份紧急情报，说袁绍的谋士田丰向袁绍建议，趁着曹操打张绣的时候赶快突袭许都，把那皇帝给我抢回来。这个皇帝比张绣重要多了，所以曹操赶快撤军。
所以这一仗应该说是曹操和张绣打了个平手，但是曹操这回没有骄傲，他又向他的军事祭酒荀攸做检讨，说不听先生之言以至于此。而袁绍呢，袁绍没有接受田丰的建议，他没有去偷袭许都，所以对于曹操来说这是一场虚惊。尽管如此，曹操还是总结经验，奖励那些给自己提意见的人，感谢那些劝阻他不要打这一仗的人。这就是曹操后来能够成功的一个重要的原因：就是每打一仗，打败了检讨自己，打胜了感谢别人。后来曹操去征乌桓的时候，也是打胜了仗的，但是是险胜，当时他从乌桓撤军的时候天寒地冻，军中没有一粒粮食、一滴水，所以胜得非常艰险，打胜了仗回到朝中曹操下了个命令，给我查一查当时谁反对我打乌桓？全部要查出来。命令一下以后人人自危，因为这一仗是打胜了的；谁知道曹操一个一个地重奖，谢谢你们提醒，这一仗侥幸胜利，而诸位反对我打这一仗的(是)长远之计，我曹操不该存侥幸之心，你们的意见是对的，虽然我打胜了。后来曹操又发布褒奖令，说我曹操南征北战，取得了这么多胜利，难道都是我的功劳吗？是诸位的功劳。有了成绩归功于别人，有了错误责备自己，尽管检讨得不到位，这在那个时代就是了不起的肚量。而且正因为曹操的这种大度和这种胸襟，他才吸引了那么多的人才，他才取得那么多的胜利，而且以至于在建安四年十一月那个投降了他、又背叛了他、又和他打了三仗的张绣主动来投降了，真的投降了，张绣这一次投降又是贾诩的主意。
［画话音］在前面的讲述中我们知道，张绣有过投降曹操后又背叛的经历，还在乱军中杀死了曹操的儿子曹昂、侄子草安民，还有曹操的爱将典韦。按照常理推测，曹操这个时候应该对张绣恨之入骨，贾诩为什么还敢出主意让张绣投降曹操，张绣为什么真的听从了贾诩的建议，事情的经过究竟是怎样的呢？
当时是曹操和袁绍这两大集团在逐鹿中原，因此曹操集团和袁绍集团都要争取中间力量，争取第三种力量，因此他们也都在争取张绣。这一回袁绍的人倒是来得早，袁绍派了一个使节来见张绣，说你赶快投到我们这边来吧，这个政治斗争你可别站错了队啊，站错队是没有好下场的，我们袁大人如何如何。张绣还没有回话，贾诩马上站起来说，哼哼，麻烦使节大人回去告诉你们袁将军，就说我们主公说了，袁本初连自己的兄弟都不能容忍，还能容忍我们吗？就把袁绍的这个使节打发回去了。张绣一听，脸都吓白了，说先生啊，你这么一点面子不讲就把袁绍的人打发走了，我们怎么办呢？贾诩说这个事情很好办啊，张绣说怎么办啊？贾诩说，投靠曹操啊！哎呀，张绣说，亏你想得出，你又不是不知道不是上回按你的计策我们都反叛过一次曹操了，我们去投降曹操？合着曹操现在又这么弱，我们去投他干什么？
贾诩说告诉你，这正是我们要投降曹操的原因。第一，曹操现在奉天子以令不臣，在政治上有优势，投靠曹操对我们来说有理。第二，曹操现在势力比袁绍要弱，我们这么一点人马送到袁绍那里，那叫做年三十儿的凉菜——有我们过年，没我们他也过年；而曹操现在跟袁绍作对，他实力又不够，我们送上门去，那叫雪中送炭啊！这叫做有利。第三，据我看来曹操这个人胸怀大志，他要成就的是王霸之业，像这样的人不会计较个人恩怨，他一定是把大局放在个人恩怨之上，他一定需要我们这样一个反叛过他的人去投靠他，这叫做有安全。将军你放心地去投降吧！
张绣想来想去，反正也没有什么别的出路了，那就投降曹操吧！果然，一听说张绣来投降，曹操是极其热情地去迎接他，拉住张绣的手问长问短，问寒问暖，亲热得不能再亲热，只字不提宛城反叛之事，当下摆下酒宴，盛情款待，而且立即约为婚姻，我们做个儿女亲家吧！给予极高地信任和款待。从此张绣成为曹操帐下一员战将，贾诩成为曹操幕中一位谋臣，而且曹操终其一生给予张绣的奖赏从来就是超过其他人的。张绣最后是封到了两千户，而曹操其他的那些人再封侯不超过一千户，完全在贾诩的预料之中。
［画话音］小说《三国演义》中，张绣和贾诩都不是主要人物，他们在三国故事里只是次要角色。但在真实的历史中，贾诩劝张绣投降曹操，却是在关键的时刻给了曹操关键性的帮助。那么，张绣和贾诩投降曹操后，他们最终的命运究竟是怎样的呢？
当然了，张绣这个人最后可能还是遭了报复，可能遭了报复，时间是在八年之后，八年之后曹操征乌桓的时候，张绣莫名其妙地死了。有材料说是张绣投降曹操以后其实心里头还是忐忑不安的，尤其是见了曹丕，因为曹丕的哥哥曹昂是在他反叛的时候牺牲的，所以他总想讨好一下曹丕，就请曹丕吃饭，曹丕突然翻脸，说你杀了我哥哥你还有脸请我吃饭，张绣自杀，这是一个不一定可靠的材料。那么，张绣的儿子张泉倒确确实实是被曹丕杀了的，时间在二十年以后，这个时候张绣的儿子张泉卷入了一个谋反案，叫魏讽谋反案，这个案子现在也说不清楚了，这个案子株连的人非常之多，张泉是其中的之一。那么张泉是不是参加了这个谋反，有各种可能，可能是张泉因为父亲被曹丕逼死了以后走投无路，他参加了谋反；第二个就是曹丕因为逼死了张泉的父亲，自己心里过不去，就干脆诬陷张泉谋反；那么第三种可能就是曹丕他也没有杀张绣，也没有逼死张绣，但是他知道对于他父亲来说，杀子之仇是不能不报的，这个仇既然不能在张绣身上报，就在张泉身上报。你张绣不是杀了曹操一个儿子吗？那我们现在也杀你张绣一个儿子，那不抵了吗！这都是猜测性意见。
但是曹操和贾诩的关系那是始终都很好。曹操对于张绣的态度是这样的，是既拉拢又防范，但装着不防范，做出一副不防范的样子；那么对于贾诩呢，是又感激又欣赏，感激他雪中送炭，欣赏他谋略过人。所以在欢迎张绣来投降的时候，曹操私下里拉着贾诩说，太感谢你了，使我信重于天下的就是先生。所以，曹操是诚心诚意地感谢贾诩，而贾诩也是算准了曹操会诚心诚意地感谢他的。因为在我看来，贾诩这个我们观众朋友可能不太熟悉的人物，有可能是三国历史上最聪明的人，他聪明在什么地方呢？洞悉人性，洞察人心，他总是能把他要打交道的人的心思摸得清清楚楚。
贾诩离开长安以后，先投靠了一个叫段煨的人，段煨对他客客气气，但是贾诩终于还是决定要去投靠张绣。当时就有朋友问贾诩了，说我们觉得段将军对先生非常好啊，先生为什么还要走呢？贾诩说，你们是知其一不知其二，你们只看到段将军对我客气，你们没看到段将军他为什么对我客气，他是怕我，他知道我贾某人的声望和谋略都在他之上，所以他迟早要对我下手，我必须离开这个地方。他越是对我客气，就越是证明他对我有戒备，我离开他他一定喜出望外。而他这个人是没有什么外援的，是很孤独的，或者说孤立的，他看见我到张绣那去以后，他希望我到张绣那去能帮他的忙，所以我走了以后他对我的家人一定会非常之好。而张绣那里呢，那是没有谋士的，所以我如果投奔张绣，张绣也一定对我是言听计从，这样一来我安全了，我家里人也安全了。果然，贾诩到了张绣那儿张绣是奉为上宾，执子孙礼，就是把贾诩当长辈来伺候；而段煨呢，对贾诩留在他那儿的家人好得不得了。你说说，贾诩这一辈子是不是神机妙算？
他为什么神机妙算？就因为他看透了人性和人心，贾诩就是这样一个非常知人的人，因此他同时也是一个非常知己的人，一个很有自知之明的人。他非常清楚像他这样从敌人的阵营里投降过来，又谋略过人的人，对于曹操意味着什么，那既是利用对象，也一定同时是防范对象。所以贾诩投降曹操以后，为人处事变得非常低调，轻易不出谋划策，也不结交朋友，经常是闭门谢客，安安静静待在自个儿家里面，不招惹是非，甚至他的儿子、女儿要跟人家结婚，他也不找高门大户。结果贾诩的结局在三国时代的谋士中应该说是最好的，一直活到77岁，寿终正寝，平安无事。所以贾诩这个人，真是个聪明人。贾诩做的这件事儿，也真是个聪明事儿。
贾诩让张绣投降曹操是在建安四年十一月，就在这一年的春天，袁绍集结了十万精锐部队，向许都方向开进，意在发动一场翦灭曹操的战争。而曹操的部队也已经开到了官渡，一场决定当时中国命运前途的战争即将打响，这就是有名的官渡之战，这是一场怎样的战争呢？请看下集，一决雌雄。
从公元190年到公元200年，经过近十年的诸侯混战，形成了势力最强的两大集团，这就是曹操集团和袁绍集团。袁绍获得了翼州、青州、并州、幽州四州的土地，雄居北方；曹操的势力西达关中，东到兖州、豫州、徐州，控制了黄河以南、淮汉以北的大部分地区，与袁绍形成了沿黄河下游南北对峙的局面。此时，杨奉已灭，吕布已亡，袁术已死，张绣已降，孙策据守江东，刘表中立观望，局势变得十分明朗，那就是袁绍和曹操两雄不并立，必须一决雌雄。
当时，袁绍的实力远远胜过曹操，自然不甘屈居于曹操之下，于是袁绍决定进攻曹操，这就发生了历史上有名的“官渡之战”。那么，兵力微弱的曹操是如何应对势力强大的袁绍的呢？厦门大学易中天教授做客《百家讲坛》，为您精彩讲述那段波澜壮阔的历史，《易中天品三国》之“一决雌雄”正在播出，敬请关注！
* 易中天：
我们今天讲官渡之战，战争是在建安五年二月正式打响的，一共分为四个阶段。
官渡之战的第一个阶段：交锋阶段
第一个阶段是“交锋阶段”，袁绍先发制人，建安五年二月，袁绍驻军黎阳，在黄河的北岸，派大将颜良攻打隔河的白马，同时派大将文丑进攻延津，主战场是在白马。这个时候驻守白马的是刘延，刘延有三千人，这样打到建安五年四月的时候刘延顶不住了，给曹操写了一封鸡毛信求援，曹操也知道刘延顶不住，决定增援白马。这个时候曹操的一个谋士叫做荀攸的就跟曹操说，咱不打白马，我们打延津，曹操马上就明白过来了，什么意思呢？声东击西，现在我不是白马吃紧吗？我们不打白马，我们军队从延津出发渡过黄河，做出一副要包抄袁绍后路的这样一个架势，袁绍一定会上当受骗，增援延津。曹操马上采纳了荀攸的这个建议，率领一支部队大张旗鼓地向延津方向挺进。请注意，他这个进军是大张旗鼓，故意让袁绍的侦察兵知道，于是袁绍的侦察兵马上回去报告，果然袁绍上当受骗，派出人马增援延津。但是曹操走到半路的时候，曹操下令部队原地休息，然后派一支轻骑兵抄小路直扑白马，为首的将军（之一）就是关羽。
［画话音］在这里还有一段插曲。公元199年末，当曹操正部署和袁绍作战时，刘备起兵反抗曹操，并积极与袁绍联系，打算合力夹攻曹操。曹操亲自率领精兵攻打刘备，一举占领了沛县，收复了徐州，刘备全军覆败，带领少数兵马逃往河北投奔到了袁绍的帐下。关羽无力抵抗，投降了曹操。
关羽投降曹操以后，曹操对他非常好，关羽当时就做了一个决定：为曹操立下汗马功劳以后再回去找他哥哥刘备。那么关羽还有其他将领带着这支轻骑兵扑到白马，颜良措手不及，被关羽力斩马下。这个时候，袁绍才发现是上当了，中了声东击西，调虎离山之计，然后派刘备和文丑转过来拦截曹操。而曹操也很清楚，白马这个地方虽然解围了，但是这个地方不能再守，袁绍一定会反扑过来，而且我们白马一定守不住。而且袁绍一旦得到了白马以后，他一定要拿白马的老百姓出气，要屠城，因此曹操决定带着白马的老百姓沿着黄河往延津走。我们读《三国演义》的人都知道，刘备打败仗以后走的时候要带上老百姓的，恐怕很少有人知道曹操撤退的时候也是带老百姓的。曹操带着这么多白马的老百姓往延津走，当然是走得很慢了，结果呢，撞上了刘备和文丑的军队。
当时情况是怎么样呢？是曹操有五六百个骑兵，来到了延津东南面的一个山坡上，正准备休息。哨兵向曹操报告，说报告，前面来了几百个骑兵，曹操说知道了。过一会儿哨兵又报告，说来了一千个骑兵，步兵数都数不清。曹操说别报了，然后下命令，下马，原地休息。将领就不懂了，说敌人都扑过来了，我们应该上马准备啊，我们怎么下马原地休息呢？再说我们从白马运过来那些辎重，就是粮食、布匹，七七八八的东西都在路上呢，我们起码要把这些东西都运回军营去，准备迎战吧。曹操说不要管，曹操说你不要管，都给我下马，坐在地上休息。这又是曹操的一计，什么计呢？诱敌之计，果然刘备和文丑带着骑兵冲过来以后看到一地的东西，都是好东西啊，所以骑兵就开始犹豫，犹豫了一阵以后都抵挡不住诱惑，全部都下马来去捡那些东西，抢那些宝贝，这个时候曹操一声令下，上马！冲锋号吹起来，战鼓擂起来，杀声喊起来，六百铁骑从高坡上倾斜而下，顿时打得袁军满地找牙，文丑也被立斩马下。谁杀的？不知道，《三国演义》说是关羽，正史无记载，估计可能也是关羽，因为就是这次战争以后，关羽就留下了一封书信，一封感谢信，封存了曹操给他所有的赏赐，骑上他的赤兔马去寻找那个比兔子跑得还快的哥哥去了。而且文丑被杀了以后刘备是掉头就跑，刘备这人这个本事还是比较大的。这就是官渡战争的第一个阶段。
［画话音］在官渡之战的交锋阶段，曹操声东击西，攻其不备，打了袁绍一个措手不及，不仅解了白马之围，还折了袁绍两员大将，曹军可以说是初战告捷。然而袁绍虽然初战失利，但却在兵力上仍然占有优势，曹军想彻底取胜还需时日，那么接下来的双方较量又会出现什么情况呢？
官渡之战的第二个阶段：相持阶段
这个战争打完了以后，曹操心里很明白，自己其实不是袁绍的对手，因为袁绍当时号称是十万精锐部队，曹操呢，按照《三国志》的说法，不足一万。当然，给《三国志》做注的裴松之认为这个数字是不准确的，曹操的军队怎么算也不只一万人，估计也就是两三万，肯定是以少胜多，以寡敌众啦。所以曹操明白，延津、白马不可守，于是曹操虽然打胜了仗，退军官渡。而袁绍呢，他觉得他牛啊，曹操打胜了仗还往回跑肯定是胆怯，是打不赢嘛，我们就应该前进，于是袁绍就进军官渡。但是袁绍不知道曹操这个决策是很务实的，曹操知道这个时候我如果在白马和延津和袁绍对抗的话我是不合算的，我宁肯往后退一步，退一步有什么好处呢？拉长了敌方的补给线。我们看一下地图就知道，许都在这儿，官渡在这儿，邺城在这儿，黎阳在这儿，白马在这儿，在白马打仗曹操的补给线长，在官渡进行战争袁绍的补给线长，所以曹操叫做敌进我退。但是退到官渡呢，曹操也无路可退了，于是袁绍就在官渡这个地方扎起了营垒，曹操也相应地扎起了营垒，战争进入第二个阶段：“相持阶段”。
这个阶段的战争技术含量很高，袁绍先是在自己的营垒里边垒高丘，他把土弄来做成一个小山，上面再盖楼，然后派他的弓箭手居高临下地对着曹营射箭。这个厉害，好像现在的火箭炮似的，曹操（的军队）死伤很重。那么曹操想怎么对付他，于是他制造了一个机器，叫做发石机，这个机器什么样子我现在也描绘不出来，反正它能够把这么大一颗石头像炮一样地打过去，发明了这么一个机器，做了一批这个机器，然后把大石头一个石头一个石头地往袁营里面发射。这样相持了几个月，双方是不分胜负，但是都很疲劳
有一天从许都运军粮的车子开进了曹操的军营，曹操去劳军。曹操这个人对士兵还是很好的，他看见运粮的那些运输队非常辛苦，面黄肌瘦，有些运夫穿不起鞋，是光着脚赶路的，满脚都是老茧，甚至磨破，流血。曹操看了以后非常难过，曹操就走过去和他们问长问短，问寒问暖，然后拉着他们的手说：弟兄们辛苦了，请大家再给我十五天的时间，只要十五天，十五天以后我再也不让你们这么辛苦了。也就是说，十五日之内要结束战争。曹操他有这个把握吗？没有，实际想法是曹操不想打了，他准备在十五日之内撤军，不打了，太累了，受不了了，他写了一封信给留守在许都的荀彧，但是荀彧反对。荀彧说，明公啊，这一仗咱们打也得打，不想打、不能打也得打，请明公想一想，袁绍这一回是倾巢而出，十万精兵全部拿出来了，就是要和我们决一死战，他是不会善罢甘休的，你退他还要进，你没有退路了，只能顶住。那么曹操又去征求贾诩的意见，贾诩说，曹公啊，你有四个方面比袁绍强：你的智慧超过袁绍，勇敢超过袁绍，用人超过袁绍，决断超过袁绍，你有四个方面超过袁绍，为什么打了半年还不能胜利呢？根本原因是你总想万无一失，你顾虑太多了，只要你下定决心，集中兵力，一定能够胜利。
贾诩和荀彧的意见是对的，战争是一种风险极大的事情，尤其是在冷兵器时代，谁都没有必胜的把握，在战争中做到万无一失是很困难的，这就需要主帅的意志，在这种情况下，战争的胜负往往决定于主帅的意志是否坚强，而最后的胜利也往往存在于再坚持一下的努力之中。
［画话音］在官渡之战的第二个阶段，曹袁双方相持不下，各有损耗。曹军粮草将尽，士卒疲乏，曹操几乎失去了坚守的信心，他开始顶不住了，心生撤军的想法。那么，此时已经军心动摇的曹操会撤军吗？还会有什么机遇等待着曹操呢？
官渡之战的第三个阶段：转折阶段
机遇说来就来，由于三件事情的发生，战争进入了第三个阶段：“转折阶段”。
第一件事情，刘备开溜。官渡之战相持阶段的时候，袁绍曾经派刘备南下，到许都附近去骚扰。联合了一个背判曹操的原来黄巾军的一个人，叫刘辟，他们两个人在许都周围骚扰曹操，最后被曹军打得落花流水。刘备回到官渡以后，就跟袁绍说，这样打下去不行啊，我们是不是应该联合一下南方的刘表，我们联合刘表让刘表在南方攻打曹操一下不就行了吗。袁绍一想有道理啊，那你去吧，你和刘表不都是刘家的人嘛，当然是刘备去做这个使节，就批准刘备带着自己的军队去联合刘表。
刘备联合什么刘表啊，他就是开溜嘛！刘备为什么要开溜呢？一种可能是他打了败仗回来以后袁绍给他的脸色不好看，这是一部分历史学家的猜测，但这种可能性不是很大，或者是有也不是很重要。为什么呢？第一个，袁绍父子对刘备还是蛮客气的，根据史书上的记载，非常敬重；第二，就算这一回袁绍脸上不好看，刘备他也是能够忍受的，因为刘备这个人他一向都是在投靠这个、投靠那个，他曾经投靠公孙瓒打袁绍，后来又投靠掏谦打曹操，后来又投靠曹操打吕布，现在又投靠袁绍打曹操，他都换了多少回了，这个脸色难看一点他能忍住。我觉得他恐怕就是海轮上的耗子，最先知道这个船会不会翻，他政治上很敏感，他可能已经预料到袁绍要失败了，所以他溜之乎也。这个事当时没有引起足够的注意，但是我觉得这是一个征兆，这是第一件事情。
第二件事情，许攸叛逃。许攸叛逃的原因有三个说法，第一个说法是许攸贪财，袁绍不能满足他，所以他投奔曹操；第二个说法是许攸的家人为非作歹，被留守在邺城的审配下了大狱，所以许攸叛逃；第三种说法是许攸向袁绍建议，我们现在应该抄小路到许都去把天子劫持了，袁绍不采纳他的建议，所以叛逃。其实这三种说法是可以统一起来的，那就是许攸发现他在袁绍这里计谋也不能得到使用、他的欲望也不能得到满足，那么他觉得不能待下去，他投奔曹操。而许攸这个人是很重要的，他是袁绍最早的谋士，掌握了大量的军事机密，而且他这个人是非常聪明的、有很多主意的人。他一投奔曹操，曹操拍手大笑，吾事济矣，哈哈，这下我这个事好弄了。许攸一投奔曹操，马上就跟曹操出了一个主意：火烧乌巢。这个乌巢在哪里呢？乌巢在这里，乌巢这个地方是袁绍的囤积军粮的地方，是个粮库。许攸给曹操出主意，派骑兵突袭乌巢，一把火把袁绍的军粮烧它个干净，曹操马上采纳这个计策，连夜赶往乌巢。
那么在这个时候，就发生了第三件事情，张郃反水。张郃也是袁绍手下的一员大将，比颜良、文丑其实还好，颜良、文丑是有勇无谋，张郃是有勇有谋。当时袁绍这面得到曹操奇袭乌巢的消息以后，张郃就向袁绍提出来，必须立即增援乌巢，如果我们把乌巢丢了，我们连退路都没有了，我们肯定是一败涂地。但是袁绍手下有个谋士叫做郭图的不赞成，郭图说我们现在应该去打官渡，我们一打官渡，那曹操走到一半儿他就会回来救官渡，乌巢之围不解自救。袁绍觉得郭图这个办法好，就采纳郭图的办法，派一支很不怎么样的军队，派轻兵去救援乌巢，派重兵去攻打官渡。张郃说，主公这样不行，官渡这个地方是曹操的大本营，我们哪里是一会儿工夫能够拿下来的，要能够拿下来我早拿下来了，我们打了这么久就因为它拿不下来嘛，救乌巢吧！袁绍说不不不，就这样，打官渡。结果怎么样呢？乌巢失守，军粮全部烧光，而官渡打不下来。这个结果就证明郭图的这个主意出错了，对不对，郭图就很紧张，紧张以后他干什么事？他跑到袁绍那儿去打小报告，说主公，张郃听说我们丢了乌巢他幸灾乐祸呀，他说证明他正确。郭图拿准了袁绍这个家伙死要面子，袁绍马上起了疑心。张郃一看这下子完了，前方失利，后院失火，走投无路，和他部下高览一合计，算了，咱投降吧，把战车一烧，举起旗子来投降曹操。
这个时候张郃是在官渡，曹操在乌巢还没有回来，正在从乌巢回来的路上，守官渡的是曹操的军师荀攸和曹操的大将曹洪。当时张郃和高览带着部队来投降，曹洪说这是真降还是诈降？荀攸说不要犹豫了曹将军，赶快开门，肯定是真投降，打开营门，张郃进来。张郃投降以后曹操从乌巢也回来了，大喜过望，拉住张郃的手，这是韩信降了刘邦啊！
官渡之战的第四个阶段：决胜阶段
好了，刘备开溜，袁绍失了外援；许攸叛逃，袁绍丢了智囊；张郃反水，袁绍折了臂膀。三件事情都证明袁绍大势已去，战争迅速进入第四阶段：“决胜阶段”。这个阶段就简单了，就是曹操按照贾诩的建议，集中兵力进行反攻，而袁绍这边已经军心大乱了，不堪一击，袁绍本人带着他的长子袁谭跳上马掉头就往北跑，什么都顾不上了。稀里哗啦的，这场战争就结束了。
曹操来到袁绍的大帐里面，发现袁绍的大帐里面放着图书、珍宝、古玩，你说你出去行军打仗你带这些东西干什么？干什么，摆谱。袁绍总认为自己名士风流，儒将风度，走到哪儿都把书啊、什么珍宝古玩都带着，弄个架子架着，擦得干干净净的，这个风度好极了，结果呢，全部变成了曹操的战利品。这件事情是在建安五年的十月，这一仗以后，袁绍集团一蹶不振。
［画话音］官渡之战，以曹操的全面胜利而宣告结束，曹操以少胜多，出奇制胜地击败了袁绍的十万大军。这一战，使曹操最终在黄河中下游流域、当时中国最繁荣、文化最发达的地区奠定了他无可争辩的统治地位。而失败了的袁绍最终的下场和命运又将怎样呢？
建安七年五月，袁绍发病呕血而死。建安九年，袁绍的接班人袁尚被曹操击败。建安十年，袁绍的长子袁谭被曹操所杀。建安十二年九月，辽东太守公孙康谋杀了袁绍的接班人袁尚和袁绍的二儿子袁熙，把这两个人的人头送到了曹操的帐下，从此袁氏集团灭亡。袁尚和袁熙之死还有两个小插曲。
当时这俩小子跑到了公孙康的那个地方，辽东太守公孙康那个地方。大家都说要打一（仗），曹操说用不着，等着吧，公孙康会把这两个人的人头给我送来的。大家说为什么呢？曹操说很简单，他说这两伙人根本就是同床异梦，而且双方都会打对方的主意，我们要是逼急了，他们就会紧密地勾结起来；我们放他一马，他们自己就打起来。果然，袁尚和袁熙跑到公孙康那儿去了以后，兄弟俩一琢磨说，我们哪次请公孙康喝酒，我们把他做了，这地盘不就是咱俩的了么。公孙康想什么呢，说这两个家伙得罪了曹操，跑到我这儿来，我怎么跟曹操交待？我请他们喝酒，也把他们做了。结果被做了的是袁尚和袁熙，也真的是在酒宴上，公孙康设了一个鸿门宴，把这俩小子抓起来捆起来，扔地上。这两个人说，哎呀这地上冷啊，十一月嘛，冬天，这地上冰凉的，能不能给个垫子给我们坐一坐？公孙康说，哎呀，你们两个的人头都要出远门了，要什么坐垫啊！
所有这一切，都在曹操的预料之中，所以我反复强调一个观点，在政治斗争和军事斗争中，取得胜利的人是洞悉人性的人，是能够琢磨对方心思的人。袁谭死了，袁熙死了，袁尚死了，袁氏家族从此退出历史舞台了，所有这些都根源于官渡之战。官渡之战以后，当时中国的局势就发生了根本性的转变，北部中国基本上是姓曹的了。
这个结局在袁绍那边有两个人早就预见到了，一个是他的谋士沮授，还有一个是他的谋士田丰，这两个人坚决反对袁绍发动这样一场战争。而田丰反对得更激烈一些，田丰说，我们现在首先要做的事情是壮大自己，我们壮大自己的同时我们可以派小股部队去骚扰曹操，我们的部队分成好几股，从不同的方向出发，曹操救援东边我们就打西边，曹操救援西边那我们就打东边，反正让他疲于奔命，我们以逸待劳，这样用不了三年，这个事情就水到渠成了。现在主公您集结十万精锐部队孤注一掷，万一打败了怎么办？袁绍说哪里有万一啊？什么万一啊？我怎么会打败啊？田丰说，主公，不能这样啊！田丰也是袁绍的老谋士了，也可能是有点倚老卖老，拼命地拦住不让袁绍发动这场战争。袁绍勃然大怒，你干什么你？我现在部队已经集结，军号已经吹响，我就要出征了，你老在这儿说失败了怎么办、失败了怎么办、失败了怎么办，乌鸦嘴呀，再说，再说我杀了你，关起来，关到监狱里去，扰乱军心，动摇军心，诅咒我出师不利，你先在监狱里给我待着，等我凯旋回来的时候看你有什么脸面来见我！
一年多以后，官渡之战失败的消息传到了邺城，事实证明田丰是正确的，于是朋友们到狱中来看望田丰，并向他表示祝贺，说田兄啊，这下你就可以出狱啦，这下你就会得到重用了，因为事实证明你是正确的呀。田丰听了这个消息以后，仰天长叹，唉，这一回我是死定了！大家说这为什么，这怎么可能啊？不是证明你的正确的吗？是啊，为什么，怎么可能啊，请看下集，胜败有凭。
上一集讲到，刘备思贤若渴，真诚地来请诸葛亮，于是三顾茅庐成为一段千古佳话，而他们在草庐中的对话，就是大家所熟悉的《隆中对》。从古至今，学者们大多对《隆中对》中的精辟见解表示非常推崇。可有人说，“隆中对”就是诸葛亮写给刘备的一封求职书，未免有纸上谈兵的嫌疑。那么诸葛亮究竟想在“隆中对”中表达什么呢?“隆中对”打动刘备的究竟是哪一点呢？厦门大学易中天教授做客《百家讲坛》，为您精彩分析隆中对策的奥妙之处，《易中天品三国》之“隆中对策”正在播出，敬请关注。
 

  易中天：

  这一集我们讲《隆中对》，什么是“隆中对”呢？所谓“隆中对”实际上是刘备和诸葛亮在隆中的一次密谈，《三国志》说得很清楚：“因屏人曰”，也就是把其他的闲杂人等，甚至我估计连关羽、张飞都离开了那个密室，只有刘备和诸葛亮两个人谈，刘备就提了一个问题，刘备说：

  “汉室倾颓，奸臣窃命，主上蒙尘。孤不度德量力，欲信大义于天大，而智术短浅，遂用猖獗，至于今日。然志犹未已，君谓计将安出？”

  这是刘备的提问，这段话历来不太被人注意，认为这不过是一番套话，一个帽子，就像我们现在写文章一样，穿鞋戴帽，要有一个起头。其实这段话是有意义的，就说开头这十二个字：“汉室倾颓，奸臣窃命，主上蒙尘。”就是现在我们汉王朝这个政权已经很危险了，曹操这个奸臣掌握了国家的政权，而我们的皇上实际上是在落难。这段话刘备是必须说的，这是他的身份决定的，因为他是所谓“帝室之胄”，就是他是以刘家的宗室、后代这个身份来参加这一轮角逐的，他必须表明自己的政治立场，表明自己心系王室、心忧天下的这样一个政治立场，保证他政治上正确，这样他提出需要诸葛亮来帮助他的要求才能够得到理解，才能够得到同情。

 

  接下来的那么一段话也不是空话，这段话的意义在于说明情况，宣示决心，表达诚意，提出问题。什么情况呢？就是我“智术短浅，遂用猖獗”；什么决心呢？“志犹未已”；这样才提出了“君谓计将安出”，请足下说说看，我该怎么办呢？他这样一番心意，诸葛亮当然是理解的，也是同情的。而且诸葛亮也非常清楚地明白刘备提出的关键问题，“君谓计将安出”，不是说主上蒙尘，我们皇上现在日子不好过该怎么办，而是我刘备智术浅短，遂用猖獗，至于今日，一直寄人篱下，颠沛流离，成不了大事，该怎么办？所以诸葛亮对这个问题的回答不从“奸臣窃命，主上蒙尘”说起，他回答他一个实实在在的问题，是什么呢？诸葛亮为刘备分析当今天下的形势，他说当今天下的形势是什么呢？是

“自董卓已来，豪杰并起，跨州连郡者不可胜数。”

  什么意思？就是自从董卓作乱以后，各路诸侯分封割据，抢占地盘，我们大汉王朝已经到了一个大家都不管皇帝死活，只管自己抢占地盘的时代，就是这样一个形势。在这样一个形势下，我们该做什么呢？很清楚，我们也得抢占地盘。因为不管你的政治理想、政治抱负、政治目标是什么，是实实在在的真的要保卫我们当今皇上呢，还是为了实现个的野心，不管你是什么目标，也不管你是什么抱负，总之都有一个前提，必须有一块根据地。

  在刘备和诸葛亮这一问一答当中，是很有文章的，而诸葛亮对刘备提问的回答是非常实在的。我们很多人崇拜诸葛亮，在我看来是没有崇拜到点子上，诸葛亮最值得我们学习的一条就是他的务实精神。刘备他处于那样的一种身份和立场，他必须从“奸臣窃命，主上蒙尘”说起，但是诸葛亮作为一个政治家，在两个人在密室里密谈的时候就不要再讲这些套话了，就得来点干货，干货是什么？咱也弄一块。

 

  ＊在隆中的对话中，诸葛亮开篇就给刘备吃了一个定心丸，指出了刘备当时的问题关键所在，就是刘备必须有一块自己的根据地，才能实现个人的理想。这显示出了诸葛亮的务实精神，因为只有有了根据地才能谈得上恢复汉室。可是寄人篱下的刘备该把哪里作为自己的根据地呢？他有什么资本来获取自己的根据地呢？

  下面的问题就是，刘备一直是颠沛流离，寄人篱下，要啥没啥的，也能弄一块？诸葛亮说能，为什么呢？他说你可以看看曹操嘛，他说：

“曹操比于袁绍，则名微而众寡，然操遂能克绍，以弱为强者，非惟天时，抑亦人谋也。”

  你想想当年曹操和袁绍两个比，曹操名微而众寡，名声没有袁绍大，人马没有袁绍多，但是最后怎么样呢？曹操把袁绍干掉了，什么原因呢？一个叫做天时，一个叫做人谋，也就是说诸葛亮用这样一个事实告诉刘备：成事在天，谋事在人。看你会不会“谋”，如果会谋，那么现在你这个情况，你就好比当时的曹操，曹操就好比当时的袁绍，曹操能够以弱胜强，你刘备也可以以弱胜强啊，强弱它不是绝对的，也不是永恒的，强弱是矛盾的对立双方，而我们知道辩证法怎么告诉我们的呢？就是矛盾对立的双方无不在一定的条件下相互转化，弱者可以变强者，强者也可能变弱者，条件是什么呢？非惟天时，抑亦人谋也。

 

  这个道理讲清楚了以后那还不解决问题呀，下面诸葛亮再实实在在地替刘备谋划，怎么人谋呢？那我现在就给你谋一谋，我们来看一看当今天下的形势。我相信当时密谈的时候恐怕是有一张地图的，我们现在也来看看这个地图，北方是什么样的情况呢？北方原来冀州、青州、幽州、并州四州是袁绍的，兖州、豫州、徐州三州是曹操的，现在曹操已经把袁绍灭掉了，这一块地方是曹操的。那么曹操这个地方你能不能去打他的主意呢？诸葛亮说不行，为什么呢？他说：

“今操拥百万之众，挟天子而令诸侯，此诚不可与争锋。”

  这个太厉害了，政治上正确，有一面在当时看来正义的旗帜，保卫皇帝，力量又强，这个我们不能去跟他正面交锋。那么再看下面东边，江东地区，这块地方怎么样呢？诸葛亮说：

“孙权据有江东，已历三世，国险而民附，贤能为之用，此可用为援而不可图也。”

 

  这个地方已经经过父兄三代的经营，政权非常稳固，这个地方我们只能跟他联合、联盟，也不能打他的主意。那么可以打主意的地方呢？两个地方，第一个是荆州，我们来看看地图就知道，荆州这块地方有多大，荆州当时号称七郡，也号称八郡，因为它当中有一个郡，章陵郡是有时候设有时候废的，但是七个郡是没有问题的。而且这个地方我们看看地图，按照诸葛亮当时的说法是，它的北面是汉水和沔水，它的南面是现在的广东、广西，它的东面是现在的江苏、浙江，它的西面是现在的重庆、四川，兵家必争之地，也是英雄用武之地，这是个好地方。更好的是什么呢？其主不能守，这个地盘的主人他守不住，所以诸葛亮说：

“此殆天所以资将军，将军岂有意乎？”

  这个地方就是天准备送给你的，要不要啊？这是明知故问，刘备这个时候上无片瓦，下无立锥之地，随便给他个地方他都得要，何况是荆州这个好地方还有不要的？所以不需要回答，这个设问是不需要回答的。

  接着再往下讲，另外还有一个地方益州，来看看地图就知道，益州这个地方也很大，当时的益州包括什么呢？包括现在的四川、重庆和陕西南部的一部分，就是汉中，就是汉中、巴郡、蜀郡等等这些地方都在当时的益州这个范围之内，尤其是汉中平原和成都平原，这两个地方诸葛亮说是“沃野千里，天府之土”。我们现在都知道成都平原那是天府之国，而且四面是山，当中一个平原，沃野千里，四季常青，物产丰富，易守难攻，而且当年高皇帝刘邦就是在汉中平原发迹的，他封的汉王嘛，所以诸葛亮说这也是一个好地方。这个地方现在属于谁呢？蜀这个地方属于刘璋，汉中属于张鲁，这两个人都不行，都不是好领导，所以这两个地方的人叫做“智能之士思得明君”，都盼望着有一个英明的君主去领导他们，那意思说这地方也是天准备送给你的。

 

  ＊可以想象，在当时很落魄的刘备，听了诸葛亮这一番精辟透彻的分析，心中一定是暗喜，认为自己兴复汉室的大业终于有望了。可是刘备是当时军阀中最弱的一个，不用说曹操、孙权的实力远远比他强，就连刘表、刘璋、张鲁实力也不如。那么，诸葛亮说得如此诱人，刘备难道没有自知之明吗？诸葛亮为刘备的指点迷津究竟可行吗？刘备凭借什么才能实现自己恢复汉室的梦想呢？

  好了，这两个地方既然是天要送给你的，那不要白不要，他当然没有明说，我们也懂这个意思，我们就把它拿下。拿下了以后怎么样呢？诸葛亮说：以将军您的声望，“信义著于四海”；以将军您的身份，“帝室之胄”；再以将军您的号召力，“总揽英雄，思贤如渴”。有这个身份，有这个名望，有这个号召力，你只要拿下这两个地方，就有了一个稳固的根据地。然后我们在这个根据地里面一方面把内部的政治搞好，另一方面把外部的关系搞好，联合孙权，意思就是说，那你就有一个独立王国了，当然这个话也没有明说出来。有了这个独立王国怎么样呢？一旦天下有变，您就派一位上将军从荆州北上，取道宛城，进攻洛阳，将军自己从益州出发，取道秦川，进攻西安，那个时候天底下的老百姓还不拿着酒、拿着菜、拿着饭、拿着肉夹道欢迎将军您吗？叫做：

“天下百姓熟敢不箪食壶浆以迎将军者乎？诚如是，则霸业可成，汉室可兴矣。”

  如是，如果这样的话，那你就成功了嘛。这番话说得刘备是醍醐灌顶、如梦方醒、恍然大悟，哦，原来所谓霸业或者帝业就是这样实现的，哎呀太好了，他说：“善！”太好了。当然，这个最终的目标没有实现，如果实现了的话，那么我们中国历史上要出现一个“后后汉”，因为你不好再它什么了，只好叫“后后汉”。

新鲜感过了你就要离开了对么  海是倒过来的天 我是深七

海是倒过来的天 你是触不到的边 或许只要你在身边我就会觉得心安

患得患失一直都在阻拦着我的脚步 最美的不是诺言而是你留下的雕塑

我不会跟时光走远这场路途会太短 就算走也走的缓慢能否走过这一晚

你所不知道的偶遇其实都是我刻意 所以我对你的微笑总会在你不经意

爱过几年才能停 雨下几天才会晴 丢盔弃甲的我在你眼里是输还是赢

我想说我不是冷血我也更不是慢热 我就是我没有错 彻底我才去难过

不要再去给我希望然后又让我失望 但你幸福我会开心即便那也是假装

嘴上什么都没说 心一直为你唱歌 我的伤口越来越多要笑我的最洒脱

,我一直在把你追
,追到你能为我归
,只要你说不要走
,我愿抛下我所有
,风吹到了这杯酒
,也带走了你的手
,风吹乱我心跳
,在我眼里忘不掉
,不管现在怎么笑
,都是苦涩的味道
,追着风我等着雨
,流着眼泪想着你
,遍体鳞伤的自己
,最后还是没有你
,风带走我牵挂
,它知道我放不下
,付出太多的代价
,还是没把你留下
,天空飘满彩云烟
,任风吹到我身边
,想到你我思绪万千
,好像有你的昨天
,风吹灭我的梦
,怎能叫我不心痛
,留下对你的心动
,不知还有什么用
,你说天空很美丽
,留在风中的记忆
,你还装作不在意
,你也随着风而去
,原谅我这一生不羁放纵爱自由
,也会怕有一天会跌倒
,背弃了理想 谁人都可以
,哪会怕有一天只你共我

,不管谁在谁不在 我仍坚持学喊麦
,现实朋友说我古怪 可这就是我是最爱
,我在麦克风里讲 讲我多年的梦想
,为了梦想拼命的嚷 直到如今嚷破嗓
,我把声线当筹码 我拿青春赌一把
,可是时间慢慢催打 声音越来越沙哑
,我知道我声线在变 变得自己都讨厌
,为了当初心愿 我甘愿假装听不见
,天空渐渐变了色 青春慢慢的走过
,我也逐渐变失落 感受风吹的寂寞
,这一路我摇摇晃晃 总是会跌跌撞撞
,可是另类变了模样 还有几人不失望
,当初一颗赤子心 为了喊麦努力拼
,从开始我拼到如今 拼不会的是光阴
,名已更 刀已扔 隐姓埋名刀剑封
,从此我的下半生 发誓不会在出征
,战袍脱 盔甲卸 抹掉从前和一切
,就算天崩地也裂 我也要选择退三界
,弃山河 弃乾坤 万马归林不在奔
,放下一生九五尊 独自落魄到黄昏
,皇城外 古城内 万将为我守黄位
,既然我要选择退 独自感受这滋味
,仰望这天马行空 徘徊在来去之中
,面对着人走人拥 我为何还想不通
,想不通也看不破 这一切都为什么
,当初另类的气魄 再无当年的本色
,想不通也看不清 何为另类之精英
,我这另类雇佣兵 却是晚辈垫脚星
,想不通也看不清 何为另类之精英
,我这另类雇佣兵 却是断了翅的鹰
,最初的一批人还在坚持最初的梦想
,我们的另类梦想 加油

王者 荣耀
峡谷巨龙咆哮
战斗开始 收起浮躁
血战中路河道
荣耀 王者
点燃一场战火
金戈铁马 逝如破竹
一生何人敢惹
寒风吹 繁星落
圣剑裁决斩邪恶
众英豪平分秋色
是项羽还是亚瑟
赤兔 在身下跨
偃月刀我手中画
尔等小人怕不怕
河道旁我一字大
荆轲 她还在藏
猛虎怎会怕群狼
一转身的这辉煌
本就应该这么狂
长版坡上一身傲
一人一马走王道
白龙吟战狼虎豹
赵云在此修要闹
紧跟着团战
节奏不能太乱
河道两旁 硝烟弥漫
杀得天昏地暗
三路硝烟迷魅
一枪将你击退
三分天下隆中对
卧龙诸葛辅刘备
自古貂蝉伴吕布
方天画戟为你镀
闲云野鹤云中步
紧盯中间这条路
青梅煮酒论功高
斩断天地这一刀
让着野区战火烧
鲜血枭雄数曹操
传说纣王宠妲己
半壁江山都不理
倾国倾城无人比
千年修行为了你
自古英雄佳人伴
霸王别姬人间盼
乌江自刎红尘断
虞姬项羽万人叹
这剑气它破金角
这蛟龙它还在咬
透甲枪 向上挑
韩信就该用的巧
上古神箭数后裔
百步穿杨何人替
这一箭我用尽全力
千里送你下地狱
身披金甲站云颠
七十二变斗苍天
这一生我法力无边
斗战胜佛这一篇
月下钟馗捉厉鬼
九生九世不曾悔
奈何引路通向北
饮不下这孟婆水
惩恶扬善一颗心
一生多少的功勋
狭路相逢谁敢拼
混世魔王程咬金
天下英雄难取舍
峡谷之中铮王者
三路河道无处躲
让我燃起这战火

,当我熄灭手中的烟还是不能把你牵
,耿耿你就像是毒让我情乱在旅途
,这些年我糊糊涂涂但你就是我救赎
,十好几年的光阴我心沉沦到如今
,为了你我把命拼我只为赢得你的心
,为你画的那些画你可看出我牵挂
,万里山河脚下踏不如与你到白发
,迟迟钟鼓初长夜耿耿星河欲曙天
,我想一直在你身边想进入你的心间
,不经意间的打闹让我迷上你的笑
,每次见你都在心跳你像我喝的毒药
,我一直在你身后却不能伴你左右
,其实我早已都看透还是我不够优秀
,看见余淮牵你手我好像一个小丑
,以后的路自己走只是想你会发抖

,如来 你今何在 那一战我不认败 紫金玉凯尚还在 谁的掌中写无奈
,是谁在头带金箍 脸上写了一句输 手持铁棒的匹夫 怎配让这世人哭
,花果山上那声吼 曾让天地为你抖 是谁绑了一双手 在给天当一条狗
,若我碎了这半生 他也不去与天争 不败二字不在心中 那不是我孙悟空
,天要我无情无爱 只换这金身还在 齐天大圣四字豪迈 一杆战旗迎风盖
,尔等说我这个妖 不知这天有多高 待我把这生死烧 再去东海走一遭
,对不起我不成佛 就让我当个妖魔 我想要我就去夺 这天地能奈我何
,成了佛又有何用 是如来你编的梦 这一棒要天地痛 请叫我齐天大圣
,西游是一场骗局 让这凡人着了迷 往事又有谁去提 谁来写我的无敌
,天蓬 你那段情 那轮月是谁的名 若是天 也知道疼 可敢战到雷雨停
,卷帘 这五百年 提笔写了一字焱 琉璃盏你没凑全 到头又有何人怜
,我们杀了唐三藏 然后稳坐凌霄上 和五百年前一样 谁来伴我走一趟
,人参果下的尸骸 一直都在等我来 天书写的真是白 真相在我眼中埋
,这哪吒成了傀儡 那杨戬半生已毁 封了天下人的嘴 这人间真的好美
,五百年前的云烟 铁棒画不出的冤 我曾飞过了天边 未曾见过有西天
,不想听也不想看 我高兴我就去乱 谁不服你便来战 生来就要最璀璨
,南天门我一人举 生死勾销这一笔 坐在凌霄殿龙椅 都是我一时兴起
,花果山上的焦土 再见不到的歌舞 看大王再灭仙府 抵这五百年的苦
,凌霄殿上走一遭 众仙谁敢不弯腰 这一次我只出一招 快把龙袍玉玺交

我想过我们的未来
我想睡醒时一睁眼看见的就是你
也想我左手牵的永远都是你
我想用一百种方式去留住你
可是我做了一千件事
却还是感动不了你
哼 可能是我自作多情吧
遇见你我一意孤行没有在意输和赢
我还记得那支风铃上面刻着你的名
那时我们都很年少嘴角总会有微笑
想去聆听你的心跳想去抚摸你容貌
你我畅谈聊到很晚埋怨时光它太短
哪怕整天多愁善感心里也会很温暖
渐渐我 习惯有你 誓言想要为你许
你已是我心的靠椅深刻在我的心里
就像夕阳伴随余温我愿守护你一生
想要与你不离不分做你深夜引路灯
当我为你手捧鲜花对你说着心里话
残忍拒绝转身一刹让我潸然而泪下
我不知道什么原因让我走到了如今
可能是我没有看清没能走进你的心
为你付出这么多 从来没有过退缩
心事不知对谁诉说只能写成一首歌
这颗心已被击碎 留我自己在回味
深夜躲在街头买醉我是如此的狼狈
难以放下这心酸 让我如此的难堪
你的今后与我无关所有痛苦一人担
丢了那支旧风铃 不再铭记你的名
怪我太过自作多情付出太多的真情
以为真心就会赢 对你一意而孤行
怪我太过自作多情付出太多的真情

Learning lines in the rain

The graveyard scene
The golden years
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Freeze frame screen kiss
Hot heads under silent wigs
Fall guys tumble on the cutting room floor
Look-a-likes fall on the cutting room door
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Learning lines in the rain
Special effects by Loonatik and Drinks
Freeze frame, screen kiss, hot heads, lights (headlights?) and power (powder?)
It's patently obvious
She's in parties
It's in the can (twice)
Hot lines under a rain of drum
Cigarette props in action
Dialogue dub, now here's the rub
She's acting her reaction
She's in parties
It's in the can 

The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
The pressure's on, no time to lose
Inspiring dreams, all shattered and blown away
Gathering dust, the band played on again
Personal reasons, are problems in the way
Waking up with just enough time to spare
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Searching out thoughts, we set ourselves a sight
Power and death are always on our minds
The cause is laid out, no looking back for me
The future holds the key for us to see
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

I dare you, to be real
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower in night fright
Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal
I dare you to speak of your despise
For bureaucracy, hypocracy- all liars
I dare

I dare- you- you
Persuadido por su madre
de que nunca sería un buen general,
aturdido por las bombas
que él decía esquivar.
Sin la medicación necesaria
decidió programar
un viaje a ninguna parte,
donde nadie lo pudiera encontrar.
Y a doscientos veinte kilómetros por hora,
tres días sin comer ni dormir,
le paró un coche de la Guardia Civil
y le pidió su documentación y él dijo ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.
Nominado para un Oscar
en la cumbre de su madurez,
venerado por la crítica
y por los jóvenes también.
A camino entre París y Tokio,
cada gesto suyo lo hacía sucumbir,
su mujer era su musa
y sus cinco hijos brillaban en torno a él.
Impoluto e inmaculado
fue a recibir su galardón,
pero antes de caerse desplomado al suelo
retorció su alma al grito de ...
Yo soy el hijo de Dios,
yo soy el hijo de Dios.

作词 : Burgess, Fielding, Lever ...
I'm gazing at faces
Staring blankly at me
I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times
I lost my direction while dodging the flak
Oh give me a hint or something 
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
How long will they wait 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
Obnoxious actions
Obnoxious results
Teachers who refuse to be taught
Distorted pictures
And dizzy, dizzy people
Rush by me at the speed of thought
Sitting at tables
And throwing the scraps
For Christ's' sake leave them something
Now they can erase us
At the flick of a switch
Will they hesitate 
No!
There must be something wrong boys
They're dragging me down
Eden
There's no Eden, anyway.
They're dragging me down
You either swim or you drown

,But the two old-timers who visit when they’re in town
,The credits are rolling as they walk out
,
,I get to my screen
,With the phantom audience sat there waiting for me
,But they don’t complain where I take a seat
,It seems
,Even now, I still stop by
,Most stories look better wide
,And I feel at peace here, ’cause
,While the adverts might’ve changed
,The popcorn tastes the same
,And in the end the day’s always saved
,So once the picture stops
,I let the hours pass, distracted in the dark
,
,Even now, I still stop by
,Most stories look better wide
,And I feel at peace here, until
,The lights come up bright
,When it’s over
